Title: This School Is Teaching Thousands of People to Love Chocolate - Bloomberg

In a country long renowned for its cocoa beans, it’s a little ironic that until recently, Indonesia’s inhabitants haven’t had much of a taste for chocolate.
The average Indonesian eats just 300 grams (0.7 pounds) of chocolate annually, a sliver of the nine pounds or so put away by the average American, according to Euromonitor. But as incomes rise, tastes are slowly changing and global industry giants are positioning themselves to take full advantage of the sugar rush to come. At the same time, the country’s cocoa industry is slipping.
While Indonesians tend to indulge their sweet tooth with traditional treats like fried bananas and flavored sticky rice, Asia’s demand for chocolate is forecast to grow at nearly twice the global pace, according to market surveys. To serve that growing appetite, Zurich-based 
 opened its first chocolate factory in Indonesia last year. U.S. rival 
 opened a $100 million cocoa processing facility in East Java, its first in Asia, three years ago. And in 2011, Tulip Chocolate — whose products sell to businesses in Asia and the Middle East — opened its 
. 
“We felt it was in our interests to help people understand the full potential and opportunities of creating quality chocolate products,” William Chuang, chief executive officer of Tulip owner PT Freyabadi Indotama, wrote in an email. Freyabadi is a privately-held partnership between 
, the world’s largest producer of edible fats, and 
, an arm of Singapore-listed Delfi Ltd., a regional confectionary business.
Most locally made commercial chocolate uses “compound,” in which vegetable fat substitutes for the cocoa butter found in higher-quality “couverture.” Compound is a lot cheaper and resists the tropical heat better, but has a waxier taste. Tulip sells both kinds, but its Chocolate School is attempting to raise the bar.
On the third floor of a Jakarta shopping arcade, students carefully work molten chocolate on a marble counter to achieve the right temperature and crystal structure. They fill plastic molds then leave the bars to cool as they move on to other things: blending a passion-fruit ganache, hand-painting and filling trays of pralines, lunch.
Finally, the moment of truth, as a freshly-minted bar is popped out of its mold. Its lustrous shine shows the chocolate is well-tempered and the texture will be smooth.
But chef Nanang Priatna, leaning in for closer inspection, points to a couple of tiny gaps in the edges between the bar’s segments. That means trapped air bubbles, despite the best efforts of the novice chocolatier.
“It’s OK, it’s not bad,” Mr. Nanang says charitably. “It’s a first try.”
Mr. Nanang — who honed his skills at some of Jakarta’s top hotels and in the chocolate capital of Brussels — is a fervent evangelist for the “food of the gods.” About 2,000 students from around Asia have taken the Chocolate School’s classes in Indonesian and English, where tools ranging from toothpicks to spray-paint guns are deployed to form and decorate bars, pralines, hollow figurines and more.
Legend has it two Spanish ships brought cocoa beans to Indonesia from the New World in the mid-16th century. By 1720, the Dutch had established cocoa plantations around what is now Jakarta.
The sector boomed after World War II but production has been declining lately in part due to aging trees, disease, flooding and the like.  Many small farmers, who dominate production here, have switched to commodities such as palm oil and rubber, which are easier to grow and potentially more lucrative.
Despite the government’s revitalization efforts, the cocoa industry today is running at only 49 percent capacity, generating about $1.4 billion, according to data from the Ministry of Industry.
As in colonial days, most of the beans are shipped abroad.
“Traditionally, this has been a place where things are grown and exported but not consumed,” said Albert Taylor, an Australian who recently graduated from the Chocolate School, along with his wife and daughter. They produce premium coffee from a plantation in north Sumatra and are considering making their own chocolate too, targeted mainly at international travelers passing through duty-free shops.
Most of the school’s students have been entrepreneurs looking to “get in on the chocolate boom,” said principal Mervyn Pereira. Not all have been successful. “We warn them that just because you take a few courses in the Chocolate School doesn’t mean they are ready to open their own business.”
Celcys Leman, a 26-year-old hospitality school graduate, is starting an online bakery from her home. “Cake is my passion,” Leman said. She took the two-day, 3.25 million rupiah ($240) chocolatier course to learn garnishing and decorating skills.
“You can’t go wrong with chocolate,” she says.
The Chocolate School has offered marketing lectures, but focuses more on proselytizing than profit.
“The school is not self-sustaining. It was never meant to be,” said Mr. Chuang. “However as the interest in chocolate grows … we hope the school will be able to stand on its own feet.”

Title: Best Winter Vacations for People Who Want to Do Nothing at All - Bloomberg

It's a request travel experts get more often than you think: What if a person wants to go somewhere wintry, and do ... nothing?
Sure, the snow and cold weather offer plenty of active delights: skiing, sledding, trekking, ice fishing. But let the masses head to ski resorts and the hardcore head off into the backcountry. For a certain set, it's other things they're after: dog sled rides, solving puzzles, going to concert performances, racking up some serious hot tub time, and just parking one's self in front of the fire. Thanks to the destinations below, you can do all that and less while wrapped in the lap of luxury. 
From November through February, 30-foot swells and gale-force winds lash the western shores of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, putting on an awesome show for guests at the 
. The Wick, as regulars call it, was designed for storm watching, a favorite childhood pastime of the owner. Each of the 75 rooms has unobstructed Pacific views, a gas fireplace, and a soaking tub. Intrepid guests can don ponchos and wellies and experience a “west coast facial,” which occurs when the rain goes sideways in the wind and massages your face as you walk along Chesterman Beach. Too intense? Book a Pacific Sea Salt Glow facial at the Ancient Cedars Spa and Zen out to the sound of crashing waves. 
Schloss Elmau brings the best of New York or Berlin to a tranquil valley in the Bavarian Alps in southern Germany. The 
—composed of a 162-room, family-friendly hotel, a 47-suite retreat, and six spas—is the ultimate digital detox. Its world-class concert hall hosts 200 performances a year (with tickets included in the room rate), including a popular Chamber Music Festival each January and literary talks from authors such as Ian McEwan and T.C. Boyle. Though the hotel offers Apple TV and high speed Wi-Fi, why not unplug your devices and chill out in the three libraries and on-site bookstore instead? 
There’s nothing cozy about the Alaskan wilderness, unless you’re staying in one of the five knotty pine guest cabins at Winterlake Lodge. Operated by the Dixon family, 
 is set on 15 acres overlooking a frozen lake and primarily accessible by seaplane. The lodge has its own team of huskies, and Carl Dixon gives mushing tutorials, but he’ll happily take the reins while guests enjoy views from the sleigh. Head into the wild on a helicopter safari in search of elk, moose, caribou, and badgers, then return to pre-dinner wine and cheese by the fire. Carl’s wife, Kirsten, is an award-winning chef, so save room for her multi-course dinners of reindeer tenderloin with duck fat potatoes and mushroom-and-truffle gnocchi. 
Fashion-industry veterans Giorgia and Stefano Barbini reimagined a 16th century hunting lodge in Italy’s Dolomites as a luxurious mountain escape for friends. Now San Lorenzo Lodge, their 
, mixes classic alpine decor  with updated touches such as underfloor heating and a spruce sauna. In the winter, Stefano hosts woodcarving workshops and leads moonlit snowshoe tours. This being Italy, though, food is at the heart of the experience. Each evening, Giorgia prepares a feast of regional recipes, which Stefano pairs with wine from the stable-turned-1,500-bottle cellar. 
Set on a 4,200-acre estate at the foothills of Tennessee’s Smoky Mountains, 
 is the perfect place to hibernate for a winter weekend. With a working farm, craft brewery, and one of the deepest wine collections in America (160,000-plus bottles) this is foodie nirvana. Leisurely days start with digging into fluffy egg-topped cheese grits and crispy bacon while watching the fog roll across the mountains.  Read in a rocking chair, get pampered at the Wellhouse Spa, or sign up for a winter-enrichment weekend focused on such obsessions as puzzling or photography. Evenings revolve around fancy farm-to-table meals in a restored barn and often end with a nightcap of Pappy van Winkle by the fire in the Hickory Room. 
Fogo Island, located off the northern coast of Newfoundland, is about as off-the-grid as one can get. Its austere landscape is even more extraordinary in the winter, when the 29-suite 
 becomes a haven for artists, foodies, and burnt-out urbanites looking for rest and relaxation. Guests looking to connect with nature can track caribou by snowshoe or, in March, view giant sheets of ice floating down Iceberg Alley from Greenland to the North Atlantic. An artist-in-residency program and a 37-seat cinema satisfy cultural cravings, while rooftop hot tubs are meant for meditative star-gazing sessions. 
Located just a half-hour’s drive from the major ski resorts in southern Vermont, 
 feels like an elevated take on the classic New England bed-and-breakfast. Its famous soufflé pancakes are reason alone to book a stay. A main lodge, housed in an 18th century farmhouse, features four rooms decorated with vintage flags, antique quilts, and other Americana. Sixteen individually designed cottages are scattered across the 300-acre grounds, all with fieldstone fireplaces and screened-in porches. Guests can go sledding out the door then thaw out in the spa’s Japanese 
, a type of sleek, wooden bathtub. For a more social stay, check out the inn’s 
 event series, which includes furniture-making workshops with local woodworker Thomas Shackleton and murder mystery weekends. 
Dude ranches are best known for action-fueled summer activities. When the snow falls, rates drop and the pace slows. At Triple Creek Ranch, an adults-only, 
 in Montana’s Bitterroot Range, the focus shifts from cattle drives and horseback riding to snowshoeing and ice fishing. Couples hunker down in log cabins equipped with wood-burning fireplaces and, in most cases, hot tubs; oftentimes, they don’t reappear until dinner. Meals at the Relais & Châteaux-approved restaurant (think wagyu beef with caramelized fennel home fries, paired with a rare Bordeaux) are a highlight of every stay.

Title: Billionaire Pinera Set to Win Chile's Presidential Election - Bloomberg

Billionaire Sebastian Pinera is set to win the second round of Chile’s presidential election, one month after his failure to win a commanding advantage in the first round triggered a market sell-off.
Former President Pinera had 54.5 percent of the vote with 91.7 percent of the ballots counted, the electoral service said on its 
 Sunday. Alejandro Guillier, the candidate for the ruling coalition, had 45.5 percent.
“It’s a done deal,” said Roberto Izikson, head of public affairs at the market analysis company Cadem. “Sebastian Pinera will be the next president of Chile.”
A return for Pinera to the presidency would provide a respite for industry after four years of the most radical reforms in three decades under President Michelle Bachelet, including increased corporate taxes and moves to empower labor unions. While saying he won’t overturn those reforms, he has backed a limited reduction in corporate taxes. By contrast, Guillier had portrayed himself as the continuity of Bachelet’s government with a spending program that he estimates at $10 billion.
“It looks like becoming the biggest margin of victory for a right wing government in recent history,” said Kenneth Bunker, director of the electoral program at the Universidad Central. Still, “Pinera will face a very fragmented Congress. He will be a moderate leader with no legislative majority.”
Pinera has pledged to more than double economic growth, create 600,000 jobs, ease industry regulations and narrow the budget deficit. It is his pro-business agenda that helped push the benchmark IPSA stock index to a record high before the first round of voting. 
Chile has endured the slowest four years of growth since the early 1980s following a slump in copper prices. The Latin American country is the world’s biggest producer of the metal, which accounts for about half of export revenue.
Pinera’s pro-business approach and his track record of faster growth in his first term could add 0.6 percent to growth compared with Guillier, said Sebastian Edwards, a professor at University of California at Los Angeles.

Title: Why Haven’t You Heard of This Artist That Investors Love? - Bloomberg

The German-born, New York based painter Michael Krebber is supported by a dream team of dealers and collectors.
His work, which toys with art history by challenging perceptions of what a painting can look like (he’s painted text from webpages, made paintings that appear to be doodles, or unfinished), is represented by a list of galleries that reads like an 
 
 checklist: 
 in New York, 
 in Paris, 
 in Brussels, 
 
, which has locations in Berlin, Cologne, and New York, and 
 in London. 
His collector base, meanwhile, is prestigious, discreet, and fervent: “I find the group of collectors who buy his work are incredibly devoted,” says the adviser Eleanor Cayre, who collects Krebber’s art. “This group only seems to be getting larger and larger, particularly now as we’re seeing many museums and institutions joining the fray.”
Despite that pedigree, Krebber has remained surprisingly under-the-radar, a virtual unknown to those in the broader art world, let alone the mainstream public.
“He’s a significant artist, and he falls into a category that’s typically called “painters’ painters,” says art adviser Allan Schwartzman, who’s placed Krebber’s art with numerous clients. “That means a painter who’s revered by other painters but barely known to collectors.”
There are signs that this is about to change. This year, a significant exhibition of Krebber’s work traveled from the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art in Porto, Portugal, to the Kunsthalle Bern in Switzerland. A catalogue raisonné, which is a compilation of every work the artist has ever made, is currently in the works.
Most telling, after a sluggish couple of decades on the auction market, Krebber’s art—while still comparatively affordable compared to his peers’ million-dollar results—is beginning to inch upwards in price. (Currently, you can buy a painting of his for the tens of thousands and a drawing for under $10,000.)
“At the end of the day, show me a painter who’s been working for 30 years—and has been as influential as Krebber—that you can buy for less than $100,000,” says Pierre Orlowski, a London-based dealer and collector. “In 10 years, you’ll see Krebber selling for a million dollars.”
That prediction will hinge on whether the artist—even his strongest supporters acknowledge that he makes “difficult” art—can reach and connect with a broader audience. 
“Ultimately, what takes an artist to the next level is the integrity and presence of the art they make,” says the dealer Carol Greene of Greene Naftali, whose gallery sold a work by Krebber for around $100,000 at Art Basel in Miami Beach earlier this month. 
Krebber, who was born in Cologne, Germany, in 1954, studied painting at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Karslruhe, Germany. He was an assistant in the studios of superstar German artists Martin Kippenberger and Georg Baselitz. (Krebber’s supporters often point to these affiliations, both as proof of his pedigree and to underscore the dramatic difference in their and Krebber’s prices.)
But unlike the aforementioned German painters, Krebber’s paintings and drawings are often minimal and occasionally inscrutable. A recent series that’s become highly sought-after is his so-called “Snail” set of paintings, which sometimes consist of only one line. Other series have the uncanny feel of (very) unfinished abstract paintings.
That’s the point though, says Greene. “For Krebber, painting is a performance,” she says. “It’s incredibly risky to put two marks of paint on a canvas and call it a painting.” What some might perceive as hard to understand, she continues, is in fact the product of careful and deliberate choices by the artist. “There’s something to be said for humility,” she says. “And withholding marks, that conveys a different kind of experience.”
“He’s a painter that’s succeeded with making the most with the least,” says Orlowski. “He’s created this unfinished aesthetic.”
Starting in 2002, Krebber became a teacher at Frankfurt’s Städelschule (he left the position in 2016, when he moved to New York), in the process influencing a group of younger artists who have become, over time, devotees.
“When we did our last show of his work, a bunch of students took an eight-hour train from Germany to the opening,” says Thomas Arsac, a director at Chantal Crousel. “They literally didn’t have enough money to rent a room for the night, so they came to the opening, came to the dinner—because Krebber invited them—and then they went home.”
That level of devotion is another thing dealers can point to as proof of Krebber’s significance: “It’s important to underscore how much Krebber is a key figure of the art world,” says Ayelet Yanai, a partner at Dépendance gallery. “He’s influenced a lot of the young artists of today.”
Influential as he might be, Krebber’s market, at least until recently, was a slow burn. His first painting to come to auction, according to Artnet, was 
painted around 1992-1993. It came up to the block at Christie’s South Kensington in 1999 with an estimate of $2,000 to $3,000 and failed to find a buyer, as did a second work from the series that came up the the same day. 
It took an additional decade for his next work to appear, when a watercolor sold at a small Swiss auction house for less than a thousand dollars. It wasn’t until 2012, when an untitled black-and-white painting sold for $10,181 at the Parisian auction house Artcurial, that one of Krebber’s works publicly broke the $10,000 mark.
His primary market was similarly sedate, mirroring, more or less, the auction market. But in the last five years, dealers say, things have begun to pick up. Paintings began popping up at auction and selling, with some regularity, well above estimate. 
A 2014 sale at Christie’s New York saw a painting soar above its high estimate of $9,000 and sell for $52,500; the next year, a painting executed in 2000 had a high estimate of $40,000 and sold for $100,000; and the year after that, in 2016, a painting from 1997 carrying a high estimate of $112,000 sold for $237,296 at Sotheby’s in London.
On the primary market, dealers say, his work has been on a similar upward trend. Today, his drawings sell for $7,500, says Greene, and paintings range from $40,000 up to $250,000 for multi-panel paintings and installations. Orlowski says he’s sold Krebber paintings privately for $300,000.
The question, then, is what it will take to push those numbers even higher. Orlowski says that when the catalogue raisonné publishes it will “change the market.”  The market of an artist, he says “is driven by masterpieces, and people don't realize yet how many masterpieces Krebber has made.”
Schwartzman has a more measured outlook. “He has all the signifiers of someone who’s undervalued,” he says. “But does it take one year for it to happen, or 15? I don’t know.”

Title: Top Mining Stock Becomes 2017's Worst Loser on China Steel Shift - Bloomberg

Billionaire Andrew Forrest is facing one of his toughest tests in the coming 12 months. His Australian iron ore producer is the only stock on the nation’s blue-chip resources index to hand investors a loss in 2017, tumbling from its status as the top performer last year.
The reason -- China’s steel mills are favoring higher-quality ore produced by 
’s competitors, and the Perth-based producer’s rivals insist the shift 
.
Incoming Chief Executive Officer Elizabeth Gaines, who’ll take the job in February after a year as chief financial officer, arrives in the post at a moment of rapid evolution for the company, founder and Chairman Forrest said last month. Here are the key issues Gaines and a 
 face:
China’s mills are using better quality raw materials to produce steel with fewer emissions to comply with the nation’s anti-pollution push, and to lift output amid record margins. It’s a change that’s sent 
, and seen the discount Fortescue must accept for its lower-quality products widen to an estimated 31 percent in the the final three months of the year, according to UBS Group AG.
Fortescue, which 
the change in China would be short-term, will now aim to deliver more than half of its output with over 60 percent iron content, Forrest said last month. The supplier currently produces iron ore with an average of 58 percent content, compared to an industry benchmark of 62 percent.
“It’s an acknowledgment that the strategy they’ve been pursuing so far is perhaps not sustainable,” Melbourne-based RBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Hissey said by phone. Raising quality may mean higher mining costs, while it could be 
 before Fortescue can take advantage of better grade material from a new mine, he said.
The producer’s investment in processing and “blending is critically important to our long-term sustainability and competitiveness as a supplier of raw material to our customers,” outgoing CEO Nev Power said in a statement. Fortescue will continue to refine strategy to “maximize our cash margins regardless of the impact of market volatility,” he said.
Perth-based Fortescue, which surged more than 200 percent in 2016 and was the No. 2 performer in the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index, has lagged competitors this year, slumping 17 percent as iron ore prices have retreated and it holds volumes steady. 
Profits are forecast to fall more than a third to $1.3 billion in the 12 months to June 30 and continue to decline in the following year, 
 to the average of 19 analysts’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.
Ratings agencies also 
 the producer must continue to slash its debt, cut to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2017 from a peak of over $10 billion four years ago, before 
 can be lifted to investment-grade status.
While Fortescue boosted sales outside China in the half ended June 30, the nation continued to account for 93 percent of revenue. Amid forecasts for slower growth and declining 
, the company is 
 in other markets including the U.K., Germany and India, Power said last month. Fast-growing parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Vietnam, are also a 
.
Capital expenditure is forecast to rise more than a quarter to $908 million in fiscal 2018, while Fortescue expects to spend as much as $1.5 billion within the next three years to develop a mine and railroads to replace the aging Firetail operation. The producer will take a decision before July on a potential expansion of the 
, estimated in 2013 to have a $1.5 billion development cost.
Lowering production costs, slashed more than 60 percent over the past three years, is becoming harder as Fortescue handles larger volumes of waste rock and longer haul distances. The entire industry faces new pressures from more expensive raw material inputs, coal to manganese producer South32 Ltd. said last month.
Fortescue is preparing to diversify beyond iron ore, according to Forrest, who said last month he’ll take an active role in the expansion efforts and who has previously floated options to add 
, or to operate 
. Investors remain wary over major growth spending by miners, RBC’s Hissey said.
The producer plans to “build on our operational reputation to drive future growth through product diversification and asset development,” Power said in his statement.
The producer is advancing work to find copper and gold, with about 8,000 square kilometers of exploration ground in New South Wales and South Australia, and 32 concessions in 
, filings show. “While there is always risk in diversifying, we believe Fortescue will do it slowly, and only if the right project comes their way,” said Jeremy Sussman, a New York-based analyst with Clarksons Platou Securities Inc.

Title: America’s Inequality Machine Is Sending the Dow Soaring - Bloomberg

The Great Recession is a speck in the rear-view mirror for America’s financial markets. They’ve advanced far beyond pre-crisis levels. In fact, Goldman Sachs 
 you can go back a century before 2008, and still not find a “bull market in everything” like today’s.
If the real economy had roared back the same way, 
 might not be president. Instead, it’s been a grind. While unemployment is near a two-decade low, wages have grown slowly by past standards. They’re nowhere near keeping pace with the asset-price surge.
Elected on a promise of better jobs and pay, Trump is about to pull the most powerful lever any government has for firing up the economy: fiscal policy. By slashing taxes on corporate profits, its authors say, the Republican 
 will unleash the animal spirits of American business -- and everyone will benefit.
A rising tide does lift all boats -- but nowadays, in the U.S., not equally. Under both parties, recoveries have become increasingly lopsided. The current one has helped millions of people find work; it’s also benefited asset-owners far more than people who trade their labor for a paycheck. Income distribution, already the most unequal in the developed world, is getting worse. And that’s starting to influence everything from America’s spending habits to its elections.
“The story of our time is polarization -- by party, by class and by income,” said Mark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital in Washington, and co-author of a 2017 book about the Federal Reserve. “I don’t see anything in the tax bill to make that any better.’’
The Fed’s post-2008 toolkit included massive purchases of financial assets, which supported a liftoff on the markets but took time to trickle through to the real economy. Trump’s tax critics say his plan will have a similar effect, because companies will spend the windfall on share buybacks or dividends, instead of job-creating investments. Plenty of executives say that’s 
.
Bank of America’s most recent 
 program totals $18 billion. Chairman Brian Moynihan championed the tax proposal this month. “It’s good for corporate America, and it’s good for us,” he 
.
There was an echo there of one of the American business world’s 
. As applied to the Trump tax cuts, it’s highly misleading, according to Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors.
This isn’t a case of “what’s good for General Motors is good for the U.S.,” said Minow, who’s dedicated her career to pushing corporations toward long-term investments in people and businesses. “In my list of the top 100 things companies should do for sustainable wealth creation, buybacks would be number 100.”
Companies in the S&P 500 Index bought $3.5 trillion of their own stock between 2010 and 2016, almost 50 percent more than in the previous expansion. The pace has slowed in the last two years. The tax bill could 
. 
Buybacks have fueled the stock rally (there’s disagreement about how 
 they played). And the rally’s biggest benefits go to the richest. On Twitter last week, Trump invited his followers to check their swelling retirement accounts. Only about half the country’s households have any such 
.
Soaring markets helped the top 1 percent of Americans increase their slice of the national wealth to 39 percent in 2016, according to the Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances. The bottom 90 percent of families held a one-third share in 1989; that’s now shrunk to less than one-quarter.
Republicans are gambling that they can run the economy so hot that companies will hire more workers, and eventually boost their wages. There’s a strong argument that the private sector can train them better than government programs can.
“The more growth we have, the more that benefits everybody,” said Ike Brannon, a former Bush administration Treasury official who’s now president of Capital Policy Analytics, a consulting firm. “It forces businesses to train people at the fringes.” He points to the late 1990s, when growth averaged more than 4 percent and the poorest one-fifth of households saw substantial income gains.
Looming in the background then was a technology-stocks bubble. It burst in March 2000, plunging the economy into recession. What happened next is telling -- it illustrates the perverse asymmetry of bubbles. In the following three years, those poorest households saw their incomes fall more than twice as much as their richest counterparts.
The pattern was repeated after the even bigger housing crash of late 2007. Today, even after an increase of more than 9 percent over two years, incomes at the bottom are short of pre-crisis peaks, while higher earners have comfortably surpassed them.
Japan, which is also preparing corporate tax cuts, 
 to make them available only to businesses that increase spending on wages and investment. In the U.S., companies are flush with cash but they’re using it to buy more customers via mergers, or reward capital through dividends, according William Spriggs, chief economist at the AFL-CIO, the country’s biggest labor union group. 
American workers won’t put up with any more business cycles that yield them few gains, he says. “This is the last time they can get away with it, because the backlash is going to be huge.”
In the end, the trend toward inequality amounts to capitalist suicide, Spriggs argues. Companies need demand, which requires rising wages so that workers can afford goods and services. “Businesses can’t create themselves, they respond to general growth in income,” he said. “Inequality chokes off business development.”
Support for that kind of argument is surfacing in unlikely quarters.
The International Monetary Fund used to be so entwined with American government thinking that its preferred market-friendly recipe was known as the Washington Consensus. Now, the Fund is cautiously backing redistributive measures -- 
 of the Trump administration in the process.
In October, the IMF 
 rich countries can share their prosperity more evenly, without sacrificing growth, by shifting more of the tax burden onto high earners. It warned that “excessive inequality can erode social cohesion, lead to political polarization, and ultimately lower economic growth.”
The U.S. is already experiencing some of those strains.
During last year’s election campaign, both major parties effectively broke in half. In both cases, an outsider candidate scored unexpected wins by running against the party establishment, and railing at an economic system they said was rigged against ordinary Americans.
Self-described socialist Bernie Sanders surprised pundits by mounting a serious challenge in the Democratic contest. Trump won his party’s nomination and the presidency. He told voters he had experience on the buy-side of American politics, having paid for favors from both parties, and so was well-placed to fix a “broken system” dominated by corporate lobbyists.
Now, Trump is about to hand corporations -- which are already making high profits by historical standards -- a giant tax cut. The bill “addresses problems we don’t have, and makes existing problems worse,” said Alan Krueger, an economics professor at Princeton University. “Especially the deficit, inequality, health care, and infrastructure investment.”
If the tax changes end up helping markets most, they’ll be widening a gap noted last month by JPMorgan Chase’s chief investment strategist, Jan Loeys. There’s not much sign of “economic overheating,” which happens when companies start spending more on wages and other inputs, Loeys argued. “Financial overheating, in contrast, is well advanced,” he wrote. “It merits monitoring a lot more closely for signs of bubble-trouble.” 
Even Trump’s Treasury has flagged the danger. Last week, the Office of Financial Research made its annual 
 to Congress on the vulnerabilities of the financial system. It was sanguine about most of them, from inflation and bank solvency to debt levels.
But the agency, which color-codes its assessments, did see one major threat -- from market risk. That gauge is at red alert.

Title: Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day - Bloomberg

The U.S. tax-cut bill advances toward passage, Australia’s prime minister wins a reprieve and Donald Trump prepares to call out China as a threat. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about.
The fractious Republican caucus in the Senate has lined itself up behind compromise tax-reform legislation, the culmination of a six-week sprint designed to deliver a major policy victory for their party and President Donald Trump before year’s end. With corporate and individual tax rates set to fall, a preliminary score from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation showed the bill increasing federal deficits by $1.46 trillion over 10 years -- before accounting for any economic growth that might result. Votes are planned in the House and Senate by the middle of the week. Trump predicted the economy is “going to start to rock” thanks to the legislation. 
The world’s biggest exchange starts trading
in bitcoin at the start of the week, the latest step toward mainstream recognition of the cryptocurrency that has garnered attention for its massive run-up in price this year. The CME Group Inc. will be following its Chicago rival Cboe Global Markets Inc. in introducing derivatives on bitcoin, which has surpassed $19,000 this month after starting the year under $1,000. Having futures contracts will allow investors to short, or bet against it, as well as get exposure to the cryptocurrency on a regulated exchange. 
In a demonstration of how successfully China is moving up the value chain in global production, an electric-car maker from the country has launched sales of its 
 just three years after its foundation, with a model that undercuts the price of a rival from pioneer Tesla Inc. The move comes days after news that China’s top smartphone makers are 
Apple Inc. on its home turf in the U.S., with Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi Corp. in talks with American wireless operators to sell their flagship products to consumers as soon as next year. The increasing competition of Chinese value-added products presents a challenge to the U.S., which has recorded record trade deficits thanks to its trading partner’s low costs. President Trump plans to mention China in a keynote national-security speech scheduled for Monday, when he will call out the country for engaging in “
,” the Financial Times says. 
A by-election shored up Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s government, restoring his majority in the lower house of parliament. John Alexander, of Turnbull’s Liberal Party, will return to parliament after claiming victory in the district of Bennelong, defeating Labor candidate Kristina Keneally, a top-tier contender, as a former leader of the respective state. The win is a reprieve for Turnbull, who had lost his majority amid a citizenship fiasco gripping parliament. More than a dozen lawmakers across various parties have been caught out by a constitutional rule that bars dual nationals from being parliamentarians -- with some unaware their parents’ heritage sometimes automatically bestows them with citizenship of other nations. While Turnbull’s grip on the helm tightened for now, Labor leader Bill Shorten said that if the marginal swing toward Labor were replicated at the next national election due by 2019, Turnbull would be ousted.
U.S. stocks rallied to new highs on Friday and the dollar strengthened as the tax bill made progress in Congress. The S&P 500 Index, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 Stock Index closed at records. Asian investor focus turns to the Bank of Japan, which meets to set policy this week amid lingering suspicions among some market players that Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may fine tune stimulus next year. Other central banks setting policy this week are in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Taiwan and Thailand. Athletic wear giant Nike Inc., FedEx Corp., CarMax Inc., Bed, Bath & Beyond, drugstore operator Rite Aid Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. are among companies scheduled to announce earnings this week. The U.S. and U.K. update their estimates for third-quarter GDP and China releases property-price data.

Title: Fox Clarifies Murdoch's `Nonsense' Sexual Harassment Comments - Bloomberg

21st Century Fox Inc. sought to clarify comments by Rupert Murdoch after the co-chairman’s earlier remarks about sexual harassment allegations at Fox News drew ire online.
“It’s all nonsense,” Murdoch 
 Thursday in response to a question from Sky News about whether the harassment allegations had hurt business. “There was a problem with our chief executive sort of over the years, but isolated incidents. As soon as we investigated he was out of the place in hours -- well, three or four days -- and there’s been nothing else since then.”
Fox on Saturday said Murdoch used “nonsense” in reference to the idea that business was affected, not to describe sexual harassment or the claims at the company.
“Rupert never characterized the sexual harassment matters at Fox News as ‘nonsense,’” a spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. “Rather, he responded negatively to the suggestion that sexual harassment issues were an obstacle to the company’s bid for the rest of Sky.”
Fox is seeking to 
 Sky, a British pay-TV company in which New York-based Fox has a 39 percent stake. U.K. regulators are reviewing the bid.
Roger Ailes was ousted from Fox in 2016 after women including former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson accused him of sexual harassment. Murdoch didn’t mention former star Bill O’Reilly, who was forced out this year amid sexual harassment allegations.
“That was largely political, because we’re conservative,” Murdoch said after his comments about Ailes’s ouster. “Now of course all the liberals are going down the drain,” the billionaire added, citing allegations against stars at NBC and CBS. “There are really bad cases that people should be moved aside, and there are other things which probably amount to a bit of flirting, you know?”
Fox News isn’t among the 21st Century Fox assets that 
 is 
 in its $52.4 billion movie studio and cable deal announced Thursday.
“Under Rupert’s leadership and with his total support, the company exited Roger Ailes, compensated numerous women who were mistreated, trained virtually all of its employees, exited its biggest star and hired a new head of HR,” the spokeswoman said. “By his actions, Rupert has made it abundantly clear that he understands that there were real problems at Fox News.”

Title: Stockholm Housing Slump Set to Deepen, State Mortgage Bank Warns - Bloomberg

Stockholm’s property market is falling.
Home prices in the capital have already slumped about 9 percent over the past three months, but probably have further to drop, according to the state-owned mortgage bank, SBAB.
The mortgage market in the Swedish capital has reached a tipping point triggered by a sudden increase in supply. At the same time, the prospect of stricter mortgage rules will shut a significant portion of potential buyers out of the market, according to SBAB, which is the country’s fifth-largest mortgage lender.
“The aggregated price data for Sweden as a whole may not look so dramatic, but there are things happening in central Stockholm and in cities such as Uppsala and Orebro where there is an extra large supply of newly built apartments,” SBAB Chief Executive Officer Klas Danielsson said in an interview. “Prices in Stockholm city are now down about 10-15 percent, and may well drop another 10 to 15 percent.”
Nationally, Swedish property prices have dropped 7.3 percent over the past three months, according to the Nasdaq OMX Valueguard-KTH Housing Index.
After years of housing shortages and surging prices, the largest Nordic economy’s property market is now cooling fast. The market correction is biggest in the priciest corners of Stockholm, where supply is outstripping demand. A stricter amortization requirement, due to come into force in March, and nervousness among buyers are also driving down prices.
The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority argues that stricter mortgage rules are needed to tame rising household debt, which it says poses a threat to financial stability. The regulator is 
by SBAB’s owner, the government. 
While the regulator estimates that 14 percent of new mortgage customers will be affected by the measure, Danielsson says the watchdog could be underestimating the measure’s effect.
He says he’s “extra worried about the new amortization requirement and that the impact will be somewhat bigger than others think.”
SBAB has analyzed the potential impact on new customers to find out how many would be affected by the requirement. According to its calculations, 10-15 percent of them might not even be able to borrow.
“Some may think that 10-15 percent is not that much, but that’s the wrong way to see it,” he said. “If 10 percent is removed from the demand side, it’s quite a lot. It can have major effects in the areas where supply is too high.”
According to the CEO, the measure is ill-timed because banks have already tightened lending criteria, the market is cooling down and the full impact of previous measures haven’t yet been fully evaluated. Rather than detailed measures, politicians should focus on tax and rent regulation to fix the underlying problems in the housing market, he said.
While SBAB expects further declines, other analysts says the worst may have passed.
Andreas Wallstrom, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB, said on Dec. 14 that while home prices plunged last month, “November is history and recent statistics are rather encouraging.” According to Nordea, prices have 
 since mid-November and up until the first week of December, with averages per square meter even rising somewhat in both Stockholm and the country as a whole. Nordea expects prices to be “relatively stable” in coming months.
But Danielsson says he’s braced for “further price declines and some unpleasantness in the market, especially in selected areas.”

Title: The Force Is Strong in British Film. Brexit Opens the Dark Side - Bloomberg

Chiara Costantino moved to London from her native Italy four years ago seeking a job as a computer effects artist for films. Today she works at an animation shop called Jellyfish Pictures where she most recently created explosions and the Millennium Falcon’s jumps to light-speed in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” the likely blockbuster that opened this week. Even though she’s prospered from the move, Costantino says that after Britain voted to leave the European Union, she wouldn’t recommend that friends follow her. “I don’t tell people to come,” says the 30-year-old with dyed-white hair and a nose-ring. “I can’t assure them it will be the same as when I got here.”
While Britain’s movie industry is unquestionably booming, a big part of the prosperity can be attributed to the country’s position as part of the larger European film business—and Brexit could threaten that. It’s not uncommon for cast and crew to quickly shuttle to locations across Europe—parts of “The Last Jedi” were filmed in Ireland and Croatia—a practice that might be undermined by new visa restrictions or bureaucratic processes. And British producers enjoy EU financing to get projects off the ground as well as marketing support for their films on the Continent, benefits that would likely evaporate after Brexit.
Rebecca O’Brien, producer of “I, Daniel Blake,” which won the top honor at the Cannes Film Festival last year, says pulling it together without Europe would have been a “nightmare.” Without European backing, “the budget would’ve been severely cut,” she says.
U.K. spending on feature film productions has doubled over the last 10 years, to 1.6 billion pounds in 2016, the British Film Institute reports. The Harry Potter and James Bond franchises have long been based out of the U.K., and this year’s hit “Paddington 2” was filmed at locations across Britain. The industry directly employs about 80,000 people, up 40 percent since 2010, and contributes 4.3 billion pounds to the economy, according to the BFI.
The biggest concern among producers is staffing. The British Film Institute figures that in the next five years 10,000 skilled people—from make-up artists to carpenters—from outside Britain will be needed to fill new jobs. Brexit will threaten one of the industry’s greatest strengths: the ability to assemble a world-class creative team at short notice, says Phil Dobree, chief executive of Jellyfish, where more than 80 of 200 employees are from continental Europe. 
Foreigners “don’t feel like there’s a future for them here,” says Dobree, who says hiring has gotten harder since the Brexit vote. “It’s a very, very sad thing for our country.”
Like virtually every other British business, the U.K.’s film sector is lobbying the government for access to talent. Ideally, many producers say, Britain would simply avoid imposing any new limits on immigration after breaking ties with the EU, but that seems unlikely given that an end to free movement was a key pledge of the Brexit campaign. 
The British Screen Advisory Council, a lobbying group for the U.K.’s audio-visual sector, is advocating exemptions for companies deemed strategically important or facing particular skills shortages. Immigration restrictions threaten “our position as a world-class location for filming,” says Pete Johnson, the council’s chief executive. “Those who can help grow sectors of the future are precisely the people we need.” 
Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the British Film Commission, a government agency that supports international film-making in the U.K, says the industry’s concerns may be overblown. Production in the country will continue to benefit from world-class studios and a deep pool of expertise in everything from finance to set-building to acting, plus a tax scheme that gives producers a 25 percent rebate on money spent making movies in Britain.
“We are by quite a long way one of the healthiest sectors in the whole of the U.K. economy,” says Wootton. “Our job is to ensure we keep it that way.”
So far, Brexit has provided a financial tailwind, with the depreciation of the pound making it cheaper to shoot in Britain: Inward investment in the British film sector jumped 39 percent to 1.6 billion pounds over the first nine months of 2017, the highest on record, according to the BFI. At Pinewood Studios, a sprawl of warehouses in leafy Buckinghamshire 20 miles west of London, Disney’s live-action remake of Dumbo has just wrapped shooting and work is starting on the next installment of Star Wars, slated to begin filming there next year.
The currency boost, though, shouldn’t be a cause for complacency, cautions Neil Hatton, chief executive of the U.K. Screen Alliance. The global film industry is highly competitive and other countries will look to lure work from Britain, he says. And while Brexit talks appear to have broken out of a deadlock, big questions still remain about what happens on exit day in March 2019. 
“Anyone who builds the success of their industry on the collapse of their own currency is asking for trouble,” Hatton says. “Let’s not rely on that.”

Title: China Seeks Financial Cooperation With U.K. - Bloomberg

China wants to deepen financial and investment links with the U.K. as Britain seeks to boost two-way trade once it leaves the European Union.
In an investment boost for U.K. businesses operating in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, the U.K. government announced up to 25 billion pounds ($33.3 billion) in financial support, including loan guarantees, as part of the bilateral trade talks this weekend in Beijing.
Other agreements included speeding up the London-Shanghai Stock Connect initiative, which will mean investors in each country will be able to trade shares listed on the other’s stock exchange. Steps to establish a bond connect between the two countries that will help open up the bond market to mutual trading were also announced along with a new feasibility study on making China accessible to U.K.’s asset management sector.
Vice Premier Ma Kai said both countries should also push cooperation to a new level in areas including nuclear-power generation, manufacturing, high-speed rail, high-end manufacturing, and trade and investment liberalization.
“The United Kingdom has obvious financial advantages and its financial development is robust,” Ma said at the ninth annual U.K.-China Economic and Financial Dialogue in Beijing on Saturday. “Both sides have great potential for cooperation. Make financial cooperation a new bright spot in the ‘golden age’ of Chinese-British relations.”
Ma is holding talks with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, with the two signing about 1.4 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) of trade and investment deals. China currently buys 16.8 billion pounds a year of British exports. That compares with the 230 billion pounds of goods and services Britain sells to the EU.
“These talks show the U.K. is truly open for business and we look forward to continuing the Golden Era of U.K.-China relations,” Hammond said in a statement.
Hammond is in China for two days of talks, accompanied on the visit by Business Secretary Greg Clark, Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, and London Stock Exchange Chief Executive Officer Nikhil Rathi, as well as several junior ministers and a wider business delegation.

Title: Tesla Tells New Taxi, Uber Drivers Not to Use Its Superchargers - Bloomberg

Professional drivers looking to buy a Tesla to shuttle paying customers around should consider this: After Friday, vehicles used for commercial purposes won’t be allowed to use the company’s Superchargers anymore, according to an 
.
The change in rules applies to vehicles being deployed as taxis -- including by drivers for 
 or 
 -- as well as cars used for commercial deliveries or government purposes. The policy shift is intended to keep the high-speed battery chargers available for other customers without immediate access to home or workplace charging.
“Currently, in some areas, heavy Supercharger use by commercial customers such as taxis can occasionally impact availability for other drivers,” Tesla Inc. said in an emailed statement, noting that the change will “encourage the fair use of Superchargers by as many customers as possible.”
Tesla said in the online policy it could limit or block a vehicle’s ability to use the stations if the drivers violate the new rule. The company said it also might exclude certain charging stations or occasional trips from the new policy.
“We encourage the use of Teslas for commercial purposes and we’ll work proactively with these customers to find charging solutions that work best for them,” the emailed statement said.
Superchargers are intended to provide fast charging along main highways during long-distance travel, though the network’s been expanded to include 
 center locations as well. In Manhattan, where Tesla 
 Friday, there are two Supercharging stations, with an additional nine coming to the area soon.

Title: Coal Is Fueling Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise - Bloomberg

Bitcoin has a dirty secret.
The cryptocurrency has wowed markets this year with breakneck gains as investors flocked to an asset that exists only in cyberspace. But the laborious creation of each digital bitcoin by private computer networks has real-world consequences in the form of massive energy use -- including from fuels that cause the most pollution.
Eight 100-meter-long metal warehouses in northern China are a case in point. Bitmain Technologies Ltd. runs a server farm in Erdors, Inner Mongolia, with about 25,000 computers dedicated to solving the encrypted calculations that generate each bitcoin. The entire operation runs on electricity produced with coal, as do a growing number of cryptocurrency “mines” popping up in China.
The global industry’s power use already may equal 
 U.S. homes, topping the individual consumption of 
, according to the Digiconomist Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. As more bitcoin is created, the difficulty rate of token-generating calculations increases, as does the need for electricity.
“This has become a dirty thing to produce,” said Christopher Chapman, a London-based analyst at Citigroup Inc.
Energy has always been part of 
’s DNA. The person credited with creating the currency, identified only as Satoshi Nakamoto, devised the system that awards virtual coins for solving complex puzzles and uses an encrypted digital ledger to track all the work and every transaction. As the market grew from a hobbyist culture in 2009 to a global phenomenon this year, ever-more computing power was needed by large networks.
Bitcoin prices have surged more than 2,000 percent in the past year on some exchanges and touched a record of more than $17,900 on Friday. Cboe Global Markets Inc. began offering bitcoin futures on Dec. 11, reaching $18,850 on the first day of trading. There are other 
, such as ethereum and litecoin, but bitcoin is by far the largest.
China, which gets about 60 percent of its electricity from coal, is the biggest operator of computer “mines” and probably accounts for about a quarter of all the power used to create cryptocurrencies, according to a study of the industry published in April by Garrick Hileman and Michel Rauchs at Cambridge University.
About 58 percent of the world’s large cryptocurrency mining pools were located in China, followed by the U.S. at 16 percent, the researchers said. China is the biggest producer and consumer of coal, and server farms in provinces such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Heilongjian are heavily reliant upon the fuel.
Estimates of how much electricity goes into making cryptocurrencies vary widely -- from the output of one large nuclear reactor to the consumption of the entire population of Denmark. But analysts agree that the industry’s power use is expanding rapidly -- especially after a price rally that made bitcoin almost four times more valuable than just three months ago.
Total electricity use in bitcoin mining has increased by 30 percent in the past month, according to Alex de Vries, a 28-year-old blockchain analyst for accounting firm PwC.
“The energy-consumption is insane,” said de Vries, who started the Digiconomist blog to show the potential pitfalls in cryptocurrency. “If we start using this on a global scale, it will kill the planet.”
Some analysts 
 such claims as alarmist, noting that even the high-end estimates of demand account for only about 0.1 percent of what the world uses. Advances in technology also may make operations more energy efficient.
Still, it’s getting more expensive to produce cryptocurrency as the energy use of the process rises. Miners -- especially the big ones -- will look for the cheapest power to better weather price volatility, according to the Cambridge study. Electricity costs in China, which has surplus capacity of coal-fired generators and vast reserves of the fuel, is well below what consumers pay in the U.S. or Europe.
Bitcoin’s algorithm dictates that after a certain number of tokens are created, more work is required for the next batch, said James Butterfill, the head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities Ltd. in London who has been studying cryptocurrency markets.
Using estimates of electricity prices and the rising speed with which calculations must occur, Butterfill estimates the marginal costs of each bitcoin will more than double from $6,611 in the fourth quarter to $14,175 in the second quarter of 2018. At the start of 2017, the cost was $2,856. With costs rising, there’s a greater risk for miners should prices tumble.
“You’d be hard-pressed to find anywhere where it isn’t profitable to mine,” said Butterfill,  who set up computers at his home in England to mine tokens in his spare time and joined a network of 120,000 others to boost processing capacity and returns. “But if you’re investing in a bitcoin rig, you have to look at the long term, and with the volatility as high as it is, it probably still doesn’t make sense to mine bitcoin in Europe.”
Not all cryptocurrency mining is dirty. Computers in Iceland get power from geothermal plants. Even in China, some are clustered around hydroelectric facilities in Sichuan and Yunnan.
In Austria, Hydrominer IT-Services GmbH put servers inside hydro-power plants. It was the cheapest option, said Michael Marcovici, a company founder, who began mining in 2013.
“Frankly, we didn’t start this as an environmental project,” Marcovici said. “It is bad for bitcoin to have this news all the time about this dirty energy. People don’t want dirty energy to be used. But the problem is, in Europe, the energy is just too expensive.”

Title: Why New Roadblock for Dealmaking May Be Vertical - Bloomberg

For decades, U.S. antitrust enforcers have worried mostly about mergers between direct competitors that might lead to higher consumer prices. They’ve been less bothered by deals between companies that are in related businesses but don’t compete directly. That could be changing with the Justice Department’s 
 to block an $85.4 billion merger between AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc., which combines a distribution company with a content provider. The shift in enforcement raises the possibility that similar types of combinations could hit a roadblock, slowing down the pace of 
Horizontal and vertical. In the horizontal kind, a company buys one of its competitors. Imagine if Toyota Motor Corp. bought General Motors Co., or Apple Inc. acquired Samsung Electronics Co. These are the types of deals that have raised antitrust worries in the past. Vertical deals, on the other hand, unite companies that operate at different levels of production or distribution, as is the case with AT&T and Time Warner. Think of Toyota or Apple buying one of their many parts suppliers. These deals don’t increase concentration in an industry because they don’t combine head-to-head rivals.
They potentially give an acquirer market power, depending on the shape of the industry. By taking out a competitor, the buyer may be able to raise prices on its own or in coordination with the remaining players. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have successfully challenged many of these types of deals. For example, the Justice Department in early 2017 stopped two health-insurance mergers -- Anthem Inc.’s proposed takeover of Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc.’s deal with Humana Inc.
In theory, they can make a company more efficient by giving it cost advantages over rivals. Those lower costs can be passed on to customers in the form of lower prices. Yet vertical deals also can 
 by, for example, giving a company the power to raise the operating costs of its rivals. In the Time Warner case, the Justice Department 
 AT&T could charge higher rates for, say, Time Warner’s HBO, which produces the "Game of Thrones" series. That would push up costs for rival distributors such as Dish Network Corp., which presumably would pass on those higher costs to its customers. The case is set to go to 
 on March 19.
Enforcers have long recognized that vertical deals can present a host of problems that harm competition. It’s just that they tended to fix them through settlements in which companies agreed to restrictions on how they would conduct business in the future. When Comcast Corp. bought NBCUniversal in 2011 -- a vertical deal that united Comcast’s distribution with NBCUniversal’s content -- Comcast agreed to dozens of conditions. Many had to do with content-licensing to address the government’s 
 that Comcast would be able to harm online-video rivals like Netflix Inc. or Amazon.com Inc. by raising the cost of NBCUniversal content or withholding it altogether. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department views those kinds of fixes skeptically, a stance 
 by those who say these conditions 
.
CVS Health Corp.’s $68 billion 
 for Aetna Inc., also a vertical merger, could be next in the Justice Department’s crosshairs. It has the potential to reshape how Americans receive health care by uniting CVS’s pharmacies and drop-in clinics with an insurer. The companies say the deal would make basic care more convenient and less costly, but there’s also the risk that CVS might steer Aetna’s insured members to its pharmacies whether or not they live or work near one. 
Walt Disney Co.’s $52.4 billion 
 of many 21st Century Fox Inc. assets is mostly a 
 combination. But it raises some of the same concerns the Justice Department has with the AT&T-Time Warner deal. By combining its ESPN network with Fox’s 22 regional cable networks devoted to sports, Disney could force distributors to buy bigger bundles of content, for example. That would hurt rivals such as Dish Network’s Sling TV that are only interested in individual channels.
Trump’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has thrown out the playbook for resolving antitrust concerns in vertical deals. Days before suing AT&T and Time Warner, Delrahim criticized the behavioral settlements that enforcers have used to set requirements on how a company operates. Such conditions mean that the government must become a roving regulator to closely monitor a company’s affairs, he said. These settlements are hard to enforce, eventually expire and ultimately aren’t 
 for competition problems, Delrahim 
 antitrust lawyers in Washington. He’s testing that view on the AT&T-Time Warner deal: Instead of negotiating a behavioral fix, he’s seeking the sale of Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit or DirecTV, AT&T’s satellite-TV operator.
Delrahim’s preference for asset sales over behavioral fixes raises the bar for getting vertical deals approved. But analyzing whether antitrust is entering a new era is made tougher by 
. The Time Warner lawsuit has sparked speculation that the decision to block the deal wasn’t motivated by antitrust concerns but by Trump’s disdain for CNN, part of Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit. No evidence has emerged that Trump interfered in the review, but Delrahim will have to establish a longer track record to quell doubts about his approach to vertical mergers.
So far, no. The Justice Department shares antitrust enforcement with the FTC, which hasn’t staked out a new position on vertical deals and behavioral settlements. But in a January merger 
, the agency said its past behavioral fixes had successfully maintained competition, a sharp split with Delrahim’s view. The FTC, however, was led by a Democrat when it published the study. Trump’s pick to lead the agency, Joseph Simons, who hasn’t yet been confirmed by the Senate, could take a different approach.

Title: Suspicious Deaths of Billionaire Canada Couple Investigated - Bloomberg

Canadian police continue to weigh whether to open a homicide investigation after the deaths of billionaire pharmaceutical executive Bernard “Barry” Sherman and his wife shocked the country’s corporate and political worlds.
The bodies of the 75-year-old founder of 
 and his wife Honey Sherman were found in their home in the Toronto neighborhood of North York on Friday under what police called suspicious circumstances.
Tributes poured in from prominent Canadians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. As media reports citing anonymous sources surfaced Saturday, the Shermans’ children issued a statement calling for a full criminal investigation, and criticizing the police and the media.
“We are shocked and think it’s irresponsible that police sources have reportedly advised the media of a theory which neither their family, their friends nor their colleagues believe to be true,” the Shermans’ children said. They derided “rumors” about the circumstances of the parents’ deaths, adding that the pair “shared an enthusiasm for life.”
“We urge the Toronto Police Service to conduct a thorough, intensive and objective criminal investigation, and urge the media to refrain from further reporting as to the cause of these tragic deaths until the investigation is completed,” the family said in the statement.
Toronto police were waiting on autopsy results, which were expected on Saturday, before determining if the service’s homicide unit would take over the case.
“We are treating the deaths as suspicious,” Toronto Police Constable David Hopkinson said in a phone interview. Investigators aren’t searching for any suspects at this time, he said.
Tributes flooded in as news of the Shermans’ deaths spread. “Our condolences to their family & friends, and to everyone touched by their vision & spirit,” Trudeau wrote on Twitter.
In a 
 on Saturday, Apotex hailed Sherman’s role in growing the company from a two-person firm in 1974 to a global giant -- one of the world’s largest generic drug makers, employing some 11,000 people including more than 6,000 in Canada.
Sherman “gave his life to the singular purpose of our organization -- innovating for patient affordability,” Apotex said in the statement. “Patients around the world live healthier and more fulfilled lives thanks to his life’s work.”
Sherman, who had a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was chairman of the closely held Canadian generic-drug maker and 
 chair of Cangene Corp., a Canadian biotechnology firm. He was ranked recently by Forbes as Canada’s 12th-richest person with a net worth of about $3 billion.
The billionaire held a fundraiser for Trudeau in August 2015, shortly before his Liberals won the election, that was later reportedly investigated by the country’s lobbying watchdog.
Linda Frum, a Canadian senator who recently awarded a medal to Honey Sherman for community service, was among those paying tribute to someone she described as one of the most beloved members of Canada’s Jewish community.
“I am gutted by the loss of Honey and Barry Sherman. Our community is steeped in grief. I am heartbroken,” she said on Twitter.
Eric Hoskins, health minister of Ontario province, described the couple as “incredible philanthropists” and said he was “beyond words right now.” Brad Duguid, Ontario’s minister for economic development, said he was “deeply shocked & saddened.”
The Shermans’ 12,440-square-foot home had recently been placed on the market for almost C$7 million ($5.4 million).

Title: Google AI Researcher Accused of Sexual Harassment - Bloomberg

Sexual harassment accusations have hit another corner of the tech industry, with allegations involving prominent artificial intelligence researchers, including one at Google, a leader in the field.
Data scientist Kristian Lum wrote in 
this week that a man she called "S" grabbed her inappropriately at an industry conference in 2010 and said he took advantage of another woman she didn’t identify on separate occasions. Two people who were told about the conduct from two alleged victims told Bloomberg the man is Steven Scott, a senior researcher at Google.
Lum also wrote that a well-respected academic touched her inappropriately on the leg at the same conference and later sent her innuendo-laced messages. The man was later identified as Bradley Carlin, an expert in biostatistics, by people familiar with the alleged conduct.
The allegations were widely discussed on social media, drawing supportive comments and similar stories from researchers in academia and leading tech companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. Eric Horvitz, a Microsoft research director, called Lum’s post a "powerful and important report."
"I’d love to tell my side of the story, but I’m afraid you’ll need to get it from 
," Scott wrote in an email, referring to Google’s public relations department. 
"Google is investigating the matter," Gina Scigliano, a company spokeswoman, said.
Scott has been suspended from Google as of Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Carlin, a professor at the University of Minnesota, referred questions to the school, which said it is aware of the accusations but declined to comment further. 
The researchers involved are experts in Bayesian statistics, which underpins a powerful type of AI known as machine learning. The accusations have surfaced during a growing debate over the lack of diversity among machine learning researchers and whether computer scientists are paying enough attention to bias – including gender and racial bias – in the data sets they are using to train AI systems.
The allegations came to light after the 
 on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) in Long Beach, California. Some attendees complained that aspects of some parties held during the conference were inappropriate and potentially offensive to women. They also condemned a joke about sexual harassment made by Carlin, a member of an amateur band that performed at the NIPS closing night party.
Carlin, the band’s keyboardist, joked about the sexual misconduct allegations that forced the resignation of U.S. Senator Al Franken. After several attendees complained on Twitter that making light of sexual harassment was inappropriate, Carlin apologized on the band’s Facebook page.
Lum, who was not at the conference, learned of the incident and then wrote in the blog that she was “unsurprised to learn that a person involved in making the troubling comments is a well-respected academic who is widely known to behave inappropriately at conferences.”
Without naming Carlin directly, Lum said the academic had touched her inappropriately on the leg during an informal presentation she gave at a Bayesian mathematics conference in 2010. He also commented on her dress, saying it “was too sexy” for such an academic talk. Over the ensuing years, she wrote, the person sent her several innuendo-laced or inappropriate private Facebook messages, including messages in which he discussed watching pornography.
"I would like to defend myself against her accusations, but the matter has already been referred to my university’s EEO team, which I’m told will be conducting a full investigation into the matter," Carlin wrote in an email to Bloomberg, referring to the University of Minnesota’s Equal Employment Opportunity department. "So I’ve been instructed not to say anything more publicly pending the results of that investigation."
Evan Lapiska, a spokesman for the university, said the school is "aware of public accusations" involving Carlin but declined to comment further citing privacy protections. 
Lum declined to comment. In her post, she detailed further incidents of alleged harassment at the same 2010 conference. The "worst offender," she wrote, was a researcher that she only identifies as "S." At the end of the conference, while she was swimming with other researchers, the person grabbed Lum without her consent and put “his hands on my torso, hips, and thighs,” according to the post. Other female mathematicians spoke similarly to Lum about S, Lum added. And she wrote that he had "taken advantage of a junior person" under the influence of alcohol.
She said that several years later at another conference, during a reception hosted by Google, she overheard the same person bragging to friends about “banging smokin’ hot chicks.” When Lum gave him a castigating stare, he told Lum she was only jealous he hadn’t been talking about her, according to the blog.
"I knew it would be even more difficult to get people to find S’s behavior problematic since he is employed by a large tech company," she wrote.
The person in Lum’s post is Scott, a director of statistics research at Google, according to two people familiar with the situation. Katherine Heller, an assistant professor at Duke University, recognized Scott in Lum’s description and told Bloomberg that he had acted inappropriately with a former student of hers. Heller also said that several other female researchers had reached out to her with similar stories about other men in the field after Lum’s blog post was published. 
"There really is just a lot of sexual harassment of women in Bayesian statistics and machine learning," Heller said. Another person in the field said she had witnessed Scott’s actions with women in the past, but asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the topic.
“Thank you for having the courage to speak out about this terrible behavior," Jeff Dean, head of Google’s Brain AI unit, tweeted to Lum. "This has no place in science, math, statistics, computing, or anywhere else.” Dean was commenting generally and he didn’t respond to an email asking about Scott.
Lum said that after she saw in October that "S" had been nominated as a candidate for the board of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA), she brought concerns about his behavior to the organization’s president and he was removed from the ballot.
Scott, who has been at Google since 2008, was a candidate for the board and is no longer on the ballot, according to ISBA’s website and one person with knowledge of the organization who spoke to Bloomberg.
Kerrie Mengersen, ISBA’s president, did not respond to questions about Scott. But she said in an email that she and ISBA’s executive committee supported Lum coming forward with her account. “The Executive Committee takes any report of inappropriate behavior very seriously,” she said. “We have a great Society and a proud record of including women as members and as leaders. However, like many societies, we have recognized that we need to do more.”
Mengersen said the organization was in the process of establishing protocols for appropriate behavior and support mechanisms for members who have been harassed.

Title: Hunter Harrison, Famed Railroad Turnaround CEO, Dies at 73 - Bloomberg

E. Hunter Harrison, who turned around three railroad carriers during a five-decade career before being tapped by 
 to improve the company’s lackluster performance, has died days after taking 
. He was 73.
Harrison died in Wellington, Florida, on Saturday from complications from a recent illness, the company said in a 
.
“Hunter was a larger-than-life figure who brought his remarkable passion, experience and energy in railroading to CSX,” the company said. “The entire CSX family mourns this loss.”
Harrison, who had heart bypass surgery in 1998, occasionally used a portable oxygen tank to treat shortness of breath. The company announced on Dec. 14 that he would take time off from his duties as chief executive officer -- news that sent shares down almost 8 percent -- and named Jim Foote as acting CEO.
“The Board is confident that Jim Foote, as acting chief executive officer, and the rest of the CSX team will capitalize on the changes that Hunter has made,” CSX board of directors chairman Edward Kelly said in a statement.
By relying on a strategy of cutting costs and implementing procedures to make all parts of the operation more efficient, Harrison transformed 
, 
 and Illinois Central Corp. into rail industry leaders. His reputation among analysts and investors was so strong that CSX shares jumped 23 percent on a single day in January 2017 when reports emerged that Harrison was in talks to take the helm.
At Illinois Central, Harrison gained fame for developing an approach he called “precision railroading,” breaking with the standard industry practice of holding trains until they were full. The approach, which involves running shipments on fixed timetables to ensure reliable deliveries, was a novelty in the North American industry at the time.
“Hunter is a legendary railroader, and for good reason,” Lee Klaskow, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a 2017 interview. “The Canadian railroads have some of the lowest operating ratios, which is driven by his philosophy -- precision railroading. He wrote the playbook on efficiency.”
In his 2005 book, “How We Work and Why: Running a Precision Railroad,” Harrison laid out his core principles for running a rail carrier: service, cost control, asset utilization, safety and people. The volume is still required reading for anyone getting into the industry.
“This book is about running the best damn railroad in the business,” he wrote. “Run a tight ship, and you can expect a reasonable return; manage it badly, and the sheer weight of assets will sink you.”
Precision railroading “is applicable to any railroad,” Harrison told Bloomberg News in a January 2012 interview.
Harrison more than tripled net income during his seven years as Canadian National CEO. When he left the company at the end of 2009, it spent a little more than 67 cents on expenses for every dollar of sales, down from 76 cents at the end of 2002. Harrison was “ transformative,” Luc Jobin, the company’s president and CEO, said in a statement.
In his four-and-a-half years as CEO of Canadian Pacific, Harrison transformed the carrier from the worst-performing major North American railroad to the second-best -- trailing only his former employer, Canadian National. When he left Canadian Pacific in January 2017, the company’s market capitalization stood at about C$28.2 billion ($22 billion) -- about C$15 billion more than when he took over.
“We’re going to do more with less,” Harrison told investors at a presentation in December 2012, less than six months after taking over Canadian Pacific. “We’re going to make those assets really sweat.”
Harrison cut staff and pushed the railroad to run longer and faster trains to reduce fuel and labor costs. He also revamped the executive team, while closing several hump yards -- used to separate and sort rail cars -- and inter-modal terminals in cities including Chicago and Milwaukee to set the stage for potential land sales.
“Professionally, Hunter was unmatched in this industry. He will go down as the best railroader ever, plain and simple,” Keith Creel, president and CEO of Canadian Pacific, said in a statement. “His legacy will be felt at our company forever.”
CP will lower its flags to half-mast across its network to honor Harrison, said Creel, who worked under Harrison at three different companies.
CSX, spurred on by its shareholders, 
Harrison two months after he quit Canadian Pacific and approved picking up the $84 million payout that he left on the table.
Ewing Hunter Harrison was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on Nov. 7, 1944. He began his career in 1963 as an 18-year-old carman-oiler for St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Co., lubricating train wheels while attending the University of Memphis. He moved to Illinois Central in 1989 as chief operating officer, joining Canadian National when it acquired the Chicago-based carrier in 1998.
Harrison was twice named “Railroader of the Year” by Railway Age magazine -- in 2002, while serving as Canadian National’s chief operating officer, and in 2014 for his role at Canadian Pacific -- becoming one of only a handful of executives to win the award twice.
His health emerged as a concern for investors after he joined Canadian Pacific. In 2015, Harrison contracted pneumonia and missed several weeks of work after undergoing surgery to have stents implanted in his legs. In 2017, before being appointed by CSX, he turned down the company’s request that an independent physician designated by the board review his medical records. Even so, Harrison sometimes required “supplemental oxygen” to combat shortness of breath, CSX Chief Financial Officer Frank Lonegro said at an investor conference in May 2017.
For all his successes as CEO, Harrison never managed to pull off a mega-merger that would have created a truly transcontinental railroad. While at Canadian Pacific, Harrison twice tried, and failed, to buy CSX, first in 2014 and again in 2016.
“I’m not worried about my legacy of creating some lasting merger,” Harrison told analysts about railroad mergers in April 2016. “That’s not what I’m about. I’m much more about creating shareholder value.”
After his retirement from Canadian National in 2009, Harrison spent two years raising and training horses at his farms in Ridgefield, Connecticut, and Wellington, Florida. He also served as chairman of the National Horse Show Association of America.
Still, when activist investor Bill Ackman approached him in late 2011 to run Canadian Pacific, the opportunity proved too tempting to turn down. Harrison was eventually hired by Canada’s second-largest railroad in 2012 after Ackman engineered a boardroom coup to oust then-CEO Fred Green.
“I tried other things, and I missed the work,” Harrison said in the January 2012 interview with Bloomberg News. He pledged to stay at Canadian Pacific “as long as I’m needed to turn the organization in the right direction and build some sustainability. This is not some kind of one-time shot to do something overnight.”
While Harrison’s efficiency drive rewarded investors, many shippers felt it did so at their expense. Inconsistent service, poor communication and a lack of available railcars were among the most frequent complaints in a 2015 survey of shippers by RBC Capital Markets. Thirty seven percent of respondents in the RBC poll that year said service at Canadian Pacific was poor, while only 16 percent deemed it to be good.
Harrison’s signature Tennessee twang and sometimes blunt language made him a favorite of analysts and investors. In 2013, describing his first few months as CEO of Canadian Pacific, he likened his progress to that of a U.S. Civil War general, saying he “kind of went through Canada maybe like Sherman went through Atlanta.”
Harrison and his wife, Jeannie, had two children. “We grieve with them in the tremendous loss of a one-of-a-kind railroader and even better person,” said CP’s Creel.

Title: Chinese Electric-Car Startup NIO Prices Debut Model at $67,783 - Bloomberg

Chinese electric-car maker NIO has launched sales of its first vehicle three years after the company was founded, undercutting the price of a rival model from Tesla Inc.
Chinese customers can buy the ES8 sports utility vehicle, with a range of 500 kilometers (311 miles) on a single charge, for 448,000 yuan ($67,783), the company said late Saturday in Beijing. That compares with 836,000 yuan for Tesla’s Model X, and 596,300 yuan for BMW’s gasoline-powered X5.
“Electrification of automobiles provides us an opportunity to change lanes to lead,” said William Li, a founder of NIO. “Our goal is to make charging more handy than refueling."
After raising more than $1 billion from investors led by 
, NIO is preparing for its next phase of growth in the world’s biggest electric-car market. In addition to Tesla, the company will be competing against homegrown rivals such as 
, as well as industry giants Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co.
NIO, formerly known as NextEV, is among several startups to have sprouted in China after the introduction of 
 for new-energy carmakers to help cut reliance on imported oil. As governments around the world consider phasing out fossil-fuel-powered vehicles to curb pollution, automakers are rushing to develop zero-emission technologies, with batteries emerging as the dominant viable alternative to internal-combustion engines.
Last month, VW said it would 
 more than 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) with its partner 
to develop a range of new-energy vehicles, and 
 will spend 5 billion yuan in an alliance with 
The seven-seater ES8 can accelerate to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph) in 4.4 seconds, according to the company. The braking distance of the SUV, equipped with 5 millimeter wave radars, is 33.8 meters (111 feet).
Owners of the ES8 can charge their car by swapping batteries at power-swap stations in three minutes or recharge with the help of “Power Mobile” service vehicles that travel to motorists.
Equipped with Mobileye NV’s EyeQ4 chip, the ES8 also employs NOMI, an artificial intelligence system with functions ranging from adjusting the in-car temperature to communicating with the driver and taking photos.
NIO plans to build more than 1,100 power-swap stations in China by 2020 and have more than 1,200 “Power Mobile” service vehicles. A battery-swap station can be assembled within a day, said Li. The carmaker will also offer other free services including road rescue.
Founded in 2014 by Li and a group of internet entrepreneurs, NIO is also backed by investors including

Title: Everything You Need to Know About the GOP Tax Bill - Bloomberg

Here are key changes to U.S. tax law for individuals and businesses that have emerged from the final Republican bill that’s headed for votes in the House and Senate next week.
(Note: Individual rate cuts would begin in 2018 and expire after 2025.)
Current law:
Proposed: 
Current law: 35 percent
Proposed: 21 percent, beginning in 2018.
Current law: Applies a 20 percent rate as part of a parallel tax system that limits tax benefits to prevent large-scale tax avoidance. Companies must calculate their ordinary tax and AMT tax, and pay whichever is higher.
Proposed: Repealed.
Current law: Individual AMT can apply after exemption level of $54,300 for singles and $84,500 for married, joint filers, and the exemptions phase out at higher incomes.
Proposed: Increase the exemption to $70,300 for singles and $109,400 for joint filers. Increase the phase-out threshold to $500,000 for singles and $1 million for joint filers. The higher limits would expire on Jan. 1, 2026.
Current law: Businesses must take depreciation, spreading the recognition of their equipment costs for tax purposes over several years.
Proposed: Businesses could fully and immediately deduct the cost of certain equipment purchased after Sept. 27, 2017 and before Jan. 1, 2023. After that, the percentage of cost that could be immediately deducted would gradually phase down.
Current law: The U.S. taxes multinationals on their global earnings at the corporate rate of 35 percent, but allows them to defer taxes on those foreign earnings until they bring them back to the U.S., or “repatriate” them.
Proposed: U.S. companies’ overseas income held as cash would be subject to a 15.5 percent rate, while non-cash holdings would face an 8 percent rate.
Current law: Pass-through businesses, which include partnerships, limited liability companies, S corporations and sole proprietorships, pass their income to their owners, who pay tax at their individual rates.
Proposed: Owners could apply a 20 percent deduction to their business income, subject to limits that would begin at $315,000 for married couples (or half that for single taxpayers).
Current law: An individual who fails to buy health insurance must pay penalties of $695 (higher for families) or 2.5 percent of their household income -- whichever is higher, but capped at the national average cost of the most basic, low-premium, high-deductible plan.
Proposed: Repeal the penalties.
Current law: $6,350 standard deduction for single taxpayers and $12,700 for married couples, filing jointly. Personal exemptions of $4,050 allowed for each family member.
Proposed: $12,000 standard deduction for single taxpayers and $24,000 for married couples, filing jointly. Personal exemptions repealed.
Current law: Individuals can deduct the state and local taxes they pay, but the value is subject to certain limits for high earners.
Proposed: Individuals can deduct no more than $10,000 worth of the deductions, which could include a combination of property taxes and either sales or income taxes.
Current law: Deductible mortgage interest is capped at loans of $1 million.
Proposed: Deductible mortgage interest for new purchases of first or second homes would be capped at loans of $750,000 starting on Jan. 1, 2018.
Current law: Qualified medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income are deductible.
Proposed: Reduce the threshold to 7.5 percent of AGI for 2017 and 2018.
Current law: A $1,000 credit for each child under 17. The credit begins phasing out for couples earning more than $110,000. The credit is at least partially refundable to qualified taxpayers who earned more than $3,000.
Proposed: Double the credit to $2,000 and provide it for each child under 18 through 2024. Raise the phase-out amount to $400,000, and cap the refundable portion at $1,400 in 2018.
Current law: Applies a 40 percent levy on estates worth more than $5.49 million for individuals and $10.98 million for couples.
Proposed: Double the thresholds so the levy applies to fewer estates. The higher thresholds would sunset in 2026.
(A previous version of this story was corrected to adjust threshold at which child tax credit would begin to phase out.)

Title: May's Brexit Strategy Faces Challenges Both From EU, Home - Bloomberg

U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit strategy faced new challenges Sunday as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson made a fresh intervention in the debate while comments by the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier may chill hopes for any bespoke deal.
Johnson called for a “liberal Brexit” in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, as he said the advantages of leaving haven’t been properly outlined for the public. He said the U.K. must strike a trade deal that gives it the power to discard EU laws and failure to do so would render Britain a “vassal state” of Brussels.
His comments undermine a fragile 
 that May struck with her warring cabinet in making a deal with the EU this month to move talks onto trade. May is trying to balance the demands of Brexit supporters such as Johnson against those in her party pushing for a closer relationship with the bloc, who helped inflict a defeat on the government last week in a vote on Brexit legislation.
May, writing in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper, said she won’t be derailed in her strategy and noted she silenced doubters by securing an agreement in the first stage of negotiations. Talks will now begin “immediately” on agreeing the implementation period, she said. This period will be strictly time limited and is likely to last for about two years, she has said previously.
Britain will use the time to keep relations essentially unchanged, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said on Saturday. “We won’t technically or legally be in the customs union or in the single market, but we’re committed, as a result of the agreement we made this week, to creating an environment which will effectively replicate the current status quo,” he said.
That may concern more hardline supporters of Brexit. The U.K. can’t do “proper free trade deals” with other countries if it fails to get an agreement that allows divergence from EU laws, Johnson said, adding he was planning an intervention on the issue this week. The cabinet will next meet on Tuesday.
Barnier, in an 
 with Prospect magazine that was conducted in the days before last week’s summit, reiterated that the EU won’t agree to a more favorable deal with the U.K. than it has with any other countries.
“They have to realize there won’t be any cherry picking,” he said. “We won’t mix up the various scenarios to create a specific one and accommodate their wishes, mixing, for instance, the advantages of the Norwegian model, member of the single market, with the simple requirements of the Canadian one. No way. They have to face the consequences of their own decision.”
Even so, Minister of State for Immigration Brandon Lewis backed May’s position in a Sky News interview, saying last week’s agreement was “something many doubters thought wasn’t possible. She’s delivered on that. We are delivering Brexit.”
In an example of the policy challenges from the split that lie ahead, a parliamentary committee warned that the effectiveness of U.K. sanctions will be 
 post Brexit unless it can quickly agree arrangements for future policy co-operation with the EU. Otherwise, Britain could be left with the choice of imposing less effective unilateral sanctions or aligning with those of the bloc, having no influence over them.

Title: Trump Says U.S. Economy to ‘Rock’ as GOP Races to Tax-Cut Finish - Bloomberg

President Donald Trump predicted the U.S. economy is “going to start to rock” when the Republican 
 of the U.S. tax code is complete after a six-week sprint.
GOP lawmakers posted their sweeping, 503-page 
 -- with permanent tax cut for U.S. corporations and temporary benefits for individuals -- on Friday evening after gaining key votes from two Republican senators who’d threatened to oppose it. Now, with votes planned in the House and Senate by the middle of next week, Trump is closing in on his first major legislative victory.
The bill -- hammered out behind closed doors by Republican leaders -- would slash the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, the lowest that rate has been since 
. It would provide across-the-board tax cuts for most individuals, but then wipe them off the books by 2026. Whether to extend them would be up to a future Congress.
Trump’s White House applauded Friday’s developments, which Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called a major step toward achieving the president’s promises of faster economic growth and “much needed financial relief to all Americans.”
“It’ll be fantastic for the middle-income people and for jobs, most of all,” Trump said on Saturday at the White House before boarding Marine One for Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. He predicted U.S. economic growth “could go to 4, 5 or even 6 percent, ultimately.”
“We are really going to start to rock,” Trump told reporters.
House leaders plan to hold their vote Tuesday. Timing for the Senate vote was less clear, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would “get this bill done” next week.
Trump and congressional Republicans have repeatedly pitched the tax measure as a boon for the middle class, despite independent analyses of earlier versions that said most of the benefit would go to higher earners. The final bill would provide a larger tax cut for the highest earners by 
 the top individual tax rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent, a lower level than was proposed in either the House or Senate versions.
“This April 15 filing season -- that is the last time you will file under this monstrous, broken tax code,” House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said Friday evening. Brady kicked off a remarkably rapid law-making effort on Nov. 2, when he released an initial bill. The final version reflects 
 -- many of them aimed at shoring up GOP votes.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who had announced his opposition to an earlier version of the legislation, switched to “yes” after tax writers changed the bill to broaden the child tax credit’s benefits for working families. Rubio said in a Twitter message that the change “is a solid step toward broader reforms which are both pro-growth and pro-worker.”
Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who hasn’t committed to supporting the final legislation, issued a news release 
 she’d secured “major wins” in it, including provisions that would temporarily broaden an individual deduction for medical expenses and broaden the types of state and local taxes that can be deducted below a $10,000 cap.
Collins also seeks approval of separate legislation that would shore up individual health insurance markets -- where experts say premiums could rise because the tax bill would repeal the Obamacare individual mandate. The Congressional Budget Office has previously estimated that the change would lead to as many as 13 million fewer Americans having health coverage over a decade.
But the most surprising announcement came from Bob Corker of Tennessee -- the only Republican senator who voted against an earlier Senate version of the legislation -- when he said that he’d reversed course and would vote “yes.”
Corker’s concern -- that the legislation would increase federal deficits -- was not addressed in the GOP’s final product. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimated on Friday that the legislation would increase deficits by $1.455 trillion over 10 years, an amount that’s slightly higher than the projection for the version Corker opposed earlier this month.
“This is a bad day to be a deficit hawk,” said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. “While Senator Corker’s decision is disappointing, the entire Republican conference should be against this deficit-financed tax cut,” Ellis said.
McConnell himself had cited deficit concerns earlier this year in discussing tax legislation. “It will have to be revenue-neutral,” he said in an 
 with Bloomberg News. “We have a $21 trillion debt.”
By changing his position, Corker, who’s exchanged bitter remarks with Trump over the president’s personal style, cleared the way for the president’s first real policy victory on Capitol Hill.
Whether it will constitute a political victory remains to be seen. Public opinion polls have shown that earlier versions of the bill were unpopular, but Trump administration officials and GOP leaders predict the tax cuts, once finalized, will gain favor in 2018, ahead of congressional elections.
Democrats -- all of whom voted against earlier versions of the legislation in both chambers -- have decried the rapid, largely secretive process that produced the bill.
“This monstrosity is a bill that only Donald Trump and Republicans, who have accomplished next to nothing in this Congress, could love,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who serves on the tax-writing Ways and Means panel. “It will not grow our economy, it only burdens us with an immense amount of debt.”
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen offered only a 
 of the legislation’s effect on the national economy. “It’s not a gigantic increase in growth,” Yellen said during a news conference.

Title: GOP Delivers Sweeping Plan for Vote Next Week: Tax Debate Update - Bloomberg

Congressional Republicans revealed the final details of their agreed-upon tax-overhaul legislation Friday. It’s the culmination of a six-week legislative sprint designed to deliver a major policy victory for their party and President 
 before year’s end.
For a summary of the bill’s contents, 
.
Here are the latest developments, updated throughout the day:
Republican leaders finalized their plan for a sweeping set of tax cuts for businesses and individuals Friday evening as two key GOP senators backed the plan -- all but guaranteeing a major policy victory for President Donald Trump.
The bill would cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2018 -- and temporarily cut rates for individuals as well. Other temporary changes, which would last through 2025, would boost the standard deduction and child tax credits and modify state and local tax deductions and the mortgage interest deduction.
As a bonus for Republicans, the measure would repeal the individual mandate that requires individuals to purchase insurance -- a measure imposed by the Obamacare law. Repealing that Democratic legislation has been among the party’s long-sought goals.
Congressional budget experts have estimated that repealing the mandate would result in 13 million fewer people having health insurance in 10 years.
Trump’s White House welcomed news of the final tax plan.
“By lowering tax rates, simplifying the rigged and burdensome tax code, and repealing the failed tax on lower- and middle-income households known as the Obamacare individual mandate, this legislation will grow our economy, raise wages, and promote economic competitiveness,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump’s press secretary.
“This April 15 filing season -- that is the last time you will file under this monstrous, broken tax code,” said House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, who will shepherd the final legislation through the House. The House plans to hold that vote Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said in a statement.
“The House and Senate have agreed to a unified tax plan, and we will deliver it to the president’s desk just in time for Christmas,” McCarthy said. The Senate also plans to vote by mid-week.
Senate leaders gained two important votes Friday: GOP senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Bob Corker of Tennessee confirmed they’d vote “yes.” Rubio had sought an enhanced child tax credit -- a change that was made in the final version. Corker, who cited concerns about the bill’s effect on the federal deficit, said he’d had a change of heart.
A preliminary score from Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation showed that the new version of the bill would increase federal deficits by $1.46 trillion over 10 years -- before accounting for any economic growth that might result. Earlier versions of the legislation were estimated to boost deficits by roughly $1 trillion even after such effects.
The agreed-upon plan emerged after a six-week procedural sprint that began when an initial House bill was introduced Nov. 2. As that process unfolded rapidly, Democrats complained that they were shut out of it. They decried it as a tax cut that will mostly benefit high earners and predicted the rapid process would lead to drafting errors or unintended consequences.
Brady said Friday evening that he expects the bill will require technical fixes, but said that’s not unusual.

Republican leaders secured a major victory Friday in their rush to pass sweeping tax cut legislation as GOP Senator Bob Corker said he will support the $1.4 trillion cut.
Lawmakers in the Senate and House plan floor votes next week on a final version of the bill, which would cut tax rates on businesses and individuals. The bill would represent the GOP’s only major policy victory this year -- but a major one for President Donald Trump.
Corker’s unexpected announcement on Friday -- before the final bill was released -- was a major shift from the “no” vote he cast when the Senate considered the legislation on Dec. 2. He cited concerns about the bill’s effect on the federal deficit, and was the only GOP senator to side with Democrats in a 51-49 vote.
Earlier versions of the legislation have been estimated to increase federal deficits by roughly $1 trillion over the coming decade -- even after accounting for economic growth that might result.
Corker said in a statement Friday that he believed the bill, along with regulatory changes and pro-growth trade and immigration policies, could ultimately have a positive impact on Americans.
“I have decided to support the tax reform package we will vote on next week,” Corker said in a statement Friday. “This bill is far from perfect, and left to my own accord, we would have reached bipartisan consensus on legislation that avoided any chance of adding to the deficit and far less would have been done on the individual side with items that do not generate economic growth.”
The White House greeted the news with appreciation. “The President greatly appreciates Senator Corker’s phone call and pledge to support tax cuts,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in an emailed statement. “He sees a great entrepreneurial spirit being released in our country and he is a part of that spirit. When these massive tax cuts and incentives kick in, jobs and growth will follow at a very high level.-- Sahil Kapur
The revised GOP tax plan will slash the income limits at which so-called pass-through businesses can take full advantage of a new deduction.
The bill would only allow pass-through owners who are married and make less than $315,000 (or half that for single taxpayers) to take a 20 percent deduction, according to a document outlining the changes that was obtained by Bloomberg News. The Senate tax bill approved Dec. 2 would have allowed a 23 percent deduction for business income, and phased that deduction out for single taxpayers making more than $250,000 or married couples making more than $500,000.
The tax treatment of pass-throughs, such as partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships, has been one of the main points of contention between the House and Senate. The House tax bill approved last month called for a top rate of 25 percent on pass-throughs’ business income, but placed limits on who could qualify for the rate. Most service professionals were exempted.
The GOP bill will permit all businesses under the income thresholds, regardless of whether they’re service professionals or not, to take advantage of the 20 percent deduction. -- Lynnley Browning and Alexis Leondis
Republican Senator Marco Rubio will support a compromise tax-overhaul package, an aide said -- giving GOP leaders an increased measure of comfort that they’ll score a major legislative victory next week.
Rubio, of Florida, got to “yes” after Senate and House leaders agreed to expand the “refundable” portion of an expanded child tax credit -- effectively giving working-class families a larger share of the benefit. --Anna Edgerton
Republican leaders plan to release a report at 5:30 p.m. on the final tax legislation that they’re preparing for votes next week, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said.
That report will lay out leaders’ plans for reconciling differences between the tax bills that passed the House last month and the Senate on Dec. 2. It’s not yet clear how closely the report will resemble actual legislative text. Lawmakers’ plans call for publishing the full text later.
Some details of the legislation have already emerged; it would set a 21 percent corporate tax rate rate beginning in 2018 -- down from 35 percent. And it would set a top individual income-tax rate of 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent. --Laura Davison
Republican leaders will increase the refundable portion of the child tax credit to $1,400, according to Representative Kristi Noem -- a move that would meet Senator Marco Rubio’s demand that the credit’s refundability increase beyond $1,100.
“We’re in a good spot,” said Noem, one of the House-Senate conference committee participants.
Rubio had emerged as a potential hurdle for the GOP tax bill in recent days, saying he intended to vote against it as written unless the refundable portion of the child tax credit were increased.
Rubio and Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, have proposed expanding the credit to make more of it refundable against payroll taxes, a change that would help more working class families.
“We have not seen bill text, and until we see if the percentage of the refundable credit is significantly higher, then our position remains the same,” Rubio spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said in an email Friday morning.
Republicans have a narrow majority in the Senate, where they passed an initial version of tax legislation with just 51 votes. Losing Rubio’s support would still allow them to pass the final legislation, but would mean that Senate leaders could lose no others, assuming Senator Bob Corker votes “no” again. -- Kaustuv Basu and Sahil Kapur
The Republican tax bill will preserve the estate tax, while temporarily doubling the threshold limits at which the levy kicks in, according to Representative Kristi Noem, one of the House-Senate conference committee tax negotiators.
The change would reduce the number of multimillion-dollar estates that are hit with the 40 percent tax -- before returning to current limits in 2026. Both chambers called for doubling the exemption limits for the tax, but the House bill had called for its full repeal in 2025.
President Donald Trump along with Republicans have promised they would get rid of the levy, which conservatives often refer to as the “death tax.”
The estate tax currently applies a 40 percent tax rate to estates worth more than $5.49 million for single individuals, or $10.98 million for couples.
Noem of South Dakota said she’s disappointed it isn’t being repealed, but happy to see policy is being improved. -- Kaustuv Basu
House and Senate tax negotiators have decided to drop some of the most controversial provisions -- measures related to religion, health care and education -- that were included in the House bill approved last month.
A repeal of the Johnson amendment -- which prohibits tax-exempt nonprofits like churches from supporting or opposing political candidates -- isn’t part of the final tax bill. The House legislation had called for stripping the amendment, a move welcomed by evangelicals, while the Senate bill approved Dec. 2 was silent on the issue.
The conference committee’s move was welcomed by the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Ron Wyden of Oregon.
“I’m pleased to announce that Democrats successfully prevented the repeal of the Johnson Amendment from being jammed into any final Republican tax deal,” Wyden said in a statement. “I will continue to fight all attempts to eliminate this critical provision that keeps the sanctity of our religious institutions intact, prevents the flow of dark money in politics, and keeps taxpayer dollars from advancing special interest biddings.”
Another House provision -- the repeal of medical expense deductions -- has also been dropped from the compromise bill, which is scheduled to be released later Friday. Instead, the final bill will follow the Senate legislation and include a two-year tax extended tax break for individuals with high medical expenses, according to two people familiar with the provision who described it on the condition of anonymity.
The provision lowers the amount people have to spend on health costs before they can deduct those costs, to 7.5 percent of their income, from 10 percent under current law. Its expansion was pushed for by Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican whose vote is crucial to passing the tax package.
The conference report will also call for removing a provision from the House-passed bill to tax higher education tuition waivers, according to two senior congressional aides. The move had sparked outcry from graduate students and their advocates for fear that it would hammer many of them financially. -- Sahil Kapur and Kaustuv Basu
Congressional tax negotiators are hours away from signing a compromise, but two important questions remain: Where’s the money? And do they have the votes?
Changes that have been revealed so far -- many of them sweeteners designed to secure those needed votes -- would probably push the overall tax cut in the plan 
 a $1.5 trillion limit that Congress set earlier this year. But so far, any measures that would help offset the cuts and bring the bill back in line have been closely guarded.
Potential ways to boost revenue -- such as reducing the duration of the planned individual tax cuts so that they’d expire by 2024 -- have been mostly swatted down.
“Never heard that -- don’t know where that’s coming from,” Senator John Thune, the chamber’s No. 3 Republican, said in response to questions about imposing earlier “sunsets” on the individual rate cuts. They’d expire in 2026 under the Senate bill that was approved Dec. 2.
Thune said Thursday that various provisions would offset higher costs of the most recent tweaks to the final bill, but he didn’t specify them.
Sweeteners that have emerged this week -- including cutting the top individual tax rate for the highest earners to 37 percent, from 39.6 percent currently, and broadening the kinds of state and local taxes that would qualify for an individual deduction that’s capped at $10,000 -- are expected to lose an 
 $200 billion or more over 10 years.
GOP leaders may be keeping the so-called spinach under wraps partly because they have only a slim majority in the Senate and want to prevent members of their own party from making additional last-minute demands. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Thursday 
 to vote against the bill unless negotiators boost the child tax credit.
Rubio’s opposition -- along with that of GOP Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who voted against the Senate’s version of the legislation -- would put the bill within one vote of collapse.
Lawmakers appeared to be tweaking the final agreement Thursday to make the numbers work. When Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch was asked about what the so-called pay-fors would be, he responded: “I’m not quite sure what they all are.”
Hatch added that he didn’t know if lawmakers would be able to meet Rubio’s demand. Asked if the Senate could pass the bill without Rubio’s vote, he said, "Probably."
In their compromise legislation, lawmakers have considered setting the corporate rate -- which is currently 35 percent -- at 21 percent instead of 20. That change would allow them to begin the rate cut in 2018 instead of a year later. They are also said to have discussed setting higher-than-planned tax rates -- as high as 15 percent -- on U.S. companies’ stockpiled offshore profit.
But that may not be enough to cover the gap.
Thune and Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio said they’re not discussing moving the date to end individual rate cuts any earlier. Doing so would be politically difficult -- if a future Congress extends the individual cuts, as GOP leaders have promised they would, deficits would almost certainly increase even more. But if they’re not extended, individuals would receive only short-term tax relief while corporations see a permanent rate cut of 14 percentage points.
In addition to Rubio and Corker, the votes of a handful of other GOP senators remain in question.
Mike Lee of Utah is “undecided,” and -- like Rubio -- he’s working to make the child tax credit more generous, according to Conn Carroll, his spokesman.
Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has voiced concerns about tax cuts adding to the deficit, said Thursday he’s undecided as well.
Susan Collins of Maine has voiced opposition to cutting the tax rate for incomes above $1 million and has pushed for passage of two health-care stabilization bills that the House has been cold to. She hasn’t committed to supporting the final tax measure. “I am going to review the tax bill over the weekend,” she said. “There’s lots of rumors about what’s in it, what isn’t.”
There’s also uncertainty around the votes of GOP senators John McCain of Arizona and Thad Cochran of Mississippi. Both have been absent from the Senate this week with health issues, but officials have said both will be able to return for votes next week.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday he’s not sure which chamber will vote first on the final bill. One consideration, he said, was “managing absences in the Senate,” although he didn’t elaborate. -- Sahil Kapur

Title: Elan Ripsticks Are Powerful Skis for Almost Any Type of Powder - Bloomberg

Elan d.o.o., the only major ski manufacturer in Slovenia, was founded in 1945. In 1988 it famously introduced the first pair of hourglass-shaped parabolic skis, which make it easier to turn at low speeds. In 2015 the company reaffirmed its position as an industry innovator by designing the off-piste-friendly, 
 with a designated left and right ski. The inside turning edges of the $800 skis are built with traditional camber construction, providing ample grip on ice, and the tips of the outside edges are bent upward like a rocker for an easier glide through variable snow.
All-mountain skis, meant to perform under a wide variety of conditions, are the largest category on the market. The $799 Nordica Enforcer 100s have a more traditional metal construction, which yields a dampened feel. At $650, the narrow Blizzard Brahmas are adept at making tight turns on groomed trails or between trees. Retailing for $1,150, the handmade, burly Kastle BMX 105 HPs charge hard in open terrain. The Ripstick 96s, with paulownia, poplar, and birch wood cores, fall near the middle of the price range.
On the slopes, the skis are light, easy to maneuver, and extremely forgiving. Even if you’re caught off-balance and in a potentially perilous situation, the carbon tubing along the edges makes it easy to muscle around and regain your line. That said, the Ripsticks have plenty of power. On groomed trails in Utah’s Deer Valley they made clean, racelike arcs; on moguls at nearby Snowbasin they provided plenty of pop in and out of turns; and in Wyoming’s Jackson Hole they were wide enough to float in about a foot of powder. That kind of range gives the skis great value, whether you’re an intermediate or expert.

Title: John McAllister Makes Fantastic Paintings. Who Cares What Museums Think? - Bloomberg

At Miami’s 
, which closed on Dec. 10, the booths are small and the aisles narrow, which means galleries do their utmost to set themselves apart. 
So it was unusual to see paintings by the same artist—John McAllister, a Louisiana-born, Massachusetts-based artist—hung in two separate booths. One, on display at the 
, was on sale for $30,000 and sold in the first two hours of the fair’s opening.
The second, which was 14 feet wide, was at the booth of 
, and by the end of the fair sold for $70,000 to a trustee of the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. 
Most of McAllister’s art doesn’t end up at fairs—but recently you could find it at solo exhibitions in six galleries on two continents: 
 in Brussels, 
 in Berlin, 
 in London, Shane Campbell in Chicago, 
 in Los Angeles, and James Fuentes, who was McAllister’s first dealer, in New York. “I fell in love with the work,” says Fuentes. “Its scale, its luminosity at the time, really grabbed me.”
Beyond dealer representation, McAllister has a devoted group of collectors. In 2009, at a solo show in his Lower East Side gallery, “a couple of key figures came to his opening and got turned on to the work,” says Fuentes. “There were like five people in the room, but among them were [Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. co- founder] Marty Eisenberg, [contemporary artist] Mary Heilmann, [poet and writer] Max Blagg, and [critic and curator] Matthew Higgs.” 
Other collectors of McAllister’s work include the German aristocrat Gloria von Thurn und Taxis and the Puerto Rican art collector César Reyes. 
As opposed to most artists in a similarly anointed position, though, McAllister has garnered all of this goodwill without significant institutional support. Aside from the Rubell Collection in Miami and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, McAllister has been left out of museums’ permanent collections and—with the exception of a few group shows—has largely existed outside of the world of curators and foundations. 
McAllister is therefore an extraordinary anomaly in today’s art market, flying in the face of the conventional wisdom that says emerging artists need the so-called 
 to survive. 
“He hasn’t necessarily gotten the museum support yet, but I think that will come in time,” says Robert Diament, a director at Carl Freedman Gallery. “But it’s an unusual case, definitely. He’s got representation in Brussels, London, it’s unbelievable really, he’s all over the world.” If and when that institutional support comes, his loyal collectors could see an extreme boost in the value of their holdings.
McAllister isn’t exactly an outsider. Born in Louisiana in 1973, he got his MFA at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., in 2007, studying under the superstar artist Mike Kelly, alongside future art-world darlings including Sterling Ruby and Aaron Curry.
But while those artists were all making, to varying degrees, what could be considered conceptual art, McAllister was making paintings. Pretty paintings.
“Just the optimism of the work, in light of the deeply ironic art that was coming out at the time,” says Fuentes. “It made a lot of the other stuff, even work I love, just feel so heavy.”
Initially, McAllister painted wildfires (an unpleasantly precocious, if currently topical subject matter) and made work on a massive scale. After discovering that his art was both prohibitively expensive both to ship and to sell, McAllister scaled down his paintings— which in 2008 were selling for about $7,000— and made smaller, more salable works, turning his attention to landscapes and paintings within paintings.
McAllister met Fuentes shortly after graduating and began to show with him in 2008. After a sold-out show at Fuentes’s gallery in 2009, where paintings were priced at $2,500, McAllister was the subject of a flurry of press and enthusiasm. “We sent out an email with an image [of McAllister’s paintings], and it was the first time since I opened the gallery where the phone was ringing off the hook,” says Fuentes. “We placed every work before the opening of the show.”
Soon after, other galleries began to approach Fuentes about representing McAllister in other regions. In 2013, McAllister had solo shows at the Richard Telles gallery in Los Angeles, the Carl Freedman Gallery in London, and the Shane Campbell Gallery in Chicago. “The first show we did was really great,” says Diament, of the London gallery. “We had six small canvases, and they sold out immediately. It wasn’t because he had a big name, it was because people connected with the work.”
The next year he had another solo show in London and one in New York; in 2015 he had yet another solo show in New York and branched out to Hagiwara Projects, a gallery in Tokyo. In 2016 he had solo shows in Brussels and Berlin, while this year he had yet another show in London.
Despite all that, there isn’t the typical market frenzy surrounding McAllister’s work that would lead most collectors to fear they’re buying into a bubble.
His art sells for about $20,000 for a small painting, $30,000 for a midsize work, and $70,000 for a massive piece. Despite the sold-out shows of yore, his art has never once sold at auction, and his collectors rarely ask Fuentes to resell their works. “All the resales, for the most part, have come back to me,” Fuentes says. “And we’ve done a total of 10 or so over the last 10 years. People aren’t really letting them go.” Currently, he says, there are works available for purchase, which means supply is meeting though not eclipsing demand.
“We don’t want to push his prices to a crazy place,” he says. “Once you inch past $75,000 and get to $100,000, it seems like it’s pushing it.
“I would say maybe once an institutional response comes around,” Fuentes continues, “then maybe such a price would be warranted.”

Title: Big Banks Would Benefit from the Tax Bill — After an Initial Hit - Bloomberg

The Republican tax bill is good news for big banks. At least, it will be once the initial pain wears off.
 expects a fourth-quarter “adjustment” of as much as $2 billion largely driven by the firm’s unremitted overseas earnings facing taxation, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Tuesday at an investor conference. Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said his firm would also take a hit, having to decrease the value of its 
.
“If something gets enacted this year, there would be an adjustment in the fourth quarter; for us, that would be negative and not small,” Lake said. “But as you move forward, depending on when the tax cut comes in, we would benefit from the lower rate.”
The proposed bill was a big topic at the year’s last major banking conference, and executives were more positive on the long-term effects of the bill -- both for them and their clients. Wells Fargo & Co. CEO Tim Sloan said the changes could add another half a percent to gross domestic product, while Moynihan said corporate clients are telling the bank they’ve been waiting for certainty on tax changes so they can decide on long-term capital expenditure plans.
“It will unleash some activity, no question,” Moynihan said of the tax plan. “It’s good for corporate America, and it’s good for us.”
Investors have been driving up U.S. bank shares over the last year in anticipation of policy and regulatory changes expected from Donald Trump and his Republican allies. The nation’s two largest banks -- JPMorgan and Bank of America -- have each jumped more than 50 percent since Trump’s election, surpassing both the KBW Bank Index’s 43 percent rise and a 24 percent gain for the S&P 500 Index.
While Moynihan noted that lenders would no longer be able to deduct as much of what they pay in premiums to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Lake said that the lower corporate tax rate -- whether it ends up at 20 percent or 22 percent -- will outweigh any loss of deductions for her company.

Title: Best Cocktail Bars in Singapore and What to Order at Them - Bloomberg

For a place that’s known to be quite conservative, Singapore offers cocktails that have a tendency to make your heart race. In just one recent week of drinking across town, I sipped a rum-yogurt cocktail that included two kinds of Southeast Asian ants; ordered off a “menu” that was a bag of gummy bears custom-flavored to mimic each drink; and tasted a flight of “natural wines” fermented from fig and pear, tomato, and cabbage. And that’s not to mention the tall drink with “performance-enhancing drugs,” which turned out to be a rose aperitif with pink dragon fruit, basil seeds, and a Malaysian virility bark called 
  
To call this bar world creative would be a wild understatement. Shaking off its reputation as a staid, workaholic city-state, Singapore has exploded onto the cocktail scene as one of the world’s premiere bar cities. In October it took six spots in this year’s “
” list, third only to perennial cocktail capitals London (with eight ) and New York (seven).  
Ranked the highest in Singapore is the opulent hotel bar 
(No. 7 on the list), with what must be the world’s most ambitious barrel-aging system; then there’s 
 (No.  15), a soaring, art deco-inspired space with exquisite martinis and a 1,000-bottle gin tower. They represent only a sliver of the remarkably diverse cocktail culture that’s sprung up within a three-mile radius in the unlikeliest of places. 
Just five or six years ago, you’d be hard-pressed to say Singapore had a cocktail culture at all. Sure, there was the Singapore Sling, invented at the famously peanut-strewn Long Bar at the 
—but that was it. Modern mixology? That required a trip abroad.
Husband-and-wife team Indra Kantono and Gan Guoyi remember being met with raised eyebrows when they opened one of the city’s original craft cocktail bars, 
, in 2012. “Is this really safe at night?” Guoyi remembers her parents asking, referring not only to the bar business but also her choice of neighborhood. Amoy Street, on the outskirts of Chinatown, is now home to four of the most highly regarded bars in the city—Jigger & Pony included. 
Kantono says Singapore’s rise as a cocktail capital is a direct result of nothing being there before. He describes the city as an empty canvas. “We don't have a century-old love affair with wines, or with whiskies, or anything at all,” says Kantono, who, with Guoyi, now runs five establishments, with another on the way. “In New York there are expectations for what a cocktail bar is. Here it’s kind of a blank slate.” 
Steven Mason, general manager at the double-Michelin-starred 
, echoed the same notion. “Nothing is produced here, which means you have no ties with anyone,” he said. “That can be a wonderful thing.” 
Singapore is a truly international city, with a constant influx of foreigners as well as locals who tend to work or study abroad. Having picked up a taste for craft cocktails abroad, they now seek them back at home. “People really like new experiences in Singapore,” Kantono says. “They expect something they haven’t tried before.”
Of course, wealth is the underpinning to all this. A world capital of finance and trade, Singapore is home to residents and expats with money to spend and more and more tourists ready to do the same. 
Enter 
, one of New York’s most highly regarded cocktail bars, which opened a Singapore branch in 2016. Co-founder Igor Hadzismajlovic says the city’s “diverse expat community of people who love to eat and drink” is what sold him on the destination. “We were confident we would have an audience there,” he explains.  
A sense of energy and experimentation underpins the whole of Singapore’s drinking scene. At 
, perhaps my favorite bar of the Jigger & Pony group, I sipped a gin-honey-lemon concoction I was told would make me feel like a hummingbird—it arrived suspended in a glass bulb with a profusion of flora and an abnormally short straw, such that I had to bury my nose into the drink. (Birdlike, indeed!) At the recklessly creative 
, a rum and salted egg yolk cocktail is smoked in hay; at 
, there’s an unrivaled dedication to Southeast Asian spirits and ingredients, including the aforementioned ants. And these bars are just the beginning. 
Even wine bars are pushing international boundaries. At 
, with its artfully unfinished look and exploratory wine selection, you can drink cult favorites such as the sparkling wines of the Loire’s Domaine Mosse or a light, dynamic red Poulsard from the Jura—a list that would be a sommelier favorite anywhere in New York or Los Angeles. 
 is the newest venue from Proof & Co., a group that runs several Singapore bars and consults on other ambitious ventures in town. More significant, it acts as an importer for a remarkable array of boozy products and also trains bartenders on how to use them.
Case in point: One Saturday night, Kantono, the pioneer barman, led me to the group’s latest project. In a space they call Junior—an unmarked, 10-seat bar tucked behind Crackerjack—they’ve opened a six-month pop-up dubbed 
. (Each pop-up at Junior has a different name.) Norma is an ode to agave, with drinks that focus on tequila, mezcal, and even lesser-known bottlings of 
an herbaceous and earthy cousin to mezcal that rarely makes it out of Oaxaca.
“No one in Singapore was asking for an agave bar,” says Kantono, sipping a mezcal cocktail from a skull mug, surrounded by a crowd of restaurant industry drinkers. “No one here goes to Mexico, no one knows what mezcal is. But there’s a sense of screw it, let’s try it. This is supply-led. It’s not demand-led.”
  The pioneer is still a thriving, friendly scene. 
Try any of the legendary punch bowls.
 This upbeat rum bar is next door to Jigger. 
The Sugarhall Daiquiri, made with 15-year Trinidad rum, is garnished with a caviar-topped banana chip.
 Sophisticated and innovative, it has a room dedicated to aging drinks that includes more than 100 barrels. 
 Do as locals do. Get the Solera-aged Negroni for yourself and a bowl of punch to share.
 A breathtaking place to sip a martini, this soaring art deco atrium has unparalleled gin and Champagne lists. 
What else? James Bond’s drink of choice.
 Dark and sexy and speakeasy-style, this place has no pretensions of passwords or hidden doors. 
The deceptively complex Stone Fence, with Appleton 12-year rum, pear liqueur, and cider, is a favorite.  
 One of the oldest yet most experimental bars on the Singapore scene, it currently has a gummy bear menu.
  Success is made with red wine, amaro, Cognac, and whiskey. (Now you know.)
Through a barely marked door and down an industrial staircase, you’ll find a wildly experimental cocktail den with boundless creative energy. 
The Egg is a profoundly rich rum-salted egg yolk concoction, or try one of their house-fermented “natural wines.” 
 An effortlessly classy establishment, it has charismatic bartenders to boot. 
The Botanic Gardens  will legitimately make you feel like a hummingbird. 
 A stripped-down modern wine bar, it features  a wall display of wines rather than a more traditional list. 
 Ask anyone on staff for an offbeat recommendation. 
This bar is deeply devoted to sustainability and Southeast Asian ingredients. 
The Antz is both the must-order novelty and a beautifully composed cocktail. 
 Features pulled from the New York original include charming bartenders, expertly made cocktails, and chicken soup served at last call. 
The Ready, Fire, Aim—it’s mezcal-based. 
 The all-day cafe-bar-restaurant is remarkably friendly and affordable. 
 The Ballgame is inspired by American baseball and tastes like bourbon and caramel corn, with a little beer back. 
 This 10-seat bar behind Crackerjack carries a phenomenal tequila and mezcal selection. 
Try whatever the bartenders offer you. 
 The charmingly dive-y bar on Boat Quay is best avoided if you have morning plans. 
 Go for anything but the Shitty American Beer, unless that’s your thing.

Title: How You Can Exploit the Tax Bill Right Now - Bloomberg

At the end of every year, millions of Americans can make strategic moves to shave a few bucks off their April tax bill. Right now, millions more should be able to get into the act, with Congressional Republicans poised to pass a 503-page law that fundamentally restructures the U.S. tax code.
If the bill passes, new tax rates and countless other provisions would go into effect on Jan. 1. Most of the old rules though would still apply in the last two weeks of 2017—and that gives individuals a shrinking window of time to employ strategies that would lower their taxes for next year’s tax season. (While the legislation would take effect in the new year, it won’t be reflected in your tax forms until the 2019 tax season).
So, here are suggestions from accountants, financial planners, and other tax experts on how to make the most of this opportunity. Keep in mind that the best advice depends specifically on how you’re going to be affected by the tax bill. While most Americans would get a tax cut in the short term, some taxpayers could see higher tax bills in 2018. “No individual is average,” Suzanne Shier, a tax strategist at Northern Trust Corp., reminds us. “An average is a composite of multiple individuals.”
If your taxes are set to spike in 2018, many of these strategies won’t work as well. But if you’re part of the majority who will see an initial tax benefit from the law, there could be big benefits for acting soon.
A typical piece of end-of-the-year advice is to increase your potential deductions before Jan. 1. Deductions claimed for things you did this year will lower tax bills due the following April. Wait until January, and you’ll need to cool your heels for more than a year to get the benefit of deductions claimed.
This year, beefing up your charitable giving could be even more effective. If your tax rate is falling in 2018, your deductions are more valuable if claimed against this year’s income. Giving to charity, a tax deduction that’s preserved under the tax bill, is an effective way to boost your 2017 deductions on short notice.
And even if your tax rate is going up next year under the new bill, you may still want to make a bunch of charitable donations in 2017. Most deductions, including the charitable one, can only be claimed if you itemize your tax return. The bill would sharply limit the number of taxpayers who would benefit from itemizing: First it raises the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for single people, and $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. Second, it limits other deductions—most famously for state and local taxes—so it’s harder for taxpayers to reach the threshold where itemizing makes sense.
So, you might want to think about making several years of charitable donations this month if you can afford it, said Philip “Rusty” Ross, a financial adviser at Exencial Wealth Advisors based in Oklahoma City. If you’re not sure where to donate, you can open a donor-advised fund and decide later where your money will go. But move fast—there are only two weeks left in December.
Another traditional recommendation for this time of year is to defer income. While salaried workers generally can’t choose when they get paid, business owners can often delay registering income until the following year, lowering their April tax bill in the process. Investors can also control their taxable income—and thus lower capital gains tax bills—by selling losing stocks or waiting to sell winning stocks until 2018. In most years, deferring income merely delays the taxes you will have to pay eventually. But, if you expect your tax rate to fall next year, deferring income into 2018 could actually save you money. (There’s also some good news for equity investors 
.)
As we noted, the tax bill would limit how much state and local taxes (or SALT) individuals can deduct, to no more than $10,000 of a combination of property taxes and either income or sales taxes. The move by the Republican-controlled Congress was criticized by Democrats as an effort to make citizens of high-tax blue states pay for benefits to corporations and citizens of low-tax red states. As a result, advisers had been planning to instruct clients targeted by this provision to find ways to maximize their SALT deduction in 2017, by pre-paying next year’s taxes as much as allowed and deducting them under the old rules. But the final compromise bill, unveiled Friday by Republicans in the Senate and House, explicitly closes this loophole with respect to income taxes. Any 2018 state and local income taxes paid ahead of time would nevertheless need to be counted on next year’s taxes, according to the bill. However, taxpayers could still pre-pay property taxes due in 2018, and deduct them under the old rules. Additionally, any taxes due for 2017—or any late taxes from previous years—could still be deducted on a tax return due this April.
Current tax law allows employees to deduct unreimbursed expenses related to their jobs as long as they’re more than 2 percent of income. The tax bill ends these itemized deductions after the end of this year. So, workers should think about whether they can pay —and get the receipts—for as many of these expenses as possible this month, said Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block in Kansas City, Missouri. Examples of unreimbursed expenses for employees might include tools and supplies, occupational taxes, work uniforms, union dues, and expenses for work-related travel. Self-employed people and business owners would still be able to deduct expenses under the new tax bill. 
Under the proposed law, you’ll no longer be allowed to deduct work-related moving expenses after the new year (unless you’re in the military). Of course it might be difficult to schedule a cross-country move on such short notice, but, “if you did move, make sure you clear up any moving-related expenses by Dec. 31,” said Fordham University accounting and taxation professor Stanley Veliotis. And if your destination happens to be a low-tax red state, maybe thank Santa Claus for your good luck.

Title: This Painter Just Went From ‘Up and Coming’ to Investment-Worthy - Bloomberg

The more people willing to buy a work, the more convincing the argument that the work is here to stay. When that artist’s pieces begin to find a new life in the secondary market, the more you can be sure that his or her work is a good investment.
After taking stock of last month’s contemporary auctions, anyone could look to the market of London-born Lynette Yiadom-Boakye and reasonably conclude that her work has crossed over, in market terms, from “up and coming” to something more significant.
Over two days, three of the painter’s lush oil paintings depicting fictional black characters came to auction at Sotheby’s. One, 
, 2011, which is more than eight feet wide and depicts a group of dancers dressed in white, was estimated to sell for $250,000 to $350,000. It sold for $1.575 million.
The next day, two more came on the block at Sotheby’s. The first, estimated between $80,000 and $120,00, sold for just under $340,000, while the second, estimated between $100,000 and $150,000, sold for $118,750.
“Only five or six years ago you could still buy one of these canvases for less than 10,000 pounds [$13,476], says Hannah O’Leary, the head of Sotheby’s modern and contemporary African Art department, a division that was created last year. “Certainly, in the last 12 to 24 months, we’ve had a surge of people desperate to acquire her pieces.”
Call it a market trend or call it simply a long-overdue recognition of heretofore overlooked artists, but Yiadom-Boakye, who was born in 1977, joins a select group of peers from the African diaspora, including Njideka Akunyili Crosby and Kerry James Marshall, whose paintings have recently surged past $1 million at auction.
“She’s a great artist, first of all,” says O’Leary. “But the fact that she is a woman, she is black, she is of the African diaspora—these are all things that the [art] market is turning toward.”
It’s not as if Yiadom-Boakye has been hiding or is unknown to many in the art world since she graduated from the Royal Academy in London’s MFA program in 2003.
While her style has evolved over the past 10 years, Yiadom-Boakye has consistently painted large-scale oil portraits of people she paints from her imagination. Drawing on established stylistic precedents—Manet and Goya are often evoked—she developed a distinct aesthetic with deep, saturated colors and dynamic figures. 
“She’s an extraordinary painter,” says Tamsen Greene, a senior director at New York’s Jack Shainman gallery, which has represented Yiadom-Boakye since 2009. “She’s made her own, unique style, but she uses this classic, incredibly formal visual language that draws people in.”
By 2007, Yiadom-Boakye had been included in an array of group shows, including the Tate Liverpool Biennial and the Saatchi Gallery’s Triumph of Painting Part 6, and in 2010 the Studio Museum in Harlem gave her a critically acclaimed solo show. She’s since been a subject of solo shows at the Serpentine Gallery in London (2015), the Kunsthalle Basel (2017), and the 
 in New York (2017).
“Since the day we’ve started working with her, there’s been a great deal of demand,” says Greene. “We’ve always had to manage a wait list.”
That could partially be due to Yiadom-Boakye’s core group of prominent collectors, who have been vocal supporters of her career by lending her work to exhibitions whenever possible.
Those collectors include former NBA player Elliot Perry and his wife Kimberly, the German hair-care heir Thomas Olbricht, the Belgian collecting couple Wilfried and Yannicke Cooreman, the Japanese industrialist Hiroshi Taguchi, and the American philanthropist and collector Pamela Joyner.
“The people who live with her work love it,” says Greene. “It’s not rare that someone acquires a work and then immediately wants to acquire another one.”
For all that, it took nearly a decade for a single painting by Yiadom-Boakye to come up to auction, when her work 
, which was made in 2005, was put on sale at Sotheby’s in London in 2010 with an estimate of 15,000 to 20,000 pounds. It sold for 52,500 pounds with premium.
The next day at Christie’s London, another one of her paintings sold for 146,000 pounds above a high estimate of 50,000 pounds, and the day after that, also at Christie’s London, another painting sold for 116,553 pounds over a high estimate of 15,000 pounds. 
“We, along with her London gallery, do everything we can to place her work in collections that are going to be good stewards,” says Greene. “A lot of the works that go to auction predate her work with either of her galleries.” (The three works that came to Sotheby’s in November were from the estate of the collector Jerome Stern, who died in April.)
O’Leary credits Yiadom-Boakye’s secondary-market breakthrough to the New Museum show earlier this year. “She was really in the London auctions,” she says. “But we can attribute a lot of her success to her newly raised profile in the U.S.”
The inevitable question—whether her new status in the art market can be sustained—has already been answered, Greene says. “She’s not a new artist. She’s had important solo shows, and I don’t see why that would change,” she says.
“I think all the market frenzy is just a testament to the work.”

Title: ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ Reaps $105 Million in Friday Opening - Bloomberg

’s latest “Star Wars” film is on track to post the second-biggest box office one-day takings on record, behind only its predecessor in the space saga.
Sales for “The Last Jedi” were estimated at $104.8 million on Friday, Disney said in an emailed statement. That would make it just the second film to pass $100 million in a single day behind “The Force Awakens.”
The earlier movie holds the record for single-day revenue thanks to pent-up demand, since it was the first film in the series in a decade.
“The Last Jedi” has been opening worldwide this week with the exception of China, where it debuts Jan. 5. The takings are ahead of Disney’s expectations: It initially estimated the movie would reap $99 million to $104 million on Friday.
In a previous forecast, Disney expected the new film to rake in $195 million to $215 million in its first three days. “The Force Awakens” holds the current record for opening-weekend sales outside the U.S. with $281 million.

Title: Disney Keeps Options Open for Sky in $52.4 Billion Fox Deal - Bloomberg

 is keeping its options open regarding European broadcaster 
.
Disney is seeking to absorb the British pay-TV company as part of its $52.4 billion purchase of assets from 21st Century Fox Inc., 
. The deal assumes Fox, which owns 39 percent of Sky, will win U.K. approval first for its bid for the rest of the satellite provider.
Should Disney get only Fox’s existing Sky stake, the Burbank, California-based entertainment giant doesn’t believe it’s obligated to make an offer for the rest of the broadcaster, according to the U.K. Takeover Panel, a British authority.
That clouds the outlook for Sky shareholders, who’ve watched as the 11.7 billion ($15.7 billion) takeover from 
’s Fox has been threatened by a rare and extensive review in the U.K., where critics have aired concerns about the 2011 phone-hacking scandal at his newspapers and harassment allegations at Fox News.
“It’s not the slam-dunk view for Sky,” said Alex DeGroote, media analyst at Cenkos Securities. “Your working assumption would be that it’s job done, 100 percent, no problem. That doesn’t appear to be the case based on what Disney are saying there.”
Disney said it will assume full ownership of Sky, including its outstanding debt, if Fox completes the takeover before the deal with Disney is final. Fox said it remains committed to completing the Sky offer and anticipates the deal to be done by June 30, subject to approval.
If U.K. regulators block the deal, “the existing shares in Sky will still go to Disney,” Murdoch said on a call with analysts. “It’ll be up to them what to do.”
Shares of Sky, Britain’s biggest pay-TV network, 
 1.9 percent to 990 pence at the market close in London, valuing the company at 17 billion pounds.
Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger called Sky a “crown jewel” among Fox assets in an interview with Jonathan Ferro on Bloomberg TV and said he hopes Fox is successful acquiring Sky. “We certainly would be looking forward to having the opportunity to have Sky be part of our company.”
The Takeover Panel said it will make an announcement regarding its view on whether Disney has an obligation to make a full bid for Sky “in due course,” and will seek the views of Sky’s independent directors before making a decision.
Disney is relying on the so-called chain principle in the panel’s rules, by indirectly acquiring the stake through Fox. It would need to show that the Sky stake isn’t a significant part of the Fox assets it’s acquiring or that controlling Sky wasn’t a significant purpose for its purchase.
The likelihood of Disney eventually owning Sky may help persuade the U.K. government to approve Fox’s bid, with the knowledge it would end up in the hands of an owner less encumbered by sometimes controversial ties to the country.
Murdoch’s critics welcomed the prospect of Disney owning Sky, as a way to reduce the media baron’s influence in Britain. Murdoch’s News Corp. already owns the Sun, the Times of London and the Sunday Times newspapers.
“It removes a major worry that we would have excessive concentration of media ownership,” said Vince Cable, the leader of the opposition Liberal Democrat party.

Title: In Puerto Rico and the BVI, Cruises Spark First Signs of Tourism Recovery - Bloomberg

Almost three months after Hurricane Maria 
 as a nearly Category 5 storm, a third of the island is still without power. Roughly two-thirds of its 45,000 small businesses suffered closures, with 
 planning never to reopen their doors. Just 129 miles away, the British Virgin Islands has begun to shift 
 following earlier devastation by Hurricane Irma, with cleanups still under way on land and along coastlines.
But in recent weeks, a beacon of hope has arrived on each destination’s harbor: cruise ships. With no real need for on-land infrastructure, the first three vessels to pull into Tortola and Virgin Gorda since Irma—the 62-passenger 
, the 112-passenger 
, and the 2,076-passenger 
—dropped anchor in the first two weeks of December. The BVI’s most prominent yacht companies, Sunsail Ltd. and the Moorings, also restored their charter services on Dec. 9.
Meanwhile, in Old San Juan, a welcoming celebration was held on Nov. 30 as a reminder—to locals and the first 7,000-odd, post-storm cruisers—that Puerto Ricans are proficient in both willpower and complex rhythms. Following that day’s twin arrivals of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.’s 
 and Carnival Corp.’s 
, the port has resumed its full cruise operations, with regular calls from more than 10 companies, from Norwegian to Viking to Celebrity Cruises.
For San Juan residents, this is a milestone worth celebrating. “If there is something that distinguishes Puerto Ricans, it’s our spirit of hospitality,” said Carla Campos, deputy director and chief marketing officer of Puerto Rico Tourism Co. And celebrate they will: From now until the end of January, locals will continue to party for every cruise that arrives in San Juan. “Everyone that’s arriving via these cruise calls will see music and traditional performances on the streets,” Campos said. “All the shops are open. Businesspeople are putting together specials and decorating.”
Campos expects cruises to have a total economic impact of about $25 million in November and December. That figure represents 58 cruise arrivals and 110,000-plus visitors—numbers that don’t deviate significantly from Puerto Rico’s norm, she said. That the industry has sprung back so quickly, and with such full force, is no accident.
“We’ve personally hosted top-level executives from each cruise line to allow them to see firsthand the resiliency of our services and infrastructure, and that has allowed us to resume our calendar of operations intact,” explained Campos.
In financially downtrodden Puerto Rico—which was on the brink of bankruptcy before the storms—tourism has always been an economic silver lining, accounting for as much as 15 percent of gross domestic product. In the British Virgin Islands that figure shoots to as high as 30 percent. But there, a different story is unfolding.
“The cruise pier is operational and able to receive ships,” said Sharon Flax-Brutus, the BVI’s director of tourism, “but we’re not accepting larger ships to our destination—ones that are 4,000-plus passengers—until we can rebuild more of our infrastructure.”
Flax-Brutus’s office estimates that cruise passengers spend an average of $89 onshore—a number that, while not extravagant, added up to $45 million in 2015. That can go a long way for communities in Tortola and Virgin Gorda that have lost everything from their homes to their full-time employment. But there’s a catch: “We’ve built a brand equity and brand loyalty for the BVI as a luxury destination,” Flax-Brutus said, “and we want visitors to return when we are proud of what we have to offer.”
She’s not the only one worried that short-term gains might imperil a full, long-term tourism recovery. “We have a standard that we have to uphold in this territory of the Virgin Islands,” government representative Melvin Turnbull 
 last week, “and it must not be dumbed down that we have to say that we are opened for business and we are ready to receive people when in fact that we are not.”
If reputation is at risk, so is morale—and a local workforce that could decamp to greener pastures if they can’t find employment again soon. That’s why David Johnson, whose Victor International Corp. developed 
 on Virgin Gorda, is racing to reopen the resort on Dec. 16. “People need to come back,” he said. “The locals want them to come back, they need them to come back … that’s their lifeline.”
“When we reopen, we’ll have 65 staff permanently employed and 200 contractors,” he added. That’s an encouraging first step for a country where 34.5 percent of the workforce is directly employed by tourism. As for the impact of each new cruise, each hotel reopening, each restaurant flipping over its “closed” sign? “Every one of these milestones is absolutely critical,” he said.
Cruise ships won’t call on destinations that aren’t well-equipped to receive their passengers safely, which is why, until now, travelers have seen alternative ports on their itineraries. For many travelers, cancellations aren’t the answer: Most companies charge penalties or fees to reschedule sailings or offer only partial refunds.
“Having just been in San Juan in late spring, I wasn’t sure what I would see when I arrived there earlier this month,” said Steve Simao, 
’ director of sales, who visited aboard the 
. “Did I see a city and an island in recovery? Yes. I didn’t see devastation. Mostly what I saw was life.”
Meaning street life—in San Juan, stores and restaurants are open. Signs of lingering damage include nonoperational traffic lights, electricians working on poles and wires along the streets, and buzzing generators.
This month, three of Windstar’s small-ship cruises will leave from the Puerto Rican port, taking with them a total of 608 passengers.
Although few cruise companies are proactively offering excursions that allow travelers to contribute to the recovery, Puerto Rico Tourism is making it easy for those who want to help. “We rolled out a meaningful travel program that takes travelers to attractions that still need a little more cleanup—some great beaches, the Camuy cave system, that sort of thing,” said the tourism company’s Campos. This way, she explained, travelers can see the island’s most beautiful corners while rehabbing them for future generations.
In the BVI, recovery is taking longer, and efforts aren’t as centralized. 
 is open for divers and snorkelers; restaurants on Tortola, Virgin Gorda, and Jost Van Dyke are steadily reopening; the iconic, boulder-lined trails at 
 have been reengineered and made safe for visitors; and several beaches are back to their sandy status quo. That offers plenty of activities for day-trippers coming off cruise ships. It also puts excursion managers and tour operators back in business.
A grass-roots energy is also helping. Notably, locals are setting up “pop-ups” in tents on the beach to bring a beach party vibe to once-popular areas such as Cane Garden Bay, where brick-and-mortar establishments have yet to reopen.
“We’re adding music, too,” said Flax-Brutus, the tourism director. “We’re working with local vendors in the neighborhoods—we’re trying to do the best thing for everybody.”
In both Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands, there’s plenty of uphill climbing left to do. Roads need to be rebuilt. Trees need to be cleared. Crucially, more hospitals and schools need to reopen.
Oil Nut Bay’s Johnson says it will likely be a full year before his fellow luxury hoteliers can start taking reservations again; in Puerto Rico, the lush islands of Vieques and Culebra are waiting to celebrate their own comebacks in the coming weeks and months.
“Mother Nature needs time to heal,” explained Campos. “Hopefully towards the end of 2018 we can see the El Yunque rainforest open again for visitors,” she added. Top-tier resorts like Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, will also remain closed for renovations until next fall.
But optimism is in the air. Said prominent Puerto Rican chef 
: “People are going out and having fun—struggle shakes things up, I believe. You can see nightlife coming back, everybody that comes in the restaurant is extremely happy that we are open, and this ends up creating such a feel-good vibe.”
Campos sees an additional silver lining. “Now that we’ve been in the headlines for so long, travelers know more about us,” she said. “Maybe we weren’t on their radar before, and now we are.” Her Puerto Rican pride was palpable. “Yeah, we got hard hit, but now we’re back up and running. And since you’ve been watching, the best way to help is to come and see us for yourself.”

Title: China's Top Phone Makers Poised to Challenge Apple on Home Turf - Bloomberg

China’s top smartphone makers are ready to challenge Apple Inc. on its home turf after trouncing the iPhone maker in their own market.
 and 
 are in talks with U.S. wireless operators about selling flagship smartphones to American consumers as soon as next year, according to people familiar with the matter. The handset makers are negotiating with carriers including AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Talks are still fluid and it’s possible no agreements will materialize, they said.
Apple has a lot at stake in the U.S., where it is the leading smartphone maker. In years past, it’s been insulated from competition by strong support from carriers, which used to subsidize its expensive iPhones and lowered the upfront price for customers. These subsidies or discounts have gone away, as carriers moved to phone financing that spreads costs over two years.
Huawei has already tried selling its flagship Mate 9 phone in the U.S. via e-commerce websites like Amazon.com, but working directly with wireless partners would give China’s No. 1 phone maker a wider presence across the U.S. through retail stores, carrier websites and TV commercials. Huawei is in talks to sell a flagship line via U.S. carriers, but the Chinese company also plans to sell the Mate 10 device through e-commerce channels, the people said.
Xiaomi executive Wang Xiang said the firm aims to roll out phones in the U.S. within two years, but noted that the process of working through specifications with each carrier is time consuming. Xiaomi is also weighing opening retail stores in the U.S. to build its brand and sell its fitness trackers, thermostats and vacuum cleaners before a phone launch, he said. Those products are already sold online in the U.S. Verizon, AT&T and Huawei declined to comment.
The Chinese handset makers are targeting the U.S. market at an opportune time. U.S. carriers are cutting subsidies so consumers increasingly pay full price, in some cases more than $1,000, for high-end phones. Chinese rivals often sell phones far cheaper. Huawei’s Mate 9 was on sale on Amazon.com for $400 on Thursday.
The U.S. phone market is dominated by Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. Since most phones are purchased through carriers, it’s nearly impossible for a manufacturer to gain serious market share without support from AT&T or Verizon, the two largest U.S. wireless networks.
The telecom companies have supported challengers. Verizon sells Google Pixel phones, and Sprint offers Andy Rubin’s Essential handset exclusively. 
, another Chinese phone maker and thus far one of the most successful in the U.S., sells its dual-screen Axon model in the U.S. via a deal with AT&T.
Apple considers China one of its most important markets, yet sales have fallen there in recent years. Apple shipped 8.8 million iPhones in the third quarter in China, ranking behind Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, IDC 
 last month. That gives Apple just under 8 percent of the Chinese smartphone market, compared with just over 33 percent for Huawei and Xiaomi combined, according to IDC’s report.
Still, that represents some improvement. Apple saw six successive quarters of iPhone sales declines in China before the third quarter, when it had a 40 percent year-over-year increase, according to research firm Canalys.
Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive officer, 
China’s World Internet Conference in Wuzhen this month for the first time, emphasizing the importance of the market.
Still, some analysts are 
 that Apple’s rebound can last. Though it introduced its 10th-anniversary iPhone X recently, the $1,000 device costs a lot more than most rivals.
“Apple’s growth this quarter is only temporary,” said Mo Jia, an analyst with researcher Canalys, said. “The hefty price of iPhone X is going to hurt sales in China.”

Title: Disney Is About to Become the ‘Walmart of Hollywood’ - Bloomberg

’s deal with 
 will transform Hollywood’s most successful studio into an even more powerful force, potentially pressuring rivals to consolidate, squeezing theater chains and furthering the industry trend of blockbusters and sequels.
Disney will 
 Fox’s studio, cable channels such as FX and National Geographic, and international assets in a deal valued at $52.4 billion, the companies said Thursday. The deal can be completed in 12 to 18 months if regulators approve it, Disney said.
“Disney is becoming the Walmart of Hollywood: huge and dominant,” said Barton Crockett, a media analyst at B. Riley FBR. “That’s going to have a big influence up and down the supply chain.”
This is the first major consolidation in Hollywood since 
 swallowed Universal Pictures in 2011. With Fox and Disney under one corporate roof, the top six studios will shrink to five. 
Comcast, which bought DreamWorks Animation last year, may feel it must buy another studio to stay competitive. Meanwhile, smaller independent studios, like Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, or larger entities such as 
’s Paramount Pictures, could face more pressure to sell.
Getting bigger would give studios more content and intellectual property, while cutting costs, helping them create movies that dominate the weekend box office, Crockett said.
Fox would give Disney even more leverage in negotiations with theater chains, like 
, which have been undergoing their own wave of consolidation. Disney asked some theaters for a greater share of ticket sales for big films like “Star Wars,” according to a person familiar with the situation. Usually the revenue is evenly split but on very popular films, Disney can claim more than 60 percent.
Disney could try the same tactic again with Fox’s popular film franchises like “Avatar,” which has four big-budget sequels in the works. Disney and Fox combined for 40 percent of ticket sales in 2016 in the U.S and Canada, 
 to researcher Box Office Mojo.
“We would expect Disney’s increased scale to be a meaningful negative to exhibitors,” Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, wrote in a note Wednesday. AMC shares are down more than 50 percent so far this year.
A Disney-Fox tie-up would follow years of growing concentration at the box office, with most ticket sales going to a smaller number of movies. Last year, the top 10 films accounted for 34 percent of the total, up from a historical average of about 28 percent, according to Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen & Co.
One looming question is whether Disney will distribute any movies under the Fox label, or increase its output at all. So far, Disney’s strategy has been to narrow the number and type of movies it makes to focus on big-budget, family-friendly franchises. Fox has put out 22 flicks so far this year. Disney has distributed just seven, yet still may end the year with the highest box-office sales of any studio with the latest “Star Wars” opening this week.
Disney could scale back the slate of indie dramas at Fox’s Searchlight studio in favor of even more blockbusters with sequels, merchandise and theme park attractions. That could leave less room at theaters for “smaller specialty stuff” and independent players like A24, which distributes Oscar-winning films such as “Moonlight,” Crockett said.
Owning Fox will also help Disney’s TV production. Fox has one of the largest TV studios, and a stake in Endemol Shine, maker of reality shows like “MasterChef” and “Deal or No Deal.” A larger slate of popular reality programming could allow Disney to license shows around the world, a profitable strategy that Warner Bros. has used with “The Bachelor.” 
To be sure, the ripple effect of a Disney-Fox combination in Hollywood will be muted somewhat by the recent arrival of Silicon Valley giants. Merging Disney and Fox would create one less buyer for movie and TV show ideas and almost certainly lead to job cuts. A few weeks after completing its acquisition of DreamWorks last year, Comcast cut about 200 jobs there. Tech companies like Netflix Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. could fill the void by buying more TV and movie scripts, and some job losses at Disney and Fox could be absorbed by these new entrants.
Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger is preparing to introduce the company’s own streaming-video services in the next couple of years. Disney movies that are now available on Netflix will be 
 the service so Iger’s company can offer them exclusively online. In an interview Thursday on Bloomberg Television, Iger said he’ll probably do the same with Fox programming that’s now available on HBO and Netflix.
“They have a relationship with Netflix and HBO, but we will be looking at more direct-to-consumer opportunities for our company,” Iger said. 
Disney’s purchase of Fox leaves unclear the futures of Fox film studio chief Stacey Snider and Dana Walden and Gary Newman, co-chairmen of Fox Television Group, since Disney already has a successful studio chairman in Alan Horn, and Ben Sherwood leads Disney’s ABC Television Group.
Amid the distraction of an impending deal, Fox studio employees have been soldiering on. Late Wednesday, senior members of the 20th Century Fox film team were making their way to the East Coast for the red-carpet premiere of the movie “The Post,” a continent away from the merger brewing in L.A.

Title: Japan Plans Carrot-and-Stick Tax Changes to Drive Wage Gains - Bloomberg

Japan will adopt a carrot-and-stick approach to boost pay for workers by providing tax benefits to companies that increase spending on wages and investment while clamping down on benefits for firms that don’t.
Companies that raise pay by at least 3 percent a year or invest in their human capital through skills training will be able to reduce their corporate income tax, according to documents from the ruling coalition obtained by Bloomberg News. The changes will be in place from fiscal 2018 to 2020, and may see some small and medium companies reduce their tax bills by up to 20 percent, according to the document.
Firms that don’t invest or increase pay will no longer be able to use existing deductions to cut their tax burdens, such as those for research and development.
The changes should help encourage more investment and increases in bonuses, but because it’s only a temporary measure and is unlikely to drive sustained gains in base wages, according to Koya Miyamae, senior fiscal policy analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. These measures are complex and difficult for companies to take advantage of, so cutting the corporate tax rate would have more effectively increased international competitiveness, he said.
The changes are expected to be announced by the ruling coalition’s tax panel before going to the cabinet for formal approval. They will then be approved by parliament, where the coalition has a majority in both houses. A vote is likely before the start of the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2018.
Changes are also coming for individual income tax. People earning more than 8.5 million yen ($75,000) will see their tax burden rise from January 2020 due to a decrease in the basic deduction. Policy makers aim to avoid increasing the tax burden for households that are raising children or caring for elderly relatives.
People who do not work for companies, such as freelancers or business owners, will see some benefit as their standard deduction will be increased slightly.
The coalition also plans to increase the levy on 
 from next April, and will also introduce a departure tax of 1,000 yen.
The changes will result in an extra 160 billion yen in revenue for the central government, and 120 billion yen for regional governments, according to Yoichi Miyazawa, the Liberal Democratic Party’s tax panel chief.

Title: Seven Ways Hotels Will Change in 2018 - Bloomberg

In response to the many geo-political, sociological, and technological changes that took place in 2017, five-star hotels are making changes—some small, some large. Here’s what to expect, based on predictions from a panel of leading industry insiders: Tina Edmundson, global brand officer at 
; Bjorn Hanson, clinical professor at NYU’s Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism; John Vanderslice, global head of luxury and lifestyle brands at 
; and Guy Langford and Marcello Gasdia, of Deloitte LLP’s travel, hospitality, and services group.
 
Hotels in major U.S. markets will become more expensive next year as the practice of adding resort fees, once reserved for getaways in exotic locales, becomes more and more common at urban properties—often with a nightly price tag of $25. NYU’s Hanson has noticed them most in New York, where high occupancy rates leave picky travelers with few alternatives. (They’re also rumored to be popping up in Chicago and Los Angeles.) Budget for the fee on business trips, as transparency is not yet what it should be. There is one slight silver lining: “This is better than hotels raising their room rates,” says Hanson, “since the fees aren’t subject to occupancy taxes.”
 
Enjoy those chocolates on your pillow, while you still can. “More and more hotels are making turndown service optional for two reasons. One is cost,” says NYU’s Hanson. The second, he says, is privacy. “We go through cycles when people are more private and more open, and right now—for reasons I can only speculate about—people are feeling more private about their personal space. Some people don’t like their toiletries straightened up.”
“It’s a fair comment” says Deloitte’s Langford. “My personal view is that there are things you value and things you don’t, and I don’t need anyone to turn down my bed. With certain companies, it may be part of a brand promise. But if it’s not, it’s a cost—and it doesn’t need to be provided.”
 
“Technology is top of mind for everyone right now,” says Marriott’s Edmundson—who oversees 
, including Ritz-Carlton, Edition, Luxury Collection, and St. Regis—specifically investment in the so-called “Internet of Things” (IoT) tech such as Nest temperature control units or Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa.
Marriott’s experimental “Internet of Things room,” created 
, includes showers that remember a guest’s preferred temperature, digital wall art that can be swapped for family photos, and mirrors with embedded displays—for on-demand yoga videos. The rooms will soft-launch in 2018; W hotels will likely be first to offer them.
Vanderslice may get there sooner. Hilton 
 a similarly teched-out room with mobile app controls for television, lighting, thermostat, and digital art. It will debut in major cities in the coming weeks, with a rapid rollout across all Hilton brands in 2018 and 2019. 
“2018 is going to be the year that the rubber hits the road with IoT technology,” says Deloitte’s Gasdia. “It took a while for this technology to mature, but now personalization can happen in real time. It’s a win-win for everybody.”
 
While lifestyle brands, such as Ace and 1 Hotels, have upended the old-fashioned lobby and turned it into a cool, collective workspace, luxury brands have largely stayed true to tradition. That will be challenged in 2018, says Hanson, who predicts that the check-in desk will slowly fade into oblivion, reflecting travelers’ shifting preferences for intimacy rather than formality. 
“Fifty years ago, people didn’t have credit cards, and bad guys would come jump the desk and steal the cash,” he begins. “But that’s not the case anymore, and hotels no longer need that type of tall, wide barrier. Now they’re thinking: ‘Why can’t we have a little seating area that’s very comfortable and intimate?’”
Living room-like check-in areas are indeed popping up at some of the world’s finest properties. Take the 
 in Paris, recently reopened after a four-year makeover by Rosewood. Its reception space is an elegant sitting room, with antique desks and a plush loveseat. The shift allows travelers to relax after a long journey—something Deloitte pinpointed as a key need, especially for business travelers, in its recent “Hotel of the Future”
study.
When the Eaton Workshop opens in Washington early next year, it will be 
. The company may be onto something. “Luxury customers are drawn to brands that communicate a sense of purpose—beyond just existing to sell something,” says Marriott’s Edmundson, pointing to “sky-high” engagement at two W hotel speaker series, “What She Said" and “Queer Me Out,” showcasing powerful women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ) thought leaders, respectively.
But it’s not in every brand’s DNA to plant such politically charged flags, so in 2018, top-tier brands will find softer ways to appeal to consumers’ values—being careful not to alienate any potential guests.
“Forty percent of guests will fall on one political extreme, and 40 will fall on the other,” says NYU’s Hanson. “Few are in the middle. But there are causes that nobody could disagree with, like human trafficking, 40 percent of which occurs in hotels,” he adds. “Nobody would be offended by a company taking a stand on that.”
 
“Wellness is going to be the next trillion-dollar industry,” predicts Deloitte’s Langford. “Everyone wants to capitalize on the huge swell, but 
. Nobody has figured it out yet.”
Already, Hyatt has bought legendary wellness brand Miraval 
, while JW Marriott has partnered with the Joffrey Ballet for on-demand barre classes. Meanwhile, Four Seasons has developed wellness rooms with de-chlorinating showers and Deepak Chopra meditation videos.
“At the bleeding edge, wellness resorts are changing their talent strategies, hiring more doctors, more NPs, more nutritionists—and that’s really expensive,” says Delotte’s Gasdia. “But they’re doing really well with revenue and gross bookings.” Hanson agrees: “With even select-service brands upgrading their fitness centers, this is a place where luxury brands have the physical space to stay ahead of the curve.”
Based on a recent survey of 5,000 Marriott guests, Edmundson says that “about 80 percent of respondents agreed that improving their physical 
 emotional well-being is more of a focus for them today than it was three years ago—sleep improvement, new diets, and meditation all scored high in terms of what travelers had participated in over the past 12 months.” Not coincidentally, her eight brands will “lean into this space” in 2018, with JW Marriott taking the leading role.  
 
The business of running a hotel company can no longer be boxed into four walls. “These days, we think of ourselves as being more in the travel business than the hotel business,” says Marriott’s Edmundson, who is overseeing the launch of 
 in the next two years.
“In every single sector, including travel, it’s all about ecosystems,” says Deloitte’s Gasdia. “Think about 
. It’s all about leveraging the power of adjacent spaces.” So what does that mean for travelers? Most notably, hotels will now attempt to fill up their itineraries with experiences and activities.
“The tours-and-activities space is going through a huge coming of digital age,” explains Gasdia—and hotels want to cash in. (
) Take Marriott’s 
, which unlocks 100,000 walking tours, biking excursions, and culinary classes in 800 destinations around the world. Or the new “Live Unforgettable” campaign for Waldorf Astoria; Hilton’s Vanderslice says it will link hotel guests with such celebrities as Gabrielle Union at high-profile dinner events.
NYU’s Hanson argues that selling activities is crucial for luxury hotels. It helps them control the end-to-end shopping experience, offers data that can feed guest personalization, and distinguishes high-end properties from mid-tier ones.
“Luxury hotels need to do more. We get ironing boards and bathrobes everywhere, don’t need business centers, and even the concierge has become irrelevant,” he explains. Experiences, though, are a winnable space. “Local walking tours, comped theater tickets, exhibits in the hotels, manager receptions for frequent guests—these are the types of things that only luxury hotels can do.”

Title: Europe Sets Pace for Global M&A as Politics Hurt U.S. Deals - Bloomberg

Europe, often a laggard compared to the U.S. in mergers and acquisitions, has turned out to be the hot spot for deals this year.
A more stable economic outlook and growing confidence in Europe have boosted dealmaking activity in the region, while in the U.S., the unresolved battle to lower U.S. corporate tax rates as well as fewer blockbuster deals have contributed to lower volumes. Buyers have announced $680 billion of acquisitions targeting European companies in 2017, up 23 percent from last year’s total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The year is ending on a high note for both European suitors and targets. 
 on Monday made a $5.1 billion unsolicited bid for 
. Just hours later, 
’s unveiled its purchase of Australia’s Westfield Corp. for almost $16 billion.
By contrast, the value of announced deals in North America has fallen almost 30 percent to $1.1 trillion this year -- the lowest since 2013 -- and Asia is fairly flat at $626 billion. While North America still accounts for 44 percent of global M&A volumes, that’s down by almost a tenth from this time last year and the smallest proportion since 2010. Europe, meanwhile, is at a six-year high, contributing 27 percent of total dealmaking.
“Europe is going through a period of economic resurgence and this will continue through 2018,” said William Rucker, chief executive officer of Lazard Ltd. in the U.K. “Macroeconomic conditions are supportive of M&A activity and business confidence is back.”
Despite the surge, global M&A volumes are still on track for the slowest year since 2013. Just $2.5 trillion of mergers and acquisitions have been announced, well below the $3 trillion-plus figures recorded in 2015 and 2016. Overseas acquisitions by Chinese companies, in particular, have significantly dropped since as dealmakers struggle to cope with tighter capital controls and increasingly wary counterparties.
The year started with some of the biggest European deals. French lensmaker 
 agreed to purchase Luxottica Group SpA, the Italian producer of Ray-Ban sunglasses, for about $24 billion. Johnson & Johnson bought Swiss biotech firm Actelion Ltd. for $30 billion.
The outcome of other European mega deals won’t be clear until next year. A winner is yet to be decided in the race for Spanish toll-road operator Abertis Infraestructuras SA, which is being sought by Italy’s Atlantia SpA and Hochtief AG, the German unit of Spanish builder ACS. Still, dealmakers are optimistic that 2018 will continue the trend.
“With economic growth back on track and good financing conditions, we are in for a good M&A year in Europe in 2018 as companies try to create European champions on the continent,” Alison Harding-Jones, 
’s London-based head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a phone interview. “CEOs have realized the need to form bigger, stronger European competitors to compete globally."
Beyond mergers, one key driver for M&A across sectors this year is asset disposals, said Paul Hammes, global divestment leader at consulting firm EY. “CEOs are refocusing their strategy and shedding units that no longer fit with the company’s core business," he said.
In the U.S., companies shied away from large-scale M&A as they spent much of the year waiting to see how regulatory enforcement would take shape under President Donald Trump and whether the administration would be able to deliver on promises to overhaul the tax code. Just three U.S. deals valued at more than $30 billion have been announced in 2017 -- all of them since September.
“The first half of 2017 was smaller, tactical deals in the U.S., where the second half is being driven by large changes in industry structures,” said Michael Carr, global co-head of 
’s M&A group. “If the structure of your industry is changing, you have to get ahead of it or respond rapidly.”
CVS Health Corp. waited until December to announce its $68 billion deal to buy 
 after an Obama-era antitrust lawsuit forced the insurer in February to abandon its takeover of Humana Inc. 
’s acquisition of many of 21st Century Fox Inc.’s assets could be announced as 
 as this week.
’s $105 billion unsolicited bid for 
 would be the biggest tech deal on record if it goes ahead next year.
The flurry of larger deals late in the year could continue in 2018, especially for companies seeking growth or in industries seeing widespread disruption, according to Carr. 
Uncertainty doesn’t always damp dealmaking -- just look at the U.K. Even amid the turmoil caused by the country’s planned departure from the European Union, dealmaking has increased 9.5 percent this year to $176 billion, though the growth is lower than most other European countries.
Spain is leading the pack. Deals involving Spanish targets totaled almost $115 billion in 2017, the highest in a decade, Bloomberg data show. In addition to the potential Abertis takeover, 
’s is spending $4.7 billion on real estate assets from Spanish bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA.
“While the U.K. has lagged behind in M&A terms amid political and regulatory uncertainties, Europe is seen as an attractive market at the moment,” said Luca Ferrari, head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at

Title: Demand for AI Talent Turns Once-Staid Conference Into Draft Day - Bloomberg

Actors in robot costumes stood in the lobby of the Westin hotel in Long Beach, California on Sunday night, “Intel Inside” stickers displayed on their foam torsos. People posed for selfies before heading to an upstairs ballroom, decorated with neon purple lighting and plush white leather furniture, for an event that was more party than technology panel discussion.
This was one of many attempts by Intel Corp. and other giant corporations to curry favor with artificial-intelligence researchers attending one of the world’s biggest AI conferences, turning what was once an academic event into a recruiting frenzy more akin to the National Football League’s draft day.
Tech companies are increasingly competing with one another, as well as banks and hedge funds, to hire experts in AI techniques like neural networking, a kind of machine learning loosely based on how the human brain works. These are the skills behind recent advances in computers’ ability to identify objects in images, translate languages, drive cars and spot financial fraud. More changes are in store for many industries and conferences like this week’s one on Neural Information Processing Systems, aka NIPS, are where companies can go to hire the talent they need to embrace their AI future.  
NIPS began 30 years ago, and as recently as 2013, fewer than 2,000 people attended. This year, it attracted more than 7,500 – almost 40 percent over last year. Conference tickets sold out in 12 days compared with six weeks last year. And yet demand continues to far exceed supply, with “machine learning” job postings on recruiting site Monster.com more than doubling in the past year.
“With talent this scarce, it can be hard to find people,” said Chris Rice, the head of global talent acquisition for Intel’s AI product group. “You’ve got to reach out to people at events like this. This is the biggest event for AI for the year, so you have to be here.”
That scarcity has driven up salaries. Newly minted Ph.D.s earn north of $300,000 and top-ranked senior academics command multimillion-dollar, multiyear contracts. Salaries at DeepMind, an AI company owned by Alphabet Inc., averaged $345,000 in 2016, according to U.K. regulatory filings. 
That soaring compensation has changed NIPS, which once brought together a few hundred academics in a small hotel conference space, with little corporate sponsorship and no press attention. Bemoaned by some, and applauded by others, the transformation follows a similar path as other areas of technology, like the internet and bitcoin, that began as wonky technical fields only to become lucrative battlegrounds for billionaires and corporations. 
This year, in a cavernous convention hall, eager students, new graduates and more experienced academics thread their way between booths, grabbing swag – free T-shirts, water bottles and fidget spinners – and chatting casually with recruiters from corporations such as Google, DeepMind, Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., IBM, Amazon.com Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., Airbnb Inc., Netflix Inc. and Snap Inc. The conference drew 54 corporate sponsors this year compared with 16 five years ago.
Startups and less-well known AI consulting firms are present too along with a growing contingent of financial firms, including banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and hedge fund firms like Man Group Plc’s AHL division. (Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News, sponsors the conference and uses it to recruit machine-learning experts, too.)
IBM interviewed candidates practically back-to-back all day long in a convention center meeting room at NIPS. “It’s extremely competitive, especially for getting experts on neural networks,” Dario Gil, head of IBM’s AI research, said.
Citadel, the $27 billion hedge fund firm founded by Kenneth Griffin, this year put on a series of lunches at the Hyatt Regency for interested job candidates.
Xavier Amatriain, co-founder of AI startup Curai and a Netflix alum, said Amazon has tried an unusual tactic to recruit him at NIPS. “Amazon knows that I’m a runner so invited me to their morning running group,” he said. “It’s a way of getting connected, so they are going to try to hire you while you’re running.”
Much of the real action takes place in the evening at private parties corporations host at swank clubs and restaurants for a select list of invitees they are particularly keen on wooing. Conference organizers have had to plead with corporate sponsors not to hold events that start before 9 p.m., for fear of drawing too many attendees away from the official business each evening: academic “poster talks” in which researchers discuss their papers for hours in front of a poster summarizing their work.
Other companies have taken a lower-key, soft-sell approach. “We find having a quiet conversation about goals and philosophy is always preferable to a crowded booth or hectic party,” said Dileep George, co-founder of San Francisco-based AI company Vicarious. 
Alex Smola, director of machine learning at Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud computing business, said corporate AI hiring is having the opposite impact -- rather than brain drain, it's drawing more smart people into the field of study. You can see that at NIPS this year, he said.
When Smola finished a degree in the 1990s, he threw a graduation party at NIPS and invited about half the conference attendees. There were 150 to 200 people and he knew everyone.
"If I tried inviting half of NIPS to a party, this wouldn't work any more because it's 7,000 to 8,000 people now,” he said. “It's probably 20 times as many smart people who have joined."

Title: Disney's Fox Deal Faces U.S. Antitrust Officials That Sued AT&T - Bloomberg

Walt Disney Co.’s deal to buy a chunk of 21st Century Fox Inc. will need approval from U.S. antitrust officials who are sure to scrutinize a tie-up that concentrates Hollywood movie-making and sports broadcasting.
The acquisition would make Disney the No. 1 studio owner, with more than a third of the market, and give it control over Fox’s FX cable channel. It would also put Fox’s regional sports networks under the same roof as Disney’s ESPN.
Whether control over all that content could give Disney the power to harm rivals will be a key question for a Justice Department fresh off a legal challenge to AT&T Inc.’s planned takeover of Time Warner Inc., a case based on concerns about the phone giant’s ownership of the media company’s programming.
“They’d have enormous power in the entertainment and production sphere,” Gene Kimmelman, the head of Washington policy group Public Knowledge, said of Disney. “When you have too much content tied together, it really does create a market power problem in a transaction.”
Disney will owe Fox a $2.5 billion breakup fee if it’s unable to get regulatory approval for the deal, according to a filing Thursday. If either company abandons the deal for other reasons, it owes the other $1.53 billion.
By acquiring more TV assets, Disney could put pressure on pay-TV companies to buy a bigger bundle of programming, said Kimmelman. That would harm competition from online distributors like Dish Network Corp.’s Sling TV, which is only interested in providing a limited number of channels, he said.
Disney is already considered by pay-TV distributors as “undroppable,” according to Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG. Adding regional sports networks and FX would give Disney even greater leverage over pay-TV companies and make it tougher for new online distributors to get off the ground, he said.
“Imagine the local market power Disney would command in a market such as New York,” Greenfield wrote in a note this week. “Disney would control the ABC affiliate that has the NBA finals and the Oscars, the YES Network, and ESPN/ESPN2.” YES carries New York Yankees games.
Still, Disney isn’t getting marquee Fox properties Fox News and Fox Sports. While it will own FX -- the home of acclaimed shows such as “The Americans” and “Atlanta” -- that’s not the same kind of high-value programming at issue in AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner, said 
, an economist at Cornell University who studies antitrust and competition.
“I don’t see FX as being anywhere near the kind of gem as CNN or HBO,” Hay said.
Based on 
 published by Box Office Mojo, the movie-studio market isn’t currently concentrated under the Justice Department’s merger guidelines. The Fox deal would make it “moderately concentrated” and raise potential antitrust concerns.
Still, Disney’s control over Fox’s movie studio shouldn’t be a problem, according to Hay. The combination will still leave a number of other competitors in the market, including Time Warner’s Warner Bros. and Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures.
“How important will the studio be?” said Hay. “The clout you carry when you have these old lots isn’t what it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago.”
European antitrust regulators would also scrutinize the combination, in part because Disney will buy Fox’s stake in Sky Plc, the satellite-TV provider with customers in five countries. While Disney’s ownership of Sky would be smiled upon, winning approvals for the broader deal with Fox will be tougher, said Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis in London. Antitrust authorities in the U.S. and Europe will look at whether Disney’s clout could let it extract higher payouts at the box office. 
The European Commission’s ongoing pay-TV investigation makes competition concerns there more likely, she added. Sky is currently being 
 by EU antitrust regulators over pay-TV clauses with Hollywood studios, including Disney, that may restrict sales across Europe.

Title: China Is Said to Extend Tax Rebate to Reach Clean-Fuel Auto Goal - Bloomberg

China is set to extend a 10 percent tax rebate to buyers of new energy autos as manufacturers from 
 to 
 vie for a greater share of the world’s biggest market for clean-fuel cars, according to people with knowledge of the plan.
The rebate was due to expire at the end of this year and will now run through at least 2020, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The Ministry of Finance didn’t respond to a fax seeking comments.
The surge in demand for such vehicles in China has attracted billions of dollars of investments from 
, 
 and other carmakers while Tesla is mulling setting up a factory there. The government has recently announced a series of measures regarding manufacturing licenses and joint ventures that would allow foreign companies to set up solely owned assemblies.
“China wants the number of new energy vehicles to grow, and I’m sure they’ll take many additional steps if they’re not meeting their targets,” said Yunshi Wang, director of the China Center for Energy and Transportation at the University of California, Davis.
Sales of NEVs surged 53 percent to 500,700 units last year and boosted the overall ownership of such vehicles in the country to over a million units. That’s more than triple the tally in 2015, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
Shares of Chinese carmakers gained in early Hong Kong trading before succumbing to a marketwide selloff. BYD Co., the carmaker backed by Warren Buffett, dropped 0.6 percent in Hong Kong trading after gaining as much as 2 percent earlier. BAIC ended the day with a 0.1 percent rise after jumping as much as 3.2 percent earlier while the benchmark Hang Seng Index tumbled 1 percent.
Automakers are all gearing up for a big surge in sales of clean-energy vehicles. BMW is targeting another 
 hike in plug-in hybrid and battery car sales next year to defend its position in the electric-car shift as competitors like Volkswagen ready their own battery lineups.
China’s government is working with regulators on setting a 
 for ending production and sales of internal-combustion vehicles, Xin Guobin, the vice minister of industry and information technology, said in September. The world’s second-biggest economy, which has vowed to cap its carbon emissions by 2030 and curb worsening air pollution, joined the U.K. and France in seeking a timetable for the elimination of vehicles using gasoline and diesel.
While the government wants to encourage consumers to buy more electric vehicles, the authorities are also concerned about overall subsidies. Different arms of the government have been working on plans to scale back overall subsidies on purchase of NEVs next year and a consensus has not yet been reached, according to people familiar with the discussion.
The government is also considering a resumption of new permits to make electric vehicles as early as the first half of 2018, a move that would clear the way for Ford and Tesla as well as a string of local manufacturers to start production, Bloomberg news 
 last month, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Since March 2016, China has handed out 15 EV licenses -- local manufacturer Wanxiang Group and a Volkswagen joint venture were among the recipients -- to foster competition for the predominantly state-owned auto industry. The ensuing rush saw makers of smart TVs to air conditioners drumming up plans to enter the auto industry.
In 2018, electric vehicles will 
 consumer goods as the biggest market segment for lithium-ion batteries on an annual basis, according to an energy storage forecast report published recently by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Battery prices need to drop by more than half before EVs will be competitive with cars powered by internal-combustion engines, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That’s likely to happen by 
, when the cost for lithium-ion battery packs is projected to fall to about $100 per kilowatt hour.

Title: Bitcoin Rally Boosts Smaller Cryptos Litecoin, Ether to Records - Bloomberg

Bitcoin is giving its smaller cousins a hand.
Ether and litecoin, the second and fourth biggest cryptocurrencies, are surging to all-time highs on optimism that bitcoin futures will attract institutions to the fledgling market. The rallies come as speculators flock to Coinbase.com Inc., whose app last week climbed to the top of Apple Inc.’s download rankings. Known mainly as one of the easiest ways to trade bitcoin, the site also provides access to trading litecoin, ether and bitcoin cash.
Litecoin has more than doubled to as high as $401 since Dec. 10, before bitcoin derivatives started trading on Cboe Global Markets Inc., while ether has soared about 40 percent in that time to $633, according to CryptoCompare, a website tracking digital currency prices.
The crush to trade ether as it rallied Tuesday 
 Coinbase’s system, forcing the exchange to issue a notice saying “buys, sells temporarily disabled.” The incident persisted for over an hour.
The gains are even beating bitcoin’s advance as some traders move into digital assets that have lagged bitcoin’s 17-fold rally this year, and as others speculate there is more room to gain because of their smaller market capitalizations. All 20 of the biggest cryptocurrencies are rising today, according to CoinMarketCap, with litecoin advancing the most.
“It’s both, people are trading out of bitcoin, and new money coming to the space, and they’ll be thinking very simply, ‘how do I get more of these extraordinary returns?”’ said Charles Hayter, co-founder of CryptoCompare. “It’s herd-like mentality that takes off, which is very dangerous.”
Even litecoin’s creator Charlie Lee is warning that the run up in prices may be overdone. 
“Every crypto bull run I’ve seen has been followed by a bear cycle,” Lee tweeted Monday. “The market needs time to consolidate. That’s just my experience from seven years of watching this space.”

Title: AT&T Commits to Time Warner Deal Even as Judge Delays Deadline - Bloomberg

The U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit to block 
 from buying 
 will go to trial March 19, a later date than the companies had sought to begin their epic legal fight with the government.
With the trial more than three months off, AT&T and Time Warner will have to extend their self-imposed April 22 deadline for completing the $85.4 billion deal. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said Thursday in Washington that the companies should push back the cutoff date by 60 to 90 days to give him time to make a decision.
“We will promptly discuss the court’s post-trial schedule with Time Warner,” AT&T General Counsel David McAtee said in a statement. “We are committed to this transaction and look forward to presenting our case in March.”
If approved, the deal would reshape the media landscape by uniting a telecom giant with the owner of CNN, Warner Bros., TNT, TBS and HBO. AT&T, the owner of DirecTV, is the largest pay-TV distributor, as well as a powerhouse in mobile phones and landlines. The Justice Department has argued that letting AT&T own the films and TV shows that flow down its pipes would harm consumers and competitors.
Under their current agreement, if AT&T and Time Warner fail to complete their deal by April 22, they can choose to extend the deadline or either party can walk away. If the judge blocks the deal, AT&T must pay Time Warner a breakup fee of $500 million.
“This is not a normal case from many perspectives,” Leon said from the bench Thursday. He estimated the trial would take about three weeks. “This is going to be a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifice.”
Shares of Time Warner briefly fell when the court date was set, dropping as much as 0.6 percent after being up much of the day. The stock was down 0.1 percent to $90.28 at 3:51 p.m. in New York. AT&T rose 0.2 percent to $36.19.
The Justice Department 
 to block AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner on Nov. 20, saying the merger would mean higher television bills and fewer innovative entertainment options. The company has said a deal would pave the way for new advertising approaches that tailor messages to individual viewers.
The lawsuit suggests the government will take a hard look at other deals in entertainment. That’s particularly relevant with Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp. making competing offers to acquire billions of dollars entertainment and pay-TV assets from 21st Century Fox Inc.
The legal challenge -- the first major antitrust enforcement action to be brought by the Trump administration -- dealt a blow to a tie-up that appeared to be sailing toward approval as recently as October.
Makan Delrahim, the new head of the antitrust division under the Trump administration, had pushed for a sale of either Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting division, which owns cable channels including CNN, TNT and Turner Sports, or DirecTV, the satellite provider AT&T bought in 2015.
AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson said he wasn’t willing to sell CNN to appease Washington and promised to 
 the lawsuit, setting up a court battle that now won’t be decided until the spring.
Delrahim was present for the opening hearing in his first lawsuit as the Justice Department’s new antitrust chief. He sat at a bench behind the counsel table occupied by Craig Conrath and the department’s other trial lawyers.
AT&T had sought a Feb. 20 date for the trial while government attorneys countered with May 7.
Citing his own congested trial calendar, the judge urged the parties Thursday to keep disagreements to a minimum, inviting the court’s intervention only when necessary.
“We recognize this is an intensive burden for the court,” AT&T attorney Daniel Petrocelli told the court, adding his side would do all it could to avoid “needless friction” with the government’s lawyers. Petrocelli also said he and his co-counsel would relay to their clients the judge’s insistence they move their deadline and the report back to Leon.
The next court date is Dec. 21.
“The people who are in are all in, including me,” the judge said, counseling against anyone involved in the case taking vacations or days off in the run-up to the trial.
The case is U.S. v. AT&T Inc., 17-cv-2511, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).

Title: Tesla’s NYC Store Sells Solar, Cars and Home Batteries Under One Roof - Bloomberg

If there’s any doubt 
 isn’t just a car company anymore, its brand-new Manhattan showroom should put it to bed. On Friday, Tesla opens a store in New York’s Meatpacking District that, for the first time, will sell cars, solar panels and batteries permanently under one roof.
In a sparse, glass-walled space, the Model X sport utility vehicle and Model S sedan are on display alongside solar offerings and Powerwall storage systems. A Model S sits across from a sign that reads: “Produce Your Own Clean Energy.” In this store and others that Tesla’s enhancing across the U.S. starting Friday, car and energy salesmen will work side-by-side.
Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk took a big gamble buying 
 last year. It opened up the billionaire to harsh criticism from some investors who described his takeover of the solar company—led at that time by his cousin, Lyndon Rive—as a bailout rife with conflicts of interest. The synergies of solar and electric vehicles weren’t immediately clear, and Tesla has been working to integrate the businesses ever since, positioning itself as an energy—not strictly a car—company. This new New York store is the physical manifestation of that.
Besides an occasional pop-up, solar was rarely before available in Tesla stores. Now, potential solar customers can discuss the power products with energy-focused salespeople in person—before or after checking out a new SUV. If they like the pitch, a site surveyor will then be sent to their homes to finalize the plan, followed by installation. Employing energy consultants directly in stores on a permanent basis lets the company cross-sell products and puts it on the offense at a time when residential solar is slumping in the U.S. after 16 
 of growth.
Although solar panels and the Powerwall home battery system are on display, noticeably missing from the expanded offerings in the 10,900-square-foot (1,013-square-meter) showroom is the Model 3, Tesla’s more affordable and much-hyped electric sedan that began production in July. Output of the car, which starts at $35,000 before options, has been plagued by production bottlenecks, though the first non-employee customers just began getting their cars, suggesting progress on the production front.
The long-anticipated Tesla solar roof is also not on display at the new Manhattan location, which replaces Tesla’s smaller storefront in Chelsea. They’re expected to be sold in stores in 2018 after testing is completed on those installed on employees’ houses.
Next year, Tesla customers will also be able to begin taking delivery of their electric cars at the Meatpacking location, rather than going to the Brooklyn store to pick up their new rides. The Manhattan store won’t offer a service center like the Red Hook showroom near Brooklyn’s industrial waterfront does—but it does have a free espresso bar for Tesla customers.
The opening of the new Manhattan store coincides with an important company event: the completed integration of SolarCity into Tesla. In the year since Tesla paid $2 billion to buy SolarCity, it’s ditched its door-to-door sales model, and next week, the integration is expected to be complete. With the exception of a website, the SolarCity name will mostly vanish, with all solar products instead sold under the Tesla brand.
Though the synergies of solar and electric vehicles weren’t immediately obvious, the deal proved prescient: Other solar installers seeking to reduce high marketing costs amid market contraction have since 
 with better-known brands. Tesla has also refocused the solar unit’s strategy. SolarCity, which popularized the no-money-down lease, chased growth at all costs and amassed more than $3 billion in debt along the way. Tesla’s energy unit has had success with solar-panel sales and appears more focused on profitability.
The new store may be in the heart of one of Manhattan’s toniest sales corridors, but it’s not intended just for downtown residents. The area draws tourists and commuters, and the store is situated beneath the heavily trafficked High Line elevated park.
Expansive floor-to-ceiling glass faces out at The Standard hotel, allowing for sun to pour into the mostly white interior. The new store is on the same block as a Diane von Furstenberg showroom and is just a few blocks from an 
 store, which sports a similar clean, crisp design.
The rented space includes several mounted touch-screens where buyers can configure their Model S and Model X vehicles, which are available for delivery to customers in the next month or two. Drivers can also put down $1,000 reservations for the Model 3, much like they do online. But with a wait list of some half a million customers, most buyers placing an order this week won’t get their Model 3s until next Christmas—or later.
For any holiday shoppers who can’t wait a year or more for their Model 3s, solar panels—which could be installed within the month, permits and snowfall willing—may be the way to go. There’s an energy consultant on-site.

Title: Bitcoin Heads to Bigger Wall Street Stage as CME Debuts Futures - Bloomberg

The world’s biggest exchange is joining the bitcoin revolution.
Bitcoin futures start trading Sunday night at CME Group Inc.’s venue, a week after Chicago rival Cboe Global Markets Inc. 
 similar derivatives on the volatile cryptocurrency.
CME’s version could make a bigger splash because the company is a much bigger player in futures than Cboe, handling about 55 times more volume during the first nine months of 2017, according to the Futures Industry Association. Cboe has so far traded more than 10,000 contracts representing about $180 million in bitcoin, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Many traders couldn’t access that contract because some brokers didn’t immediately offer them, said Garrett See, chief executive officer of crypto trading firm DV Chain.
“CME’s bitcoin contract may not be first, but they are a larger futures clearinghouse and we are looking forward to our clients trading their product on Sunday evening,” Brooks Dudley, vice president of risk in New York at ED&F Man Capital Markets, said in an email. “Not all market participants have been able to short the Cboe bitcoin futures. We have allowed our clients to go long or short to take advantage of dislocations between the futures and the underlying spot market.”
The CME futures are another step into the mainstream financial world for an asset created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as an alternative to banks and government-issued currencies. The contracts, which settle in dollars and trade on regulated exchanges, can be bought by institutional investors that are prohibited from buying bitcoin directly on largely unregulated exchanges.
“One of the biggest issues when it comes to investing institutionally in digital assets is banks and larger institutions can’t hold an unregulated instrument in their balance sheet, and a futures contract is something they can hold,” said Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital-asset strategy at VanEck Associates Corp. With futures, “you don’t hold the physical bitcoin, which solves custody issues and counterparty risks with these less-regulated exchanges.”
To protect against wild, mistaken price swings, CME will briefly pause trading if the contracts rise or fall 7 percent or 13 percent, and prices won’t be allowed to move more than 20 percent. Cboe also has volatility halts, which were triggered in the initial hours of trading a week ago, and its January contract rose as much as 26 percent on the first day.
“Bitcoin is a very volatile asset,” said DV Chain’s See. “It’s going to be interesting to see how often we hit limits and how long we stay there.”
Futures open up arbitrage opportunities -- the chance to bet prices of the derivatives and the underlying cryptocurrency will converge. Last week, Cboe’s product was priced as much as 13 percent higher than bitcoin, but that quickly narrowed toward 1 percent.
The CME and Cboe bitcoin futures have some distinct features. Each Cboe contract represents a single bitcoin, whereas CME’s are linked to five. If CME handles 500 contracts while Cboe does 2,500 in a day, that could be viewed as a tie. The price of Cboe’s product is derived from the cryptocurrency’s price at a single exchange; CME’s is based off four.
Some brokerages didn’t immediately give customers access to bitcoin futures. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. 
 that it will offer Cboe’s starting on Monday, though it’ll wait to offer the CME contracts until they demonstrate sufficient liquidity. E*Trade Financial Corp. is considering offering bitcoin futures, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.
“We look at the volume, the open interest and the spreads, and we want to make sure that all those conditions are maturing properly,” said JB Mackenzie, managing director for futures trading at TD Ameritrade. “We have had a lot of customer interest, and we have spent a lot of time educating them as to the differences between the two products.”
Banks and brokers who are offering access are being cautious. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. demanded some clients set aside collateral equal to 100 percent of the value of their trades, people familiar with the investments 
. The guidelines are inclusive of other margin requirements such as Options Clearing Corp.’s 44 percent, required to clear contracts traded at Cboe, and the 47 percent CME is demanding.
It’s not uncommon for a brokerage to impose steeper requirements than the exchange. Interactive Brokers Group Inc., which has said it handled 53 percent of the first day’s trading in Cboe’s bitcoin futures, will require a margin of 50 percent for long investments, and about 240 percent for short selling, based on current rates, according to Interactive Brokers spokeswoman Kalen Holliday.

Title: Disney's `Last Jedi’ Blasts Its Way to $220 Million Opening - Bloomberg

The Force is strong with this one, too.
“Star Wars: The Last Jedi,’’ the latest installment of the epic sci-fi adventure series now owned by 
, met the high expectations set by movie fans and analysts with an opening weekend of $220 million in the U.S. and the Canada.
The results, based on estimates released Sunday by ComScore Inc., put the film squarely ahead of last year’s spinoff movie “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” which took in $158 million in its opening weekend. It will likely establish “The Last Jedi” as the top-grossing picture of 2017. The new film reaped $230 million in other countries around the world, except China, where it will open next month. Disney had expected $225 million overseas.
Disney set a high bar for itself. The first chapter in the latest trilogy, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” took in an all-time North American record of 
 in its opening weekend in 2015. Independent forecasts for “The Last Jedi” had run as high as $226 million from the Hollywood Stock Exchange and $210 million from Box Office Pro. Disney predicted the film would take in about $200 million.
“This just speaks to the power of Disney storytelling -- how they are able to get their movies right time after time,” said Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Especially this year when we have so much concern with ‘sequilitis’ or franchise fatigue.”
The strong performance of “The Last Jedi” will reassure investors in Disney, which has at least five more “Star Wars” films in the works and 
 made an even bigger commitment to the film business through its $66.1 billion acquisition of 
’s entertainment assets.
“The Last Jedi” was well received by critics, with 96 percent positive reviews from top critics, according to aggregator RottenTomatoes.com. As they did for previous “Star Wars” films, fans began lining up outside theaters days before the debut. The film took in $45 million Thursday evening shows in the U.S. and Canada, an amount bested only by “The Force Awakens” two years ago.
“To have a movie do $220 million domestically is an extraordinary thing and to be as close to the phenomenon that was ‘The Force Awakens’ is certainly more than we expected,” Dave Hollis, Disney’s global head of distribution, said in a telephone interview Sunday.
The movie picks up where that film ended, with Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, seeking out Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker to encourage him to take up his light saber and fight with the Resistance. Carrie Fisher returned as Princess Leia. Fisher’s death in December 2016, after filming was complete, probably brought fans in to see her final performance.
Younger actors, including Adam Driver as bad guy Kylo Ren, and John Boyega and Oscar Isaac, reprising their roles as Resistance fighters Finn and Poe Dameron, no doubt drew in a new generation of devotees.
Some viewers have posted negative comments about the movie on RottenTomatoes, while other measures of audience reaction from Cinemascore and ComScore have been positive.
Any online debate over the movie is just another reason to see the film, Hollis said.  “It turns conversation into fuel that ultimately drives people back into movie theaters,” he said.
Disney didn’t disclose the budget of the film. “The Force Awakens” cost $245 million and brought in $2.07 billion worldwide over its theatrical run, including $936.7 million in North America.
Fox offered the only other wide release this weekend with the animated film “Ferdinand.’’ It generated $13.3 million while coming in second. The story of a kind-hearted bull trying to find his way back home scored 75 percent positive reviews from top critics on RottenTomatoes. It had a production budget of $111 million and was projected to place second with $17 million on its debut, according to Box Office Mojo.

Title: The Easiest Cocktails to Make for All Your Holiday Parties - Bloomberg

Holiday party season is upon us. And if you’re hosting, the question of what drinks to serve is almost as pressing as gift lists.
As with most things, the trick, of course, is to not overthink it.  
“People are looking for more streamlined drinks,” says Kara Newman, spirits editor for 
I think it's a backlash to years of overwrought cocktail books written by bartenders who mean well but have access to a bar that's so much more vast than anyone has at home. No one should need 10 bottles to make a single drink.”
In 
 (2016, Chronicle Books), Newman has found that the easiest “easy” cocktails are the ones that have equal proportions of ingredients. She advises prebatching the drinks and chilling them in the fridge. Skip the bitsy jigger and simply pour cupfuls into a pitcher, stir, and decant into bottles.
“That's the beauty of equal-parts drinks, they scale beautifully,” enthuses Newman. “You don't really need a recipe. You don't even really need a measuring cup—you could use a Quaker Oatmeal canister, and as long as you measure the same amount of every ingredient, the drink will work.”
There’s one caveat: If the drink is meant to be shaken or stirred with ice, but you opt to pop it into your fridge instead, be sure to add a little water to approximate the dilution you would have gotten as you mixed each individually. 
Robert Simonson, the celebrated drinks and liquor writer at the 
, has also written a book that doubles as a resource for stressed hosts. His 
 (2017, Ten Speed Press) points out that classic cocktails have endured because they are, by and large, simple.
“If 
 had eight ingredients, nobody would be making it today—at least not at home and probably not at many bars,” he opines in his book. He doubled down on that in an email, noting that there’s a move at present toward simplicity. “After many years of bars serving up rococo cocktails with elaborate presentations, I do think there is at present a movement back toward simplicity. Complex cocktails will always have their place, but that place should be in the bar, in the hands of professionals.”
He notes that besides his and Newman’s books, more are on the way, such as Maggie Hoffman’s upcoming 
.  “They are a reminder that excellence is within the grasp of the home bartender without maxing out your credit card at the liquor store and renting a U-Haul to bring your purchases home.” Amen.
Whatever you decide to make—and we have five can’t-fail recipes below—use top-notch liquor and think about having two instead of five. To paraphrase venerated mixologist Jim Meehan, this holiday drinking season 
.
 
3-Ingredient Cocktails 
The author created this drink for a party at an architecture gallery decorated in white that didn’t want to risk the spillage of dark spirits. It cleverly riffs on the classic, brandy-based Harvard.
Serves 12
24 oz. pisco
12 oz. bianco vermouth
About 36 dashes of orange bitters
12 lemon twists 
In a large pitcher, combine all the ingredients except the lemon twists. Add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into another pitcher or container and refrigerate until serving.
To serve, pour into chilled coupes. Twist a lemon twist over each drink, drop into the glass and serve.
 
Shake. Stir. Sip. 
Serves 12
Like a regular Negroni—equal parts gin, sweet vermouth, and Campari—Newman notes that it’s easy to scale this drink up or down; you can double it for a bigger crowd or make just one drink. New York bartender Lynnette Marrero created this variation in which the rich, deep tones of aged rum combined with luscious amontillado really do evoke caramel and toffee without overt sweetness.
12 oz. aged rum
12 oz. amontillado sherry
12 oz. Aperol
12 grapefruit twists
In a large pitcher, combine the rum, sherry, and Aperol. Add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into another pitcher or container and refrigerate until serving.
To serve, pour into a rocks glass over a large cube of ice. Garnish with a grapefruit twist.
 
Shake. Stir. Sip. 
Serves 12
Newman credits Audrey Saunders, co-owner of New York’s famed Pegu Club, for reviving this martini style, tweaking it, and giving it a saucier name. “This is literally two ingredients, in equal parts. It does not get any easier than this.” 
36 oz. gin
36 oz. dry vermouth
24 dashes orange bitters
12 lemon twists
In a large pitcher, combine the gin, vermouth, and bitters. Add about ½ cup of water to mimic ice dilution. Refrigerate until serving.
To serve, pour into chilled martini glasses and garnish with lemon twists.
Note: To make a more classic martini, omit the orange bitters and substitute olives for the twists.
 
Serves 12
Waugh calls this the “Millionaire’s Tequila Old Fashioned”—Don Julio 1942, a premium aged tequila, meets Don the Beachcomber, thanks to a cinnamon-grapefruit-flavor combo known in the trade as “Don’s Mix.” Keep this one reserved for more intimate occasions.
12 oz. Don Julio 1942
12 oz. añejo tequila
6 oz. Grapefruit-Cinnamon Syrup (see below)
24 dashes Bittermens Elemakule Tiki bitters or Angostura bitters
12 grapefruit twists for garnish (optional)
In a large pitcher combine all the ingredients except the grapefruit twists. Add about ½ cup of water to mimic dilution. Refrigerate until serving.
To serve, pour into rocks glasses with one large ice cube and garnish with grapefruit twists.
To make Grapefruit-Cinnamon Syrup, simmer cane syrup (or equal parts water and sugar) with 2 to 3 cinnamon sticks over low heat for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add large strips of zest from 1 grapefruit, and let infuse until the syrup is flavored. Keep the extra on hand for all your tequila drinks.  
Serves 16-20
During the holiday season, Levy turns (and returns) to this simple, hassle-free punch recipe with three easy-to-find ingredients that anyone can whip up in three minutes. “That inspired the name, the Trifecta Punch. Gin is a nice alternative to brown spirits often used in punch. Slightly bitter Aperol provides contrast and lends a great winter feel.”
24 oz. gin 
12 oz. Aperol
64 oz. chilled sparkling rosé wine
Cranberries, for garnish
In a pitcher, combine the gin and Aperol. Stir and refrigerate until serving.
To serve, add the sparkling rosé wine and stir again gently. Pour into rocks glasses or cups and garnish with cranberries.

Title: Jones Doesn't Think Trump Should Resign, Vows to Be Independent - Bloomberg

Days after being elected in an upset in one of the reddest of states, Senator-elect Doug Jones had a message for his new colleagues: I’ll work with both parties.
The Alabama Democrat, whose long-shot candidacy was boosted by allegations of sexual misconduct against his Republican opponent, also said that President Donald Trump doesn’t need to resign, as some members of his party have urged.
“Don’t expect me to vote solidly for the Republicans or Democrats,” Jones, the first Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from Alabama in more than two decades, said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
“One of the problems in American politics right now, in my opinion, is that everybody thinks, because you’re a member of one party or another, you’re going to vote a certain way,” Jones said. “And that should not be the case.”
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and other Democrats in Congress have 
 for Trump to resign over allegations by at least 16 women that he engaged in sexual misconduct. Jones, who faced a Republican opponent in the Alabama race who was accused of inappropriate sexual contact with teenagers when he was in his 30s, echoed comments made by the Trump administration that the voters have spoken.
“Those allegations were made before the (2016) election, and so people had an opportunity to judge before that election,” Jones said when asked whether Trump should resign. “We need to move on and not get distracted by those issues. Let’s get on with the real issues that are facing the people of this country right now.”
The allegations against Moore turned the race for the Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ old seat into a national drama at a moment when the U.S. is dealing with revelations of sexual harassment from Hollywood to Washington. Jones’ win cut into Republicans’ narrow majority in the 100-seat chamber.
Moore has refused to concede defeat, and instead is asking supporters to donate to an “election integrity fund” to root out what he says -- without providing evidence -- is voter fraud. Jones said Sunday that “it’s time to vote on. Alabama has spoken,” and that he’s starting assembling his Senate staff.
Jones’ positions on various issues remain less known, particularly outside of his home state. His appearance on two talk shows Sunday morning gave him a chance to introduce himself to a national audience.
Congress is expected to vote this week on a conference committee measure overhauling the U.S. tax code; Jones said he’s concerned the bill has been rushed through without adequate chance for review. On “Fox News Sunday” Jones said he doesn’t think the bill will produce enough economic growth to pay for itself.
Jones also said on Fox that he supports extending deportation protection for 800,000 young undocumented immigrants covered by Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. He opposes Trump’s call to build a wall on the southern U.S. border as an expense that taxpayers don’t need to incur, he said
The incoming Alabama senator said on CNN that he supports Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and rejected complaints from some Republicans that there is bias against Trump.
“I don’t see any taint at this point,” Jones said.
The 63-year-old Democrat was the lead prosecutor in the 2002 conviction of two Ku Klux Klan members for the 1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. The bombing killed four girls and injured 22 others.
Jones spent the final days of the race shoring up support among blacks, the core of Alabama’s Democratic base, by campaigning with Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and civil rights leader, among others. Jones also sought support from moderate Republicans who found Moore too controversial,

Title: Americans’ Nest Eggs Have Never Been Bigger - Bloomberg

As U.S. stocks continue hitting new highs, President Donald Trump is encouraging Americans to check out their retirement accounts.
“Look at your 401-k’s since Election,” the president tweeted Monday morning. “Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back!”
Indeed, equity market gains have pushed average IRA and 401(k) balances to record levels. Unfortunately, there’s nothing to see for about half of American households that have no such retirement-savings vehicles.
Fidelity Investments, the nation’s largest administrator of retirement plans, 
 the average 401(k) balance in its accounts hit a record $99,900 in the third quarter while the average IRA rose to an all-time high of $103,500. Balances increased 10 percent from the same period a year ago, according to the Boston-based investment firm.
While the stock-market rally is welcome news for retirement investors, Federal Reserve data show that only about half of U.S. households have any skin in the game to begin with.
The share of families with retirement accounts, including IRAs and 401(k) plans, rose to 52.1 percent in 2016, from 49.2 percent in 2013, but still below its pre-recession level of 53 percent, according to the Fed’s most recent 
.
What’s more, just over 11 percent of Americans in the bottom fifth of the earnings distribution held retirement accounts last year, compared with over 90 percent of households in the top decile.

Title: Putin Thanks Trump for CIA Warning That Thwarted Bomb Plot - Bloomberg

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Donald Trump for the second time in four days, this time to thank the president for Central Intelligence Agency information that lead to the breakup of a suspected Islamic State cell.
The information helped disrupt a group that had been planning to blow up Kazan Cathedral and other locations around St. Petersburg, according to a Kremlin statement on Sunday. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed the conversation on Twitter and in a statement.
Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, arrested seven suspected followers of the Islamic State who were planning a suicide bombing and other attacks in Russia’s second-largest city, the security agency 
 on its website Friday.
Trump told Putin he appreciated the call and stressed the importance of international cooperation in intelligence matters, the White House said in its readout of the conversation.  Putin also thanked the CIA, and Trump called Director Mike Pompeo following his conversation with Putin to congratulate him, the White House said. 
“Both leaders agreed that this serves as an example of the positive things that can occur when our countries work together,” the White House said in the readout. 
Russia initiated Sunday’s conversation. The 
, on Dec. 14, was made by Washington. Trump used it to thank Putin for “acknowledging America’s strong economic performance” during the Russian leader’s annual press conference earlier in the day. They talked about North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, as well as other bilateral issues, according to the Kremlin.

Title: The Best Food and Restaurants at Disney World, Orlando, Fla. - Bloomberg

Let’s count the reasons visitors flock to Orlando. There are the endless theme parks, the sprawling convention center, the abundance of world-class golf courses nearby, and proximity to the Kennedy Space Center. Whatever the reason you might go, you’ve got a lot of company: In 2016, 68 million visitors descended upon the area, spending $41.8 billion on lodging, entertainment, and dining, making it the top tourist destination in the U.S.
On a recent visit, I went for a less obvious purpose: to eat. As a food and drink writer, and the 
, I was not optimistic about what I would encounter—I anticipated a lot of Mickey Mouse-shaped pancakes and candy apples. 
I was wrong to be concerned. In and around the Magic Kingdom, I found first-rate homey Italian fare and an artisanal cocktail spot with thoughtful Southern dishes. Best of all, I discovered a destination sushi counter, manned by rising stars who have big plans for the future. And that’s just what’s there now; coming to Orlando in 2018 are restaurants from chefs Jose Andres and Wolfgang Puck and a wine bar by noted sommelier George Miliotes.
Here are my favorite finds.
Inside an unremarkable-looking black box of a building in Orlando’s Audubon Park Garden district, the three young, ambitious chef-owners of 
 deliver a smart, intimate, and fun sushi 
 experience to customers arrayed around a nine-seat counter. Most of the fish served at Kadence is shipped twice weekly from Japan, and those imports are supplemented with regional seafood. Highlights of a recent 10-course lunch ($55, including tax and gratuity) included kampachi with seaweed salt, o-toro with sea urchin miso, a dark, fish stock-fortified miso soup, and a delicate cheesecake flavored with yuzu. All these careful dishes were prepared and consumed against an upbeat soundtrack of hip-hop and rock, with friendly strangers sharing pours from their outsize sake bottles. Dinner ($145) can run to 18 courses.
Having previously operated a sushi stand, Kappo, in nearby East End Market, chefs Lordfer Lalicon, Jennifer Bañagale, and Mark V. Berdin bring a wealth of experience and training to the Orlando dining scene. Lalicon is an alum of New York’s Carbone, Blue Hill and Blue Hill Stone Barns, and the Oak Room. Bañagale is an Oak Room alum who also worked at Aquavit, and Morton’s and Umu in London, where she was head pastry chef. And Berdin learned his sushi skills at Morimoto and 15 East in New York and rounded out his Japanese training at Umu.
The trio plans to expand into an adjacent space in the next year or so and will offer menus with a combination of raw and cooked dishes. Walk-ins are accepted at certain times, while others require reservations, via the prepaid Tock ticketing system. 
Situated in a quiet corner on the ground floor of the J.W. Marriott Grande Lakes, 
 is the second outpost of the Italian farm-to-table restaurant originally established in Rockland, Maine, by celebrated chef Melissa Kelly. Using organic ingredients, many sourced from an on-site garden, the chefs create solid, hearty Italian favorites such as seared gnocchi with fried sage ($17 for a half-portion, $30 for full) and a short list of wood-fired pizzas ($18-22). The pork saltimbocca with a mushroom-Madeira jus ($34) is based on Kelly’s grandfather’s recipe. The room is warm and comfortable, the service is polished and friendly. The Tuscany-intensive wine list offers plenty of food-friendly matches. 
Named for a picturesque vantage point in Yosemite National Park, 
 is a Disney fine-dining sleeper hit. Located within Disney’s Wilderness Lodge hotel, the soaring space with an American West theme is as family-friendly as any Disney restaurant but somehow quieter and more serene than most. The menu is heavily influenced by the ingredients and sensibilities of the Pacific Northwest: A recent amuse-bouche featured Washington apple and Oregon cheddar and marionberry jam. Slow-roasted buffalo strip steak ($52) and Chinook cedar-planked salmon ($47) are among the signature entrees. There are also several steakhouse cuts of beef available, including an aged bone-in ribeye and on-trend accompaniments such as roasted bone marrow, charred shishito peppers, and chimichurri sauce. Selections from top Pacific Northwest producers such as Argyle, Pacific Rim, and L’Ecole No. 41 populate the wine list. Among the standout desserts is a petite seasonal milkshake (recently pumpkin-flavored, $11) that accompanies four compulsively delicious almond butter cookies. 
You may not expect “hand-crafted, artisanal” anything as you survey your Disney-adjacent dining and drinking options, but 
 has fashionably collated the current vogue for farm-to-table dining into a rustically elegant space at the Ritz-Carlton Grande Lakes. Cocktails ($12-$24) are made with house-infused liquors (such as bourbon steeped with lavender and spiced honey) and embellished syrups and poured over custom ice cubes embedded with fruit and herbs. The food, generously proportioned and seasoned, is firmly rooted in the South, and the local farms listed on the menu provide much of the kitchen’s produce, meat, and eggs. Standouts include “Southern Spread” ($18), a shareable appetizer that includes pimiento cheese, smoked wahoo, and pickled vegetables, and almond milk-braised pork belly. Don’t miss the desserts ($10-$12), which include seasonal fruit cobblers, house-made donuts, and Key Lime tarts with orange-blossom meringue and pickled watermelon. 
If a Disney character breakfast is a nonnegotiable part of your family travel plans, make sure it’s the Good Morning Breakfast with Goofy and his Pals at 
, the large, airy Italian restaurant on the ground floor of the lavish Four Seasons Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort. The extensive brunch menu includes freshly baked pastries, beef brisket hash, lemon ricotta pancakes with limoncello whipped cream, excellent strong coffee, and properly mixed Bloody Marys. In the evenings, chef Fabrizio Schenardi presides over a well-executed seasonal Italian menu of wood-fired pizzas and pastas. Ravello’s California-intensive wine list also contains plenty of Tuscan and Piedmont reds, a nice list of Bordeaux and Burgundy and Champagnes, and greatest hits from Oregon, New Zealand, and Spain. Complimentary photos with the visiting Disney characters (via digital download) are included in the cost of brunch ($46 adults, $24 kids ages 3–12). 
OK, so you want something casual? Mother-daughter-son team Lana, Taissa, and Phillip Rebroff began selling their sweet and savory hand pies and galettes at local farmer’s markets in 2014 and moved to 
 in Winter Park in 2016. Phillip, a veteran chef and Johnson & Wales alum, handles the savory menu, which includes roasted beet and deviled egg tartines ($10) and a roasted vegetable cassoulet. Lana and Taissa produce gorgeous pies and 
, including a sweet, substantial apple pie and moist oversize S’more cookies. 
“Real Talk: gigantic burritos with a slab of sour cream and fountain sodas aren’t our gig,” reads the disclaimer on 
’s website. The gig at this taqueria, in the centrally located Mills50 business improvement district, is tacos ($3.25–$4.75). The handmade tortillas are wrapped around tender achiote pork shoulder, seared carne asada, crisp-fried fish, and a deceptively meaty-tasting combination of smoked greens, shiitake mushrooms, and plantains. Made-to-order guacamole ($6), ceviche ($9), meatball sopes ($3), and braised meat bowls ($10.50) garnished with vegetables, herbs, and bright salsas round out the appealing menu, which also includes agua frescas, Jarritos Mexican sodas, draft and bottled beer, and wine by the glass.
Open for just a few weeks, 
, a cashless café in Winter Park, takes its name from the Depression-era glass cake knives collected by owner Steve Brown’s mother Jacque, a passionate hobbyist baker. Under the direction of chef Stuart Whitfield, previously of Le Cirque and Four Seasons, the shop offers whole cakes (prices vary) and cake by the slice ($8), including a silky red velvet, savory offerings such as chicken pot pie ($9) and roasted tomato cheese soup ($6), craft coffee from Arkansas’s Onyx Coffee Lab, and a display of Jacque’s knives in the communal center table.

Title: Puerto Rico’s Slow Hurricane Recovery Is Suffocating Small Business - Bloomberg

This fall’s hurricane season has been rough on Jesús Vázquez’s family business outside San Juan. Their 35-year-old ice factory and adjacent laundromat hasn’t had power since Hurricane Irma, which hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 6, two weeks before Hurricane Maria devastated the island. And the family’s rental property business is losing roughly $35,000 a month, because it’s not charging rent to tenants who lack power, lost their jobs, or can’t reopen their own businesses.
Vázquez says he’s spending three times as much on diesel generators as he did on electricity from the island’s bankrupt power utility, the 
 (Prepa). Most of his clients are small—convenience stores, restaurants, bars—and many haven’t reopened. “The ideal word to describe the overall situation is ‘catastrophic,’ ” he says. More than two months since Maria, “you realize things are not improving, particularly for small businesses.”
Delays in restoring and running power consistently—Prepa’s generation capacity is only around 68 percent—are undermining Puerto Rico’s entrepreneurs. Business conditions have been bad for years, a result of a decade-long recession, which spurred significant migration away from the island. As many as 470,000 Puerto Ricans may move to the mainland through 2019, according to a report by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York, because of Maria’s destruction. In early December a federal judge canceled plans to bring Puerto Rico’s $74 billion bankruptcy case back to the island because of hotel closures.
Nelson Ramírez, president of the Centro Unido de Detallistas (CUD), a small-business advocacy group in San Juan, estimates two-thirds of the island’s roughly 45,000 small and midsize businesses have closed temporarily. “Our conservative estimate was 5,000 businesses wouldn’t ever reopen,” Ramírez says. “But it could easily reach 10,000.” Permanent closures could hit 40 percent, says Arnaldo Cruz, director of research and analytics at the nonprofit Foundation for Puerto Rico. “The Puerto Rico government has very bad economic data, even before Maria, so we won’t get accurate official reports for a while,” he says.
Small and midsize businesses represent 90 percent of private companies on the island and about one-third of the workforce, according to data released last year by the commonwealth government’s Puerto Rico Trade and Export Co. The fallout from this year’s hurricanes is already apparent: U.S. Department of Labor figures show employers cut payrolls the most in 21 years in October and unemployment claims surged to an 11-year high in November.
“Business owners say the situation is dire,” says Ramírez. “When they close and lay off their workers, it becomes a vicious cycle, because those people don’t buy things, the economy weakens, and people leave the island.”
Carla López de Azúa, who rents spaces to artisans and restaurateurs in her 8,000-square-foot market in San Juan’s Santurce area, is committed to the island’s recovery, even though half her tenants left after the power failed and economic indicators turned grim. Supermarket prices, for example, have “skyrocketed,” she says. “I know people who don’t know what they are going to feed their kids.”
Since her power returned in late November, she’s been trying to lure back tenants who shut their businesses. Puerto Rico’s economic difficulty isn’t new, López de Azúa says. Many of her renters lost their jobs during the most recent recession and reinvented themselves as entrepreneurs. After Maria, some left for the U.S. mainland. “It’s important for them to know they can come back and make a living,” she says.
Restoring, then improving, the power grid is priority No. 1 for the island’s recovery. “Infrastructure has to work,” says Cruz of the Foundation for Puerto Rico, noting that a lot of the island still has no consistent power. Once businesses are back on the grid, you will see “economic recovery really, really accelerate,” says Rob Glenn, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s private-sector division director.
The Small Business Administration is offering low-interest business loans of up to $2 million to owners in Puerto Rico affected by Maria. Of the 3,533 applications received as of Dec. 5, the agency has approved only 50 loans totaling $6.2 million. “This is the early phase of the small business recovery,” agency spokeswoman Carol Chastang wrote in an email. “Loan approvals will increase in the coming days.” She notes the deadline has been extended to March 20. Cruz says many Puerto Rican entrepreneurs won’t apply for the loans if they’re not sure they’ll have enough clients to keep their businesses running.
Some, like Ignacio Pino, who runs biotech startup 
 in an industrial park in Mayaguez, are cautiously optimistic. Even though CDI has lost about $400,000 since Maria, the business is in a better position than most because it doesn’t depend on local customers. It ships its proteins to hospital research labs and other clients on the mainland. “It’s going to be hell, but I think we’ll make it,” Pino says. As a Plan B, his team is scouting locations in the states that lure biotech companies with incentives. He’s trying to raise expansion capital but worries investors won’t want to risk their money on a small company in Puerto Rico.
Betting a small cash infusion can help, the Foundation for Puerto Rico has raised almost $600,000 to give in $5,000 allotments to entrepreneurs in commercial districts it’s trying to revive, says Cruz. The Puerto Rico Trade and Export Co. in mid-November started a $200,000 program awarding grants of up to $1,000 to businesses affected by the hurricanes. Executive Director Ricardo Llerandi acknowledges the donations available aren’t nearly enough. Many businesses won’t survive, but a year from now, he predicts, new entrepreneurs will have cropped up in their place. Says Llerandi: “There’s a spirit of, I’ll create my own job instead of asking someone for a job.”

Title: Goldman's Abby Cohen Says Trump Rally Isn't Actually About Trump - Bloomberg

Don’t tell Donald Trump, but the stock market’s record highs may have little to do with his presidency.
Today’s equity prices reflect a typical election pattern: the stock market pulls back ahead of an election only to rise in the months following, said Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs & Co.’s senior investment strategist.
“Regardless of the election outcome, there would have been a noteworthy rise,” Cohen said in an interview broadcast Sunday on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” program.
The S&P 500 closed Dec. 15 at a record 2675.81, a 25 percent increase since last year’s presidential election. Coupled with traditional post-election patterns, improving economic activity, a trend that started before the election, could also be accelerating gains, Cohen said.
Trump has tweeted about record closes in the stock market at least six times since July, most recently on Dec. 15. “Look at your 401-K’s since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER!” he

Title: Disney Buys Fox Assets in $52 Billion Split of Murdoch Realm - Bloomberg

Walt Disney Co. agreed to a $52.4 billion deal to acquire much of the global empire that media baron 
 assembled over three decades, from a fabled Hollywood studio to Europe’s largest satellite-TV provider to one of India’s most-watched channels.
Holders of Murdoch’s 
 will get 0.2745 Disney share for each Fox share, for assets including the movie and TV production house, a 39 percent stake in 
, Star India, and a lineup of pay-TV channels that include FX and National Geographic, the companies said in statements Thursday. The price amounts to about $29.54 a share, based on Disney’s closing price Wednesday. Both companies’ stocks slipped in early trading.
Via a spinoff, the mogul will continue to run Fox News Channel, the FS1 sports network and the Fox broadcast network in the U.S. Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger will remain in his role through 2021, the companies said. Fox plans to complete its planned acquisition of the 61 percent of European broadcaster Sky that it doesn’t already own, which will wind up in Disney’s hands.
The sale marks an epic downsizing for Murdoch, an 86-year-old former Australian who spent his adult life amassing the assets that made him a kingmaker in U.S. and U.K. politics. Iger said Thursday he’ll discuss a possible role at Disney with Murdoch’s son James, Fox’s CEO, after he completes work on the merger transition. If Disney does offer the 45-year-old Murdoch a job, he could vie to succeed Iger, 66.
“This is the end of an era for the Murdochs, who after 30 years of aggressive empire expansion are now in retreat,” said Tom Watson, deputy leader of the U.K. Labour Party. Watson played a pivotal role in the campaign against phone-hacking campaign at Murdoch’s newspapers in 2011, which scuttled his first attempt to take control of Sky.
Disney will also assume about $13.7 billion of net debt from Fox. The deal will give Disney $2 billion of cost savings and start adding to earnings two years after the takeover is complete. The deal will close in 12 to 18 months, Disney said.
Disney beat out rival bidder Comcast Corp. for the Fox assets in a deal brought on by dramatic changes in the media landscape. The rise of alternative forms of online entertainment, from Netflix to Snapchat, have led millions of once-loyal pay-TV subscribers to cut the cord, forcing TV companies to band together to ensure their long-term survival. Discovery Communications Inc. agreed in July to acquire Scripps Networks Interactive Inc., and Time Warner Inc. is trying to sell itself to AT&T Inc.
The Justice Department has sued to block that AT&T deal, and Disney’s Fox transaction is also likely to receive heavy regulatory scrutiny by bringing so many media assets under one roof. Disney, the owner of ESPN, is acquiring regional Fox networks that air local basketball and baseball games, giving the company an unprecedented amount of rights to sports programming. Buying Fox’s movie studio will give Disney the rights to make movies based on the X-Men comic books, adding to an already stocked cabinet of superheroes such as Iron Man and Thor.
Shares of New York-based Fox fell 2.3 percent to $32 in early trading, reflecting investor concern that the deal could get blocked by regulators. Disney’s offer values all of Fox, including the parts that will be spun off and remain under the Murdochs’ control, at about $40 a share, a person familiar with the matter said this week.
“They have done the best deal they could,” Claire Enders, founder of media research firm Enders Analysis, said of Fox. “They don’t need any money. They want to have higher-quality assets and they’re going to have a very substantial shareholding in a much better set of assets that fit better.”
Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 1 percent to $106.58. The company said it will buy back $10 billion in stock to offset dilution from the deal.
In recent years, the elder Murdoch has handed off management of 21st Century Fox to his sons, James and Lachlan, 46, who shares the title of executive chairman with his father. The legendary media mogul is also the largest shareholder in News Corp., a separate company that owns publishing operations including the Wall Street Journal.
Until recently, the Murdochs had given no indication they were sellers, as evidenced by their continued pursuit of full ownership of Sky, with an offer of $15.3 billion for the shares it doesn’t already own.
That facade was shattered last month with the 
 that Disney had discussed acquiring the Fox assets. Fox instantly drew other suitors, all of which realized a sale of the Fox properties represented a rare opportunity to take out a competitor. Comcast -- the cable giant that owns NBCUniversal -- 
 and Sony Corp. all expressed interest in parts of the company.
Sky shares fell as much as 2.8 percent Thursday in London, given the risk that Fox’s bid for the pay-TV company could fail, leaving the satellite provider’s fate uncertain.
Disney said it doesn’t expect that buying Fox’s existing 39 percent stake in Sky should trigger a mandatory offer for the rest, according to a statement from the U.K. Takeover Panel. That contradicts most interpretations of Britain’s takeover rules, which specify that an offer is mandatory if someone acquires 30 percent of more of shares carrying voting rights. Still, Disney’s stance puts pressure on the U.K. government to go ahead and approve Fox’s bid since it’s on the table.
If Fox’s pursuit of Sky control is approved in the U.K. and Disney eventually takes possession of the satellite provider, Iger’s company will have a direct relationship with pay-TV customers in five countries in Europe.
That’s part of the Disney CEO’s plan to draw his company closer to consumers in the digital age, a strategy that also includes introducing an ESPN subscription app next year and a Disney TV and movies app in 2019. Now that latter product might be populated by X-Men and the Simpsons along with Mickey Mouse and Iron Man.

Title: A Disney Deal for Fox Is Coming Within Days - Bloomberg

 may announce a deal as soon as this week to acquire a large piece of 
, according to a person familiar with the matter, transferring legendary Hollywood properties to new owners.
Comcast Corp., the other major contender for the Fox assets, said Monday it’s no longer in the running.
A trust belonging to Fox Executive Chairman 
 and his family would end up with a small stake in Disney in the transaction, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Disney would acquire Fox’s movie and TV studio, networks including FX and National Geographic, and international assets including Star India’s TV channels and a 39 percent stake in European satellite provider Sky Plc. Disney would also get Fox’s stake in U.S. streaming-video provider Hulu, doubling its ownership to 60 percent.
21st Century Fox would keep Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1. The company would remain independent at least initially, though it could consider a merger later with the Murdochs’ publishing company, News Corp., the person said. Fox Chief Executive Officer James Murdoch is likely to be offered a senior position at Disney after the transaction closes, the person said. That would put him in the running as a candidate to eventually succeed Disney CEO Bob Iger.
The talks between Disney and Fox, which began more than two months ago, will unite two giants of the entertainment industry and mark a significant turning point for Rupert Murdoch, the mogul who has spent the past seven decades assembling a media empire. A deal will still face regulatory scrutiny in Washington, where the U.S. Justice Department has sued to block another proposed media megamerger between AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc.
A deal still hasn’t been finalized, and the talks could fall apart. Fox shares 
 1.1 percent to $33.66 at the close in New York. Burbank, California-based Disney 
 2.5 percent to $106.83. Philadephia-based Comcast added 1.5 percent in late trading after announcing it’s no longer pursuing the assets, and Sky was 
 at 1,000 pence at 9:38 a.m. in London.
“When a set of assets like 21st Century Fox’s becomes available, it’s our responsibility to evaluate if there’s a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” the cable giant said in a statement. “That’s what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.”
In addition to Comcast, Verizon Communications Inc. and Sony Corp. have also explored the idea of acquiring the holdings. Fox’s studio would give Disney the rights to popular characters such as the X-Men and the Simpsons, and could let the company cut costs by combining two giant Hollywood operations. The Sky stake would 
 Disney 22.5 million customers in five countries in Europe, with leading advertising technology, and Disney would be likely to seek full control of the satellite provider.
Assuming Disney acquires the Fox assets in a stock-based deal, Fox shareholders would end up with about 25 percent of Disney, according to Rosenblatt Securities Inc. The Murdoch family trust holds an economic interest of about 16 percent in New York-based Fox, which would translate to a stake of roughly 5 percent in Disney, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
With speculation mounting that a deal was in the works, the Murdochs -- Rupert and his sons Lachlan and James -- sent a memo to employees late last week.
“We want to address the headlines about us possibly talking to other companies about a potential transaction,” the Murdochs said in the Dec. 7 email. “While we can’t comment on market speculation, we do want to address the impact we know this is having on all of you. Uncertainty always breeds unease. In every way, our focus is on our businesses and on the welfare of all our colleagues.”

Title: Three More Great Reasons to Go to Cape Town Right Away - Bloomberg

No stranger to tourists, Cape Town has ­typically staked its reputation on being an adventure capital more than an arts center. The city’s natural beauty draws even the laziest of travelers on hikes up Table Mountain, to penguin-packed beaches sheltered by rocky coves, and across the rolling hills of 200 nearby vineyards.
But change is afoot in the Mother City. I was living here in 2014, when it was dubbed a World Design Capital, and I witnessed the emergence of a local cultural scene. The Central Business District and once-gritty Woodstock area were then morphing into art hubs brimming with studios and world-class galleries such as Stevenson, Gallery Momo, and Whatiftheworld. Even outside the city, vineyards like Leeu Estates, Le Quartier Français, and Delaire Graff Estate are now showcasing homegrown artistic talents.
This long-simmering creativity came to a boil in September when philanthropist and ex-Puma Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz opened the 500 million-rand ($36 million) 
. The German businessman has been a passionate collector of art from the African continent and diaspora for a decade, painstakingly amassing a ­collection—rumored to include more than 1,000 works—that ranges from Zimbabwean political commentary and African American pop art to Tunisian photography.
Previously, the only way to see part of his collection was to pay upwards of $1,800 per night to sleep among a handful of special pieces at his Segera Retreat safari camp in Kenya. The 100,000-square-foot museum does more than bring the collection to the masses; it gives the city its own version of London’s Tate or New York’s Whitney Museum and cements Cape Town as a bona fide global art capital. On a continent loaded with imagination and talent, the vanguard is right here.
The building itself is a marvel. Thomas Heatherwick—the British architect behind 
, and King’s Cross in London—has transformed an abandoned 1920s-era grain silo into a concrete cathedral to creativity. Inside is an airy, almost diaphanous atrium that Heatherwick carved out of the factory’s 42 hulking cylinders. Suspended from the ceiling is Nicholas Hlobo’s haunting 
 (“All the Lightning Birds Are After Me”), a dragon made from rubber inner tubing that references South African Xhosa mythology.
A wander through the 80 galleries that circle the building’s light-filled atrium will reveal nebulous cowhide sculptures by Swaziland-born Nandipha Mntambo, portraits featuring intricate spectacles fashioned from trash that Kenyan artist Cyrus Kabiru collects on the streets of Nairobi, and textured canvases layered with sari fabrics by Madagascan Joël Andrianomearisoa.
The neighborhood around the museum, rechristened the Silo precinct, is changing more than its name. Until recently it was nothing more than a barren stretch adjacent to the Victoria & Albert Waterfront—a glossy-but-bland shopping plaza that draws more tourists than the Egyptian pyramids. Now tenants include edgy accessories designer 
; 
, who makes extraordinary ostrich bags and python clutches; and 
, a showcase for South African furniture. Meanwhile, 
and other restaurants are bringing locals to an area they once avoided the way New Yorkers bypass Times Square.
Conveniently perched above the museum is Cape Town’s best new place to stay. 
 is anchored by geodesic windows that bulge out of the 28 rooms and look onto Table Mountain. (Guests are currently being asked to avoid soaking in its decadent baths, because of a local water shortage.) Surveying the landscape from my suite, I thought about how easy it would be to assume that this progress all resulted from the Zeitz Mocaa, but the opposite is true: The museum is merely a reflection of the city’s momentum.
 
At the heart of Cape Town’s revitalized Central Business District, Bree Street has become a magnet for stylish shoppers— in addition to its long-standing coterie of culinary pilgrims.
A stern, charcoal-colored facade belies what you’ll find inside: 
 in a kaleidoscope of hues and shapes. 
This boutique brings 
 under one petite roof, with leather brogues from Aya Goods, laser-cut dresses by Isabel de Villiers, and Black Betty’s citrine and quartz rings. 
The first city outpost of this award-winning 
, it’s one of Cape Town’s best pick-me-ups. 
Find minimalist fashion—long denim coats and plaid shirtdresses—at Swedish transplant Höjer’s 
, set in a former stable. 
The 
 has spiced up homes and hotels across South Africa, Zanzibar, and the UAE; his eclectic showroom stocks fantasy-style photography by Athi-Patra Ruga and sculptural clay vessels by Louise Gelderblom. 
Famished? Skip the seafood on the Waterfront and come here for 
with 
 corn salsa. 
 
Less than an hour away from Cape Town is the Winelands hamlet of Franschhoek, with its gabled Cape Dutch-style buildings, stuck-in-time churches, and now, one of the world’s best tasting rooms. There, you can swirl and sip funky syrahs and chenin blancs by 
, named 
’s 2016 Winemaker of the Year. Her family’s bottles are the focus of the tobacco-toned studio at Leeu Estates, a year-old,
. (Try the Passant Stellenbosch chardonnay; it’s popular for its balanced peach and pear notes.) For dinner, a new destination restaurant has cropped up on nearby Huguenot Street: 
, a spinoff of a similarly named fine-dining stalwart in Cape Town, offers unexpected flavor combinations such as linefish with smoked parsnip, pancetta, and buckwheat.

Title: CVS to Buy Aetna for $67.5 Billion, Remaking Health Sector - Bloomberg

 will buy Aetna Inc. for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.
CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies 
 Sunday. That’s a 29 percent premium to Aetna’s share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.
The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna’s 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna’s insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.
Including CVS’s assumption of Aetna’s debt, the deal will be valued at $77 billion, the companies said in the statement. It’s expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.
In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.
The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling “10,000 new front doors for the health-care system’’ at CVS’s stores and clinics.
“Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,’’ Merlo said in the joint interview. “We’re bringing health care to where people live and work.’’
The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the companies said.
CVS and Aetna are joining hands as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com Inc., and how the Internet retailer could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn’t revealed its plans.
“One of the problems with the health-care system is it’s so fragmented and there’s so little coordination,” said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. “A better vertically integrated, less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.”
Merlo, the chief executive of CVS, disputed the idea that the deal was a defensive move against Amazon’s possible entry into the pharmacy business.
“This transaction is really about growth, it is about expansion, it is not about contraction,” Merlo said. 
The deal could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna’s competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, Express Scripts Holding Co.’s top executive said the company would be 
, though wasn’t actively looking for one.
“We don’t need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,” Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on an online-pharmacy arrangement.
Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. 
WellCare Health Plans Inc., Humana Inc. and Centene Corp. could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health Inc. or McKesson Corp., and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. could also face pressure to find partners.
CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond its drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx -- a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company’s operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS 
 selling cigarettes and added “Health” to its name.
The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group Inc., is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015.
Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers -- including a deal between Aetna and Humana Inc. -- were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers for potential deals.
The CVS-Aetna deal’s antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of tie-ups among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc., a vertical deal.
Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.
In the joint interview, the CVS and Aetna executives declined to comment on whether they might have to divest parts of the Medicare drug business. But Bertolini said the companies are prepared to work with regulators to do what it takes to get the deal approved.
“We are obviously going to get some scrutiny. We are prepared to deal with whatever comes along to make this work,” said Bertolini.

Title: Trump Says He's Not Considering Firing Special Counsel Mueller - Bloomberg

President Donald Trump said Sunday that he’s not considering firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
Trump made the comment in response to a reporter’s shouted question after returning to the White House from Camp David. He spoke on the same day that John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, came to the defense of Mueller, saying it “would be a mistake” for Trump to fire the special counsel, even as many GOP lawmakers ramp up criticism of his probe.
Cornyn’s comments on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday came as a handful of congressional Republicans have 
 for Mueller’s firing. Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, 
 in a radio interview on Friday that the “rumor” sweeping the Capitol was that Trump plans to fire Mueller on Dec. 22.
Trump’s lawyer, Ty Cobb, has denied the claim. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short both pushed back Sunday on the notion that Trump was discussing a firing.
“There’s no conversation about that whatsoever in the White House,” Short said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
“I haven’t heard anything about this, any firing,” 
 on CNN’s “State of the Union,” adding that it was “obviously up to” Trump to make a final decision.
Some Republican lawmakers have ramped up their criticism of Mueller and the staff working on the investigation. Trump, too, has seized on some of these questions, writing on Twitter that the FBI’s reputation is “in tatters.”
“The public trust in this whole thing is gone,” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio said Dec. 13 during a House Judiciary Committee appearance by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller. During the hearing Rosenstein 
 and said the investigation “is not a witch hunt.”
Cornyn said that he has confidence in Mueller, the former FBI director who was named in May to lead a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Still, he joined many of his Republicans colleagues in casting doubt on the integrity of the investigation, repeating that Mueller should “eliminate” team members who had supported Democrats or were critical of Trump.
“I would just think he would be concerned about the appearance of conflicts of interest that would undermine the integrity of the investigation,” Cornyn said.
Mueller recently 
an FBI official from the investigation as soon as his anti-Trump text messages were discovered. The recipient of the texts, who was also on Mueller’s team, had left by the time the exchanges were discovered.
“Mueller needs to clean house of partisans,” Cornyn said Saturday in a 
to a Bloomberg reporter.
On Saturday, a lawyer for Trump’s presidential transition complained in a letter to two congressional committees about what he described as the “unlawful production” of tens of thousands of transitions emails to Mueller’s team by employees at the federal General Services Administration.
Some of the materials are “susceptible to claims of privilege,” the lawyer, Kory Langhofer, said in the letter.
Mueller’s office defended the way the emails were the obtained.
“When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner’s consent or appropriate criminal process,” Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel’s office, said in a statement to the New York Times and other outlets.
Doug Jones, the federal prosecutor and Democratic Senator-elect from Alabama, said he’s confident the investigation is proceeding without bias and termed Mueller a “consummate professional.”
“I would be very surprised if Bob Mueller did anything that illegally obtained or anything like that,” Jones said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, days after his upset win over Republican Roy Moore.
Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that “it’s serious any time you have an investigator within an investigation that has an obvious political bias whichever direction that goes.”
He added of the presence of an official critical of Trump, “I don’t think it taints the entire process. But it certainly taints that season of it.”

Title: Apple, Google CEOs Bring Star Power as China Promotes Censorship - Bloomberg

Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook and Google’s Sundar Pichai made their first appearances at China’s World Internet Conference, bringing star power to a gathbering the Chinese government uses to promote its strategy of tight controls online.
Apple’s chief executive officer gave a surprise keynote at the opening ceremony on Sunday, calling for future internet and AI technologies to be infused with privacy, security and humanity. The same day, one of China’s most-senior officials called for more aggressive government involvement online to combat terrorism and criminals. Wang Huning, one of seven men on China’s top decision-making body, even called for a global response team to go well beyond its borders.
It was Cook’s second appearance in China in two months, following a meeting with President Xi Jinping in October. The iPhone maker has most of its products manufactured in the country and is trying to regain market share in smartphones against local competitors such as Huawei Technologies Co.
“The theme of this conference -- developing a digital economy for openness and shared benefits -- is a vision we at 
 share,” Cook said. “We are proud to have worked alongside many of our partners in China to help build a community that will join a common future in cyberspace."
The Wuzhen conference, which until this year has had a primarily local presence, is designed to globally promote the country’s vision of a more censored and controlled internet. The attendance of leaders from two of the world’s most valuable tech giants lends credibility to China’s efforts to influence the global internet so it better resembles its own.
“It is interesting to see Apple and Google at the WIC, but we doubt there will be any meaningful changes in China government policy,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research. “Current policies have worked very well so far: two of the top five internet companies in terms of market cap are Chinese -- supported by growth in consumer spending which is a key government priority.”
The two companies Boodry referred to participated in the conference, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Pony Ma taking part. The other technology executives in attendance included Cisco Systems Inc.’s Chuck Robbins and Baidu Inc. co-founder Robin Li.
Cook’s comments come at a pivotal point for the company’s future in China, which is now its biggest market outside of North America. It relies on the sale of hardware and services in the world’s most populous country to propel revenue and 
 growth. But the efforts required to stay in China’s good graces are causing tensions with civil libertarians and politicians at home.
He said Apple’s operations in the country began three decades ago with a handful of employees. Today, it helps support more than 5 million jobs in China, including 1.8 million local mobile app developers, he added.
Apple has come under fire for cooperating with Chinese authorities in removing apps that give users there uncensored communications. In November, Apple complied with government orders to pull Microsoft Corp.’s Skype phone and video service from the Chinese version of its popular app store. Cook used an earnings call with investors to justify such moves, saying it obeyed the laws of the markets where it operates.
“Much has been said of the potential downsides of AI, but I don’t worry about machines thinking like humans. I worry about people thinking like machines,” he said. “We all have to work to infuse technology with humanity, with our values.”
Technology of the future should have openness, creativity and safeguards to protect users while providing privacy and decency, he added.
It’s a goal that, according to Cook’s Chinese hosts, can only be accomplished through more laws and regulations that control what can be shared online. Wang, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, called for a global emergency response team that would respond in times of crisis using new and undetermined measures. China goes far beyond censoring content that could support terrorists and criminals. It also blocks Facebook, Twitter and many Western commercial and educational web sites.
“What we propose is we should promote a controllable security and build a new order,” Wang said through a translator. “Cybersecurity is a serious challenge. Cyber crimes and cyber terrorism have grown more rampant. The world’s destiny has become more intertwined in cyberspace.”
Unlike Cook, Google’s Pichai did not deliver a keynote speech and was instead on a panel to discuss the digital economy. The vast hall remained mostly empty for much of the session as a result of confusion among conference staff over when the session would begin.
Wuzhen holds special significance for the search giant, whose AI program defeated the world’s top-ranked player of the 
 at the same venue earlier this year -- a point Pichai alluded to as he promoted the company’s kit of AI software tools called 
.
“There are many small and medium businesses in China who take advantage of Google to get their products to many other countries outside of China,” he said. “Technology is giving opportunities at a global scale, driving interconnectedness and cooperation and I think it’s a big trend and I think it’s almost irreversible at this point.”

Title: Bitcoin Proxy Stocks Surge in Cryptocurrency Feeding Frenzy - Bloomberg

Investors can’t seem to get enough of all things crypto.
A day after the successful start of bitcoin futures trading, companies often seen as a safer alternative to investing directly in the cryptocurrency are on a tear. Riot Blockchain Inc. surged 33 percent and the Bitcoin Investment Trust climbed 15 percent. Overstock.com Inc. and MGT Capital Investments Inc. also advanced.
The rallies follow a widespread selloff in the same equities in the run-up to the debut of bitcoin futures that investors speculated would reduce demand for proxies. So far, that hasn’t materialized, as Cboe World Markets Inc.’s successful start of the derivatives contracts has only heightened interest in virtually all crypto assets.
Ether and litecoin, the second and fourth biggest cryptocurrencies, 
 to records Tuesday on optimism that bitcoin futures will attract institutions to the fledgling market. Bitcoin spot prices fluctuated near $17,000, according to Bloomberg composite pricing.

Title: TD Ameritrade Will Start Offering Cboe Bitcoin Futures on Monday - Bloomberg

 will let its brokerage clients trade bitcoin futures starting on Monday, a week after they debuted.
Customers will gain access to the contracts offered by Cboe Global Markets Inc. To trade, they must have a minimum account balance of $25,000 and post margin -- or collateral -- that’s one and a half times higher than Cboe requires, according to a statement emailed Friday.
CME Group Inc. is introducing its own bitcoin futures on Dec. 17, but TD Ameritrade customers won’t immediately be able to trade those, the company said.
“Right now we are taking the same approach we did with the Cboe product, to wait and see how it goes,” said JB Mackenzie, managing director for futures trading at TD Ameritrade. “We want to watch that market open and become an orderly marketplace and see who the participants are in that marketplace. This is the same process we use with any new product. We want to see how the market reacts.”

Title: As Tesla Pursues Solar Profit, U.S. Residential Market Slumps - Bloomberg

Residential solar isn’t white-hot anymore. After a bumper 2015 and a solid 2016, the U.S. residential-solar market is poised to contract 13 percent this year, according to a report Thursday by GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Installers will add 2.27 gigawatts of residential solar this year, down from 2.6 gigawatts in 2016, GTM forecasts. That would be the first slump after 
.
The decline reflects a maturing market as companies that spent years chasing rapid growth are now increasingly 
. The shift also comes as pushback from utilities prompts key states including Arizona and California to revise incentive programs that have been important drivers of consumer demand.
The decline is “really a big deal,” Austin Perea, an analyst at GTM, said in an interview. “For a market nearing maturity, it’s hard to grow by leaps and bounds every year.”
There have been hints of a market-wide slowdown. The biggest U.S. rooftop-solar company -- Elon Musk’s 
 -- is 
 systems this year than its SolarCity unit did before it was acquired a year ago. 
 installations have been mostly flat in 2017. And while 
expects installations to grow 15 percent in 2017, that’s down from last year’s 
.
Tesla 
 this year as it works to integrate SolarCity, and is shifting its business to prioritize selling the systems after years 
.
“Tesla has been pivoting away from the growth-at-all costs model,” Perea said.
Residential installations in the third quarter fell 10 percent from the second quarter, according to GTM.
Total U.S. solar installations, comprising residential, commercial and utility-scale projects, were 51 percent lower than the same period in 2016. GTM said the decline is largely due to a surge in the second half of 2016, when developers were racing to complete projects to qualify for U.S. tax credits that were scheduled to expire last year (they were eventually extended).

Title: Bitcoin Futures Deliver Wild Ride as Debut Brings Rally, Halts - Bloomberg

Bitcoin has landed on Wall Street.
Futures on the world’s most popular cryptocurrency surged as much as 26 percent in their debut session on Cboe Global Markets Inc.’s exchange, triggering two temporary trading halts designed to calm the market. 
 dealers’ expectations, while traffic on Cboe’s website was so heavy that it caused delays and temporary outages. The website’s problems had no impact on trading systems, Cboe said. Bitcoin’s spot price rose.
“It is rare that you see something more volatile than bitcoin, but we found it: bitcoin futures,” said Zennon Kapron, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Kapronasia.
The launch of futures on a regulated exchange is a watershed for bitcoin, whose surge this year has captivated everyone from mom-and-pop speculators to Wall Street trading firms. The Cboe contracts, soon to be followed by similar 
 from CME Group Inc. and 
 Inc., should make it easier for mainstream investors to bet on the cryptocurrency’s rise or fall.
Bitcoin wagers have until now been mostly limited to venues with little or no oversight, deterring institutional money managers and exposing some users to the risk of hacks and market breakdowns. About 20 trading firms actively participated, Cboe Chairman Ed Tilly said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
Bitcoin futures expiring in January were 18 percent higher at $17,710 as of 12:25 p.m. in New York from an opening level of $15,000, on 3,561 contracts traded.
“It was smooth, and bitcoin traders don’t seem to be put off by futures,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst in London at online trading firm Oanda. “There was a fear that short selling would have an adverse impact on price, but we haven’t seen that yet.”
The spot price climbed 4.7 percent to $16,383 from the Friday 5 p.m. close in New York, according to the composite price on Bloomberg.
The roughly $1,300 difference reflects not only the novelty of the asset but also the difficulty of using the cash-settled futures to trade against the spot, strategists said.
“In a normal, functioning market, good old arbitrage would settle this,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Hellerup, Denmark, said by email. “If they were deliverable you could arbitrage the life out of it.”
Proponents of regulated bitcoin derivatives say the contracts will increase market transparency and boost liquidity, but skeptics abound. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a “fraud,” while China’s government has cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges this year. The Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- said this month that contracts in the U.S. were 
 without enough consideration of the risks.
So far though, trading has kicked off without any major hiccups.
Dealers said volume was high for a new contract, even though it was tiny relative to more established futures. And the trading halts took effect just as Cboe had outlined in its rules. Transactions stopped for two minutes after a 10 percent gain from the opening price, and for five minutes after a 20 percent jump. Another five-minute halt will take effect if the rally extends to 30 percent, Cboe said in a notice on its website.
“It was pretty easy to trade,” Joe Van Hecke, managing partner at Chicago-based Grace Hall Trading LLC, said in a telephone interview from Charlotte, North Carolina. “I think you’ll see a robust market as time plays out.”
For now, Cboe futures account for a tiny slice of the world’s bitcoin-related bets. The notional value of contracts traded in the first eight hours totaled about $40 million. Globally, about $1.1 billion of bitcoin traded against the U.S. dollar during the same period, according to Cryptocompare.com.
Some people who would like to trade futures are having a hard time accessing the market because not all brokers are supporting it initially, said Garrett See, chief executive officer of DV Chain. Participation may also be limited because of higher capital requirements and tighter risk limits, See said.
“We’re in the early stages here, and there’s not enough professional liquidity from the big market makers who can provide depth and hold in the movements,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp. “It’s going to be a learning curve.”
It’s been painful for investors stuck on the sidelines. This year alone, bitcoin is up more than 17-fold. The surge has been driven largely by demand from individuals, with technical obstacles keeping out most big money managers like mutual funds.
The new derivatives contracts should thrust bitcoin more squarely into the realm of regulators, banks and institutional investors. Both Cboe and CME on Dec. 1 got permission to offer the contracts after pledging to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the products don’t run afoul of the law, in a process called self-certification.
Not everyone is happy with the roll out. Exchanges failed to get enough feedback from market participants on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests and clearing, the Futures Industry Association said this month. In November, Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire chairman of Interactive Brokers Group Inc., wrote an open letter to CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, arguing that bitcoin’s large price swings mean its futures contracts shouldn’t be allowed on platforms that clear other derivatives.
Still, Interactive Brokers is offering its customers access to the futures, with greater restrictions. The firm’s clients won’t be able to go short, and Interactive’s margin requirement, or how much investors have to set aside as collateral, will be at least 50 percent. That’s a stricter threshold than both Cboe’s and CME’s.
The start of futures trading is an important milestone for bitcoin’s shift from the fringes of finance toward the mainstream, but it could be some time before the cryptocurrency becomes a key part of investor portfolios -- if it ever does.
“You never say never,” David Riley, who helps oversee $57 billion as head of credit strategy at BlueBay Asset Management LLP in London, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “But I do think we’re quite some way from making cryptocurrencies even a relatively small part of some of the funds we manage at the moment.”

Title: Making Sense of Bitcoin and Its Wild Price Ride: QuickTake Q&A - Bloomberg

The initial price of bitcoin, set in 2010, was less than 1 cent. Now it’s 
 $17,000. Once seen as the province of nerds, libertarians and drug dealers, bitcoin these days draws millions of dollars from hedge funds. In its latest step toward widespread acceptance, futures trading in bitcoin 
 on two of the largest U.S. exchanges. The recent price surge may be a bubble. Or it could be a belated recognition by the broader financial community that so-called cryptocurrencies -- digital forms of money -- are going mainstream. It 
to nail down what a bitcoin is, and why its price has been going through the roof.
It’s a form of money that’s remarkable for what it’s not: It’s not currency you can hold in your hand. It’s not recognized by most Main Street stores. It’s not issued or backed by a national government. At their core, bitcoin and its imitators are sets of 
 for generating digital tokens and for tracking transactions in a way that makes it hard to counterfeit or re-use tokens. A bitcoin has value only to the extent that its users agree that it does.
The original software was laid out in a 
 in 2008 by a person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identify remains unknown, despite several efforts to assign or claim 
. Online fantasy games had long used virtual currencies. The key idea behind bitcoin was the 
 -- a publicly visible, largely anonymous online ledger that records bitcoin transactions.
Think about what happens if you make an online transfer using a bank. It verifies that you have the funds, subtracts that amount from one spot in a giant database it maintains of accounts and balances, and credits it in another. You can see the result if you log on to your account but the transaction is under the bank’s control. You’re trusting the bank to remove the right amount of money, and the bank is also making sure you can’t spend that money again. The blockchain is a database that performs those tracking functions -- but without the bank or any other central authority.
It’s done by consensus on a decentralized network. Bitcoin transactions can be made through sites offering electronic 
 that upload the data to the network. New transactions are bundled together into a batch and broadcast to the network for verification by so-called bitcoin miners.
Anybody, so long as you have really fast computers, a 
 and a desire to solve puzzles. The transaction data in each batch is encrypted by a formula that can be unlocked only through trial-and-error guessing on a massive scale. The miners put large-scale computing power to work as they compete to be the first 
. If a miner’s answer is verified by others, the data is added to a linked chain of blocks of data and the miner is rewarded with newly issued bitcoin.
Because every block contains data linking to earlier blocks, an attempt to spend the same bitcoin twice would mean revising many links in the chain. Plus, as miners compete, they 
 each step of the way.
Yes, back when its primary appeal was its relative anonymity. It was, and still is, used by websites peddling everything from arms to drugs to paid hits. One such $1.2 billion marketplace, 
, was shut down by federal agents in 2013. But others soon took its place. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics, 
 that bitcoin "ought to be outlawed” because it’s designed to evade regulation and "doesn’t serve any socially useful function."
Bitcoin’s reputation has improved, partly because there are fewer large-scale thefts like the one in 2014 in which bitcoins 
 from a bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox. (Security has improved, but it’s still an issue.) And many technology and financial firms 
 in blockchain as an idea separate from bitcoin.
Enthusiasts see it as a new way of doing all sorts of business. Costs could be lower without a central middleman doing the work of keeping track of transactions, and charging for it. Banks and stock exchanges have invested heavily in developing blockchain technology, while retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are experimenting with using blockchain for 
. Central banks are even 
 about issuing blockchain-based official currencies. And other forms of blockchain emerged, often using their own cryptocurrencies to facilitate transactions. The most prominent is the 
 blockchain, sometimes described as a platform for so-called smart contracts.
As the number of cryptocurrencies and tokens 
 -- they now reach into the thousands -- bitcoin remains the best-known, time-tested and valuable. That’s led to it being viewed by some as the most predictable venue for people wanting to bet on blockchain’s exponential growth.
New investors, and expectations of many more to follow, has increased the price of a bitcoin more than 16-fold so far this year. The last spurt may have been driven by the news that futures trading was in the offing. Cboe Global Markets Inc. began trading futures contracts tied to bitcoin on Dec. 10, and CME Group Inc. followed suit on the 17th, while Nasdaq 
next year. The ability to trade on bitcoin’s price without owning it -- and 
 that its price will fall -- is seen as expanding bitcoin’s appeal to investors. The fact that bitcoin’s software guarantees that there will be a 
 has added to the fear of missing out for some investors. Coinbase, a bitcoin exchange, was overwhelmed by two to three times its normal traffic on Nov. 29, when bitcoin’s price 
, making its service temporarily unavailable to some users. New crypto-focused hedge funds are opening up weekly, and already surpass 100. Most of them invest at least part of their funds in bitcoin.
Possibly. Some people, most notably JPMorgan Chase & Co. Jamie Dimon, 
 bitcoin a “fraud.” Yet his own bank is considering offering bitcoin futures to clients. Fund manager Mike Novogratz calls cryptocurrencies “the biggest bubble of our lifetimes,” and yet he is starting a $500 million fund to invest in them. Depending on whom you talk to, bitcoin’s value could double again -- or it could go down to zero.
There are a 
, all with different risks. People can buy the coins directly from exchanges like Coinbase. Accredited investors can also invest in vehicles like the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which tracks bitcoin’s price. Now investors can buy or sell bitcoin futures, and soon may be able to buy bitcoin exchange-traded funds, once regulators feel comfortable with the idea. But be warned: Even plenty of people who believe in bitcoin’s future think some wild rides lie ahead. As if in proof, the Nov. 29 surge to over $11,000 was followed by a 20 percent drop.

Title: Strike Over Teva Firings Shuts Israel Bourse, Banks, Airport - Bloomberg

Striking workers idled Israel’s international airport, government offices, banks and stock market for half a day, pressing to scale back 
’s plan to fire 25 percent of its employees.
Teva workers protesting near facilities around the country tied up morning rush-hour traffic on Sunday and burned tires outside a Jerusalem factory where a group of employees barricaded themselves inside. A solidarity walkout called by the Histadrut labor federation lasted until noon, in response to Teva management’s announcement on Thursday that it would cut 1,700 jobs and shut down two plants in the country. The firings are part of a bigger plan to slash 14,000 jobs worldwide as Petah Tikva, Israel-based Teva seeks to whittle a debt pile more than twice its market capitalization.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told members of his cabinet he would use several “tools at our disposal” to prevent the closure of a Teva manufacturing plant in Jerusalem and try to “limit damage” for the company’s employees, according to a text message from his office.
Teva has been struggling since it paid almost $41 billion last year to acquire Allergan Plc’s generics unit, a deal that failed to yield the anticipated sales boost. Compounding the problem is the loss of its monopoly on 
, the multiple sclerosis injection that at one point generated half of Teva’s profits.
Hundreds of Teva employees blocked central roads in Jerusalem and chanted slogans as they marched to Netanyahu’s office as cabinet members arrived for their weekly meeting, police said. The government is considering a grant to Teva that would enable the company to reduce the number of jobs cut in Israel, the Haaretz newspaper said, without saying how it got the information.
“Our factory is bleeding and the situation is bleak,” Teva union leader Itzik Ben-Simon told Israel Radio.
The company was monitoring the protests and seeking to minimize any effect on business operations, spokesman Yonatan Beker said by phone.
“Teva’s supply chain is evaluating its product supplies and production alternatives for all its products at any disrupted facilities and will update its customers directly on the matter," the company said in a statement.
Teva, whose expenses will total $16.1 billion this year, said most of the cost reduction will take place in 2018. It will also record a restructuring charge of at least $700 million.
Teva 
 rose as much as 2.7 percent Sunday after jumping 13 percent Dec. 14 when newly installed Chief Executive Kare Schultz outlined the restructuring plan. Its American depositary receipts in New York rose 10 percent and added 8 percent the following day.
Schultz said his top priority is to bring Teva’s leverage below 4 times Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, by the end of 2020. The ratio was 4.7 last quarter. The proposals include paying down $4 billion of bank loans within a “relatively short” period, he said.
Schultz, who was offered $40 million in cash and stock to take over the company in November, swiftly instituted a management shakeup and announced plans to reorganize Teva’s generic and branded drug businesses into a single, streamlined entity.

Title: For Disney CEO Bob Iger, Fox Deal Is All About Future of TV - Bloomberg

When news broke last month that 
 was in talks to buy a large part of 
, the first question many investors had was, why are the Murdochs selling? Then came the second: Why is Disney buying?
The $50 billion deal, which could be announced this week, would mark a significant turning point in the empire-building career of Fox’s founder and executive chairman, 86-year-old 
. It would also be a defining moment for Disney and its Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger.
Iger has built a reputation over the past 12 years for making bold bets, including the $7.4 billion he paid for Pixar animation just months after he became CEO. But this would be much bigger, giving the home of Mickey Mouse and Princess Elsa the 20th Century Fox film studio, the FX network, 39 percent of Britain’s Sky Plc TV service and other assets. It’s just the kind of consolidation media investors have said was long overdue, particularly in film.
“There’s a lot of synergies in doing this, particularly in global distribution,” said Mario Gabelli, whose Gamco Investors Inc. holds more than $350 million of Fox shares. “If I’m Disney I love the distribution globally, India, satellites in Italy, Germany, England. This is good stuff.”
Disney and Fox may announce a deal Thursday, CNBC reported, without saying where it got the information. The company that will remain after Disney purchases some of Fox’s assets is said to be worth at least $10 per Fox share, CNBC said.
Fox declined to comment on the report when reached by Bloomberg.
Disney could shave as much as $500 million annually in costs by combining businesses, according to Alan Gould, an analyst with Rosenblatt Securities Inc. Half of that would come from the studio side, where Disney could close and sell the Fox lot in Los Angeles, he said in a Dec. 4 note.
The timing is opportune, Gould said, because other potential bidders for Fox, including Verizon Communications Inc., may be hesitant to do a big deal given AT&T Inc.’s current fight with the Justice Department over its proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. Comcast Corp. said Monday that it considered a Fox deal, but never made an offer.
Acquiring the Fox assets fits two of Iger’s big-picture initiatives. One is to bulk up on content, particularly franchises beloved by filmgoers all over the world. Acquisitions he’s made in the past, such as Lucasfilm and Marvel Entertainment, have allowed Disney to dominate the box office for the past two years.
The Fox studio would give Disney more such franchises, including “Avatar,” “Planet of the Apes” and the X-Men comic book characters. At Disney, Iger scaled back film releases, focusing on a handful of key brands. His strategy with the Fox assets could be very similar, using the 20th Century Fox label for some of the more edgy movies, for example.
“They have the capital and scale and distribution power that Fox is lacking,” said Hal Vogel, an analyst and author of “Entertainment Industry Economics: A Guide for Financial Analysis.” “Fox can continue in the business for quite a long time. but Disney has much bigger scale potential. They have the capital they can pour into it. They can exploit it more effectively, through merchandising and theme parks.”
That also explains why Murdoch is open to parting with a portion of his media empire. The billionaire has been frustrated with the market undervaluing his assets, and is willing to reshape his empire if he can get what he thinks the holdings are worth, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Iger’s other major strategic initiative is to cut out the middle man and establish a relationship directly with consumers. Here the Fox assets fit as well, such as doubling Disney’s stake in the Hulu streaming service to 60 percent and acquiring a big chunk of Sky, which offers pay TV service to 22.5 million customers in five countries in Europe.
And as Iger prepares to launch two online subscription TV services in the U.S., one for ESPN next year and one for Disney-branded movies and shows in 2019, Fox assets could give him more to fill those pipes and more opportunity to offset the loss of subscribers to Disney’s traditional TV channels, according to Macquarie Capital analyst Tim Nollen.
“For Disney, scale and distribution together matter more now, and this would give it both in droves,” Nollen said in a Dec. 6 note.
Disney shares rose less than 1 percent to $107.21 at 10:34 a.m. in New York, while Fox rose 1 percent to $34. Sky 
 0.8 percent to 1,008 pence in London.
There’s always a chance that Disney takes on too much by trying to merge distinctly different companies. Fox, with hits such as “Deadpool” and “The Simpsons,” has always had a more irreverent streak than Disney, which works hard to protect its family-friendly image.
Seeing through a complicated merger may be just what’s needed to convince Iger to stay beyond his scheduled July 2019 retirement. That would be fine with many investors.
“We would be very happy with Bob Iger at the helm of Disney for an extended period of time,” said Richard “Trip” Miller, a managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners in Memphis. “His ability to grow long-term shareholder value via operating discipline and strategic acquisitions allows us to sleep well at night.”

Title: Suicide Bombers Attack Church in Pakistan, Killing 9 - Bloomberg

Quetta, Pakistan (AP) -- Two suicide bombers struck a church in Pakistan on Sunday, killing nine people and wounding more than 50 others, authorities said, in the first attack on a church claimed by the country's Islamic State group affiliate.
Hundreds of worshippers were attending services ahead of Christmas when the bombers appeared in the city of Quetta and clashed with security forces. One assailant was killed at the church entrance. The other made it inside, said Sarfaraz Bugti, home minister for the southwestern Baluchistan province.
Baluchistan Police Chief Moazzam Ansari praised the response of security forces guarding the church, saying the attacker who made it inside was wounded and unable to reach the main building.
"Otherwise the loss of lives could have been much higher," he told reporters.
Quetta Police Chief Abdur Razzaq Cheema said a search was underway for two suspected accomplices who escaped.
Local television showed ambulances and security patrols racing to the scene as women and children were being led out of the church's main gate.
The Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for the attack on their Aamaq news agency, saying two "plungers" from their group had stormed the church, without providing further details.
It was the first time the Islamic State group has claimed an attack on a church in Pakistan, though Muslim extremists have claimed church attacks in the past. The deadliest example was in September 2013, when twin suicide bomb blasts killed 85 people in a Peshawar church. In March 2015, two suicide bombers attacked two churches in the eastern city of Lahore, killing 15 people.
Fifty-seven people were wounded in the latest attack, including seven who were listed in critical condition, according to Wasim Baig, a spokesman for Quetta's main hospital.
A young girl in a white dress sobbed as she recounted the attack to Geo television, saying many people around her were wounded.
Aqil Anjum, who was shot in his right arm, told The Associated Press he heard a blast in the middle of the service, followed by heavy gunfire.
"It was chaos. Bullets were hitting people inside the closed hall," he said.
Dozens of Christians gathered outside a nearby hospital to protest the lack of security. Pakistan's president and other senior officials condemned the attack.

Title: Goldman Wants a 100% Margin on Some Bitcoin Futures Trades - Bloomberg

 demanded some clients set aside funds equal to the full value of their bitcoin futures trade as a condition for clearing the transaction, according to people familiar with the investments.
The demands deterred some customers from seeking to clear trades through the bank and led them to take their business elsewhere, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the matter. The guidelines are inclusive of other margin requirements such as Options Clearing Corp.’s 44 percent, required to clear contracts traded on the Cboe Global Markets Inc., and the 47 percent to be demanded by CME Group Inc. when it begins trading bitcoin futures next week.
“Margin decisions are based on multiple factors and vary on a case-by-case basis,” Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said Thursday in a statement. 
The bank is one of a handful that have cleared the trades since the Cboe began offering futures contracts earlier this week. Bitcoin’s volatility spurred many large banks to hold off on clearing trades. Options Clearing and CME raised their margin requirements amid wild 
 in the market.
It’s not uncommon for a brokerage to impose steeper requirements than the exchange. Interactive Brokers Group Inc., which has said it handled 53 percent of the first day’s trading in Cboe’s bitcoin futures, will require a margin of 50 percent for long investments, and about 240 percent for short selling, based on current rates, according to Interactive spokeswoman Kalen Holliday.
A 
 is how much investors must set aside so that other parties in the trade know any losses can be covered. The guidelines for bitcoin futures are several times that of commodities such as gold and oil.

Title: Thales Outflanks Atos With Surprise $5.6 Billion Bid for Gemalto - Bloomberg

French aerospace specialist Thales SA knocked out Atos SE’s unsolicited attempt to buy Dutch cybersecurity provider 
, outbidding the rival with a cash offer valued at 4.76 billion euros ($5.6 billion) that won backing from the target company.
The offer for 51 euros a share comes less than a week after the 46-euro bid by Atos, which Gemalto rejected as “significantly” undervaluing the company. By contrast, Thales received unanimous support for its overture from Gemalto’s board, gaining the upper hand with a foray that marks the biggest bet yet for Chief Executive Officer Patrice Caine since he took over three years ago. Atos responded by saying it will no longer pursue Gemalto.
The surprise appearance of Thales outmaneuvered Atos CEO Thierry Breton, a former French Finance Minister, whose earlier offer got a lukewarm response. Both suitors were drawn by Gemalto’s security products that help protect companies and governments against data hacks and identity theft in an increasingly connected world. Thales is the bigger of the two interested companies and has a powerful shareholder in the French state, which owns about 25 percent and is also the single largest investor at Amsterdam-based Gemalto.
Gemalto CEO Philippe Vallee, who will keep his post under the new owner, said his company was swayed by Thales’s financially more attractive offer, “but also the acceleration in our strategy and the overall rationale of the transaction that convinced the board.”
The Gemalto transaction would be Europe’s 
 this year, highlighting how companies are clamoring for online security expertise as data breaches around the world become more prevalent. For Thales, the offer marks a major strategic expansion away from its core business, which covers areas such as avionics equipment and air-traffic management, where Thales is the global leader.
Thales said it doesn’t expect to cut Gemalto’s workforce and has secured a 4 billion-euro credit facility to fund the transaction. Thales’s dividend policy will remain unchanged, it said. The deal needs backing from investors holding at least 67 percent of Gemalto, the companies said. Thales expects to complete the acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, in the second half of next year.
Gemalto will operate under its own brand as one of the seven global business units at Thales. The new unit would have about 3.5 billion euros in revenue, representing about 20 percent of Thales’s sales. The deal should result in savings through synergies of as much as 150 million euros by 2021, Thales said.
For years, Gemalto has sought to move away from its declining legacy business of SIM cards for phones and bank cards to focus instead on software. While that paid off for a while, challenges intensified over the past 18 months as it became clear that the company had overestimated the pace at which customers would shift to new technologies.

Title: You Can Trade Bitcoin Futures. But Should You? - Bloomberg

Trading in bitcoin futures 
 on Cboe Global Markets Inc. Its rival, CME Group Inc., will soon follow suit. It’s a milestone in the acceptance of the digital currency by the world of mainstream investing, spurred in part by bitcoin’s meteoric rise this year. 
 still abound, however, including executives at some of the world’s largest banks. For the doubters, at least there’s this silver lining: Futures trading may add an opportunity to 
 what they see as a bubble.
On a network of unregulated exchanges, which have their own prices for the digital currency -- and a long history of problems that range from service crashes to hacks and thefts. Buying and holding bitcoin is essentially a bet that its value will rise further. Not everybody who wants to get involved in this market thinks so.
Futures contracts -- which derive their value from some underlying thing like corn, wheat, or in this case, a digital currency -- oblige a buyer to pay for something at an agreed-upon price at a certain date in the future. They can be used to make a bet on which way the market for a product is going to move. They can also be used to short a market, or bet that prices will fall.
Three of the largest U.S. exchange companies, all overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are debuting bitcoin futures contracts. Cboe is getting its contract to market first. CME will begin offering a competing product on Dec. 18. Nasdaq Inc. is 
 to introduce bitcoin futures next year. The other major U.S. exchange player, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., has not yet announced any plans to do so. “We may be stupid for not being first on that,” Jeff Sprecher, CEO of ICE, said 
 this month.
Exchanges want to offer what investors want to trade, and a lot more people want to trade in the bitcoin market than even a year ago. Coinbase, a large bitcoin exchange, was overwhelmed by 
 as bitcoin soared toward $10,000 in late November. CME, which 
 hadn’t made a decision on how to address cryptocurrencies, ultimately decided the allure was too much to resist. For traders, bitcoin offers an entirely new landscape to navigate. One hallmark of bitcoin trading is unpredictable price swings, a stark contrast to the eerie calm that’s settled over other financial markets, including U.S. equities.
Not everyone thinks derivatives based on bitcoin are ready for prime time. One worry is the volatility that so far has been a key feature of the digital currency market. Just three days before Cboe’s product was slated to be introduced, bitcoin had one of its wildest sessions ever: On Coinbase’s GDAX exchange, prices zoomed up to almost $20,000 from $16,000 in only about 90 minutes, before crashing back down.
Some big traders think futures may be premature. The Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- 
 the contracts were rushed without enough consideration of the risks. In an open letter to the exchanges, the group questioned whether they would be able to adequately police market manipulation in bitcoin. The group said the exchanges should have sought more industry feedback on 
, trading limits and stress tests for the system before beginning trading. Cboe and CME are requiring traders to set aside an unusually large pile of cash to serve as collateral to back purchases.
This simple question draws a surprising amount of debate in the investing world. While bitcoin advocates call it a currency, the CFTC views it as a commodity. Skeptics view it as a commodity without any intrinsic value, with demand driven by novelty and the scarcity imposed by bitcoin’s software protocols, which will cap its production. Some analysts think it will trade more like a volatile stock, while others expect it to develop into a new asset class entirely. These arguments are being debated among 
 and hobbyists alike.
Those who believe bitcoin is overheated have a chance to short the market with the introduction of bitcoin futures. Some hedge funds have been 
 to bet against the cryptocurrency.

Title: Seven Tourists Per Inhabitant Is Testing Icelanders' Tolerance - Bloomberg

If two is company and three is a crowd, then seven must be a horde.
Iceland has become such a popular tourist destination that foreign visitors are estimated to outnumber the local population by seven to one this year. The government is now considering whether the scarcely populated island in the North Atlantic can -- and should -- accommodate even more.
“This sector is maturing and becoming a real industry in Iceland, and with that of course come challenges that we need to be ready to tackle,” Thordis Kolbrun R. Gylfadottir, Iceland’s tourism minister, said in an interview in Reykjavik.
As many as 2.3 million people are 
 to have visited Iceland by the end of this year, up from nearly 1.8 million last year (the number of overnight stays totaled 7.8 million in 2016). Tourism is now Iceland’s biggest export and its second-biggest industry after wholesale and retail trade. In 2016 it accounted for 8.4 percent of gross domestic product.
There’s now talk among the roughly 347,000 Icelanders of how to avoid repeating the same mistakes of the herring bonanza of the 1960s and 1970s, when 
 decimated stocks and the local fishing industry.
Tourism is now a systemically important industry, prompting concerns from the central bank about the sustainability of such exponential growth rates. A 
 would be a “shock to the economy as a whole,” Sedlabanki said in its October Financial Stability report. The central bank also warned that tourism is putting pressure on the 
, citing a “surge in short-term private rentals.”
The recently installed left-right coalition government to which Gylfadottir belongs is considering a series of measures designed to, if not limit arrivals, at least improve the quality of the experience.
“We need to map this out to see what we can do to make the tolerance higher. Sometimes it is about strengthening infrastructure, sometimes it can be about steering access to particular areas,” the minister said. “The decisions we make will affect how this sector will evolve.”
The previous administration, in which Gylfadottir held the same office, had decided to hike tourism VAT rates, currently at the mid level of 11 percent. But that proposal was put aside after strong objections from the industry. Iceland is already a fiendishly expensive destination, and “tourism companies are dealing with higher wages and a stronger krona,” she said.
Another idea being floated involves applying a special fee (the previous government called it a ‘nature pass’), whose proceeds would be used to finance the preservation of the island’s unique natural resources. “This is yet to be discussed and worked out,” the minister said. “We will probably never compete with the lowest priced destinations, but people need to experience that they are getting their money’s worth.”
The government is also open to greater foreign investment, now that capital controls have all but been removed. Large chunks of the local KEAHotels chain have already been snatched up by foreign funds.

Title: ThaiBev Set for $4.8 Billion Stake in Vietnam's Biggest Brewer - Bloomberg

 is poised to take a majority stake in 
 valued at $4.8 billion, after an auction for Vietnam’s larger brewer attracted no other major bidders.
Vietnam Beverage, ThaiBev’s domestic unit, registered to bid for 343.662 million or a 53.59 percent stake in Sabeco, as Vietnam’s largest brewer is known, Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade said Sunday. An undisclosed individual domestic investor registered to bid for 20,000 shares. In all, the ministry garnered bids for about 343.682 million shares in Sabeco.
Investors bidding on less than 25 percent of the company’s shares had until Sunday to register for an auction of shares in Sabeco that will be held on Dec. 18. Billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi controlled 
’s unit was the only company that registered by Dec. 11, the last date for investors seeking more than a 25 percent stake.
While half-a-dozen global companies including 
 and 
 had shown an interest earlier, they may have been put off by Sabeco’s valuation, as the stock has surged 56 percent this year. The lackluster interest could weigh on the government’s program to attract investors to stakes in other state-owned companies as Vietnam pushes ahead with economic reforms to boost growth, said Le Net, head of LNT & Partners Law Firm in Ho Chi Minh City.
“It’s not just that the price is very high, but also the short timing of the process made it impossible for investors to do due diligence to justify the deal with their boards,” he said.
ThaiBev 
 Wednesday that it has confidence in the “growth potential of the Vietnam market and has genuine interest in exploring investment opportunities in the country.”
An expanding middle class and youthful population helped drive a 300 percent surge in beer demand since 2002, according to Euromonitor International, which estimates the market was worth 147.2 trillion dong ($6.5 billion) in 2016.
“ThaiBev strongly believes in the long-term growth prospects of the Vietnamese beer market,” said Tyler Cheung, director of institutional clients at ACB Securities JSC. “The opportunity to become a meaningful player in a market expected to reach just under 5 billion litres of consumption by 2020 was just too attractive to pass up, even when considering the relatively high price of the offering.”
ThaiBev’s unit is registered as a local company, making it eligible to take a controlling stake as foreign ownership limits do not apply to it, the ministry said. The 54 percent stake in Sabeco would be worth about $4.8 billion based on the government’s initial price guidance of 320,000 dong ($14.09) a share.

Title: CFTC Warns of Bitcoin-Futures Dangers, After Allowing Them - Bloomberg

Bitcoin is going mainstream via the futures market, and the U.S. regulator that allowed it to happen has a message: buyer beware.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a statement Friday detailing “the risks of virtual currency trading” and urged investors to educate themselves before buying into an asset class that has surged more than 1,700 percent this year.
The warning underscores that even as Washington makes it easier for bitcoin to move out of the shadows, worries remain that the mom-and-pop investors who’ve helped fuel its rise have little idea what they’re jumping into. Some of the biggest names in finance have called the digital currency everything from a massive bubble to an outright fraud.
Two weeks ago, the 
 enabled a watershed for bitcoin by announcing that CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc. would start offering bitcoin derivatives: a move that has helped fuel an 80 percent jump in the spot market.
Although the futures products didn’t technically require regulatory approval, the CFTC could have stymied the exchanges’ plans if it wasn’t satisfied with them. The agency let them go forward, and trading on the CME is set to start Sunday after a Cboe contract listed earlier this week. The exchanges got the green light after going through a process called self-certification -- a pledge to the CFTC that the contracts don’t run afoul of the law. 
“Like all futures products, speculating in these markets should be considered a high-risk transaction,” the CFTC 
. “Customers should inform themselves as to how the index or auction prices used to settle the contract are determined.”
In addition to warning about the futures market, the CFTC on Friday also listed dangers on the spot market which include: manipulation, hacking of customer wallets, lack of regulation and volatility.

Title: Bitcoin's First 24 Hours on Wall Street Feed Euphoria and Doubts - Bloomberg

Bitcoin’s triumphant debut on Wall Street hasn’t ended the financial industry’s skepticism.
The new breed of futures contracts that launched on 
’s exchange late Sunday quickly became a 24-hour microcosm of bitcoin’s own wild ride this year, marked by technical glitches and surging valuations. The first day left true believers cheering, yet kept many mainstream financial professionals peering uneasily from the sidelines.
While the derivatives were a success by some key measures -- they didn’t blow up -- their 24 percent rise in price in the first session also bolstered longstanding misgivings about speculation. The contracts offer an easier way for investors to 
 the cryptocurrency, but instead buyers bid them up as much as 13 percent higher than the underlying asset -- setting off two temporary trading halts along the way. That gave new oomph to the rally and debate.
“The premium is a bullish indicator,” said Michael Kazley, co-founder of Crescent Crypto Asset Management, acknowledging he assumed the contracts would more closely track the cryptocurrency. “It can be explained by demand for exposure to the price of bitcoin from investors who otherwise cannot or do not want to own actual bitcoins."
Others saw the gap as a sign that it may not be possible to marry the virtual currency with the traditional financial industry. When contracts expire, buyers get cash -- not bitcoin itself -- weakening links to the underlying asset. The worry is that derivatives will act too independently.
“The futures market opening was a mild disaster in many respects,” said Aaron Brown, a former managing director at AQR Capital Management who invests in the cryptocurrency and writes for Bloomberg Prophets. “It was supposed to mimic the price of the physical, it wasn’t supposed to hit limit triggers twice.”
Wall Street trading desks have been yearning for more volatility in many asset classes this year, so they can make more money handling client transactions. Bitcoin may be too volatile. An industry group made up of big banks, brokers and traders said last week it was concerned that the cryptocurrency’s volatility could lead investors to default on contracts if prices swing hard.
Some of the world’s largest banks maintained their cautious stance on Monday. Firms including 
, 
 and 
 are continuing to evaluate whether they’ll offer clearing of the futures, according to people with knowledge of their deliberations.
Cboe launched bitcoin futures at 6 p.m. New York time on Sunday. During the first hour, traffic on its website was so heavy that it caused delays and temporary outages, without interfering with trading systems. CME Group Inc., the world’s biggest exchange owner, is set to launch similar products on Dec. 18.
The futures trading legitimizes bitcoin to some degree, said Kevin Grimes, president of Westborough, Massachusetts-based Grimes & Co. It allows more institutional money to flow in, while giving firms a way to hedge positions.
The price gap shows people are seeking exposure to bitcoin without buying it directly, he said. “So in the short run that could change the supply and demand a little bit,” he said. “But in the grand scheme of things it probably is a good thing for bitcoin structurally, because it will allow for larger amounts of institutional money to more comfortably buy positions.”
The new futures will probably help create a more regulated and steady underlying market, paving the way for more additional products, hedge fund lawyer Stephen Bielecki of Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolff & Cohen wrote in a note Monday. “Many anticipate” that the Securities and Exchange Commission will eventually approve an exchange-traded fund tied to bitcoin, he said.
For its part, bitcoin rose 9.6 percent to $17,148 on Monday -- a roughly 17-fold advance this year.
“Our view on bitcoin is unchanged,” said Tim Ng, chief investment officer of Clearbrook Global Advisors. “The valuation has no basis, as there are no assets to back it, nor does it have the faith and full credit of a recognized entity such as a central bank. This has been a one-way street with people putting in money, and no one coming out. ”

Title: Bitcoin Breaches $13,000 as Futures Move Closer to Reality - Bloomberg

Bitcoin topped $13,000 for the first time, pushing this week’s gains to more than 30 percent amid speculation that the use of futures will help make digital currencies a legitimate asset class for mainstream investors.
The largest cryptocurrency by market value has soared from less than $1,000 at the start of the year as optimism climbs for the distributed ledger technology known as blockchain that is at the heart of bitcoin. The price surge has been accompanied by a growing chorus of warnings that the speculative frenzy is an asset bubble poised to burst.
Cboe Global Markets Inc. has said it will start trading bitcoin futures on Dec. 10, while CME Group Inc.’s contracts are set to debut on Dec. 18. Nasdaq Inc. is planning to offer futures in 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter. Cantor Fitzgerald LP’s Cantor Exchange is creating a bitcoin derivative, and startup LedgerX already offers options.

Title: All You Need to Know About Bitcoin’s Rise, From $0.01 to $15,000 - Bloomberg

The initial price of bitcoin, set in 2010, was less than 1 cent. Now it’s 
 $16,000. Once seen as the province of nerds, libertarians and drug dealers, bitcoin today is drawing millions of dollars from hedge funds. The recent price surge may be a bubble. Or it could be a belated recognition by the broader financial community that so-called cryptocurrencies -- digital forms of money -- are going mainstream. It 
to nail down what a bitcoin is, and why its price has been going through the roof.
It’s a form of money that’s remarkable for what it’s not: It’s not currency you can hold in your hand. It’s not recognized by most Main Street stores. It’s not issued or backed by a national government. At their core, bitcoin and its imitators are sets of 
 for generating digital tokens and for tracking transactions in a way that makes it hard to counterfeit or re-use tokens. A bitcoin has value only to the extent that its users agree that it does.
The original software was laid out in a 
 in 2008 by a person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identify remains unknown, despite several efforts to assign or claim 
. Online fantasy games had long used virtual currencies. The key idea behind bitcoin was the 
 -- a publicly visible, largely anonymous online ledger that records bitcoin transactions.
Think about what happens if you make an online transfer using a bank. It verifies that you have the funds, subtracts that amount from one spot in a giant database it maintains of accounts and balances, and credits it in another. You can see the result if you log on to your account but the transaction is under the bank’s control. You’re trusting the bank to remove the right amount of money, and the bank is also making sure you can’t spend that money again. The blockchain is a database that performs those tracking functions -- but without the bank or any other central authority.
It’s done by consensus on a decentralized network. Bitcoin transactions can be made through sites offering electronic 
 that upload the data to the network. New transactions are bundled together into a batch and broadcast to the network for verification by so-called bitcoin miners.
Anybody, so long as you have really fast computers, a 
 and a desire to solve puzzles. The transaction data in each batch is encrypted by a formula that can be unlocked only through trial-and-error guessing on a massive scale. The miners put large-scale computing power to work as they compete to be the first 
. If a miner’s answer is verified by others, the data is added to a linked chain of blocks of data and the miner is rewarded with newly issued bitcoin.
Because every block contains data linking to earlier blocks, an attempt to spend the same bitcoin twice would mean revising many links in the chain. Plus, as miners compete, they 
 each step of the way.
Yes, back when its primary appeal was its relative anonymity. It was, and still is, used by websites peddling everything from arms to drugs to paid hits. One such $1.2 billion marketplace, 
, was shut down by federal agents in 2013. But others soon took its place. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics, 
 that bitcoin "ought to be outlawed” because it’s designed to evade regulation and "doesn’t serve any socially useful function."
Bitcoin’s reputation has improved, partly because there are fewer large-scale thefts like the one in 2014 in which bitcoins 
 from a bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox. (Security has improved, but it’s still an issue.) And many technology and financial firms 
 in blockchain as an idea separate from bitcoin.
Enthusiasts see it as a new way of doing all sorts of business. Costs could be lower without a central middleman doing the work of keeping track of transactions, and charging for it. Banks and stock exchanges have invested heavily in developing blockchain technology, while retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are experimenting with using blockchain for 
. Central banks are even 
 about issuing blockchain-based official currencies. And other forms of blockchain emerged, often using their own cryptocurrencies to facilitate transactions. The most prominent is the 
 blockchain, sometimes described as a platform for so-called smart contracts.
As the number of cryptocurrencies and tokens 
 -- they now reach into the thousands -- bitcoin remains the best-known, time-tested and valuable. That’s led to it being viewed by some as the most predictable venue for people wanting to bet on blockchain’s exponential growth.
New investors, and expectations of many more to follow, has increased the price of a bitcoin about 11-fold so far this year. CME Group and other exchanges 
 bitcoin futures contracts, potentially expanding bitcoin’s appeal. The fact that bitcoin’s software guarantees that there will be a 
 has added to the fear of missing out for some investors. Coinbase, a bitcoin exchange, was overwhelmed by two to three times its normal traffic on Nov. 29, when bitcoin’s price

Possibly. Some people, most notably JPMorgan Chase & Co. Jamie Dimon, 
 bitcoin a “fraud.” Yet his own bank is considering offering bitcoin futures to clients. Fund manager Mike Novogratz calls cryptocurrencies “the biggest bubble of our lifetimes,” and yet he is starting a $500 million fund to invest in them. Depending on whom you talk to, bitcoin’s value could double again -- or it could go down to zero.
There are a

Accredited investors can also invest in vehicles like the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which tracks bitcoin’s price. Soon investors will be able to invest through their regular brokers in bitcoin futures, and possibly in bitcoin exchange-traded funds, once regulators feel comfortable with the idea. But be warned: Even plenty of people who believe in bitcoin’s future think some wild rides lie ahead. As if in proof, the Nov. 29 surge to over $11,000 was followed by a 20 percent drop.

Title: Bitcoin Futures Criticized by Brokers for Overlooking Risks - Bloomberg

Some of the world’s biggest derivatives brokerages criticized 
 by U.S. exchanges to offer bitcoin futures and options, saying the contracts have been rushed to market without proper consideration of the risks.
The brokerages, who laid out their concerns in an open letter via the 
 on Wednesday, said exchanges failed to get enough feedback from market participants on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests and clearing. Highlighting bitcoin’s elevated volatility and reliance on unregulated venues for pricing, the brokerages also questioned whether exchanges had the tools to prevent market manipulation.
Misgivings among the FIA’s members, who include Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., underscore the controversy surrounding bitcoin as it moves from the fringes of finance toward the mainstream. 
 and 
 both used an expedited self-certification process to approve the listing of bitcoin futures, hoping to tap investor demand after the cryptocurrency’s more than 1,400 percent rally this year.
“A more thorough and considered process would have allowed for a robust public discussion among clearing member firms, exchanges and clearinghouses,” the FIA said in its letter, which was addressed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and signed by FIA Chief Executive Officer Walt Lukken.
While the letter is unlikely to change the exchanges’ plans, it raises questions about how many brokerages will participate once bitcoin derivatives start trading later this month. Some dealers, particularly the so-called clearing members required to stand behind client trades, are concerned about their exposure if the cryptocurrency’s extreme volatility leads to trader defaults. There should have been a public discussion about whether a separate guarantee fund -- used to limit the impact of defaults -- was warranted for the new contracts, the FIA said.
The exchanges were allowed to offer bitcoin products after pledging to regulators that they comply with the law. Cboe will start trading futures on Dec. 10, while CME’s contracts are set to debut on Dec. 18. The products will be subject to CFTC oversight.
Bitcoin, which topped $15,000 for the first time on Thursday, has received mixed reviews on Wall Street. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called the cryptocurrency “a fraud,” while Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, said 
 that it’s too early for his bank to need a bitcoin strategy. Franklin Templeton’s Mark Mobius called it a bubble, but added that “bubbles can last a long time.” Some hedge funds are waiting for futures to bet against it, more than half a dozen people trading the assets 
 Bloomberg News.
The FIA said its members have reservations about the reliability of prices underlying the bitcoin contracts. Some of the venues on which the cryptocurrency trades have suffered hacks and breakdowns. Bitcoin plunged nearly 20 percent in less than 90 minutes on Nov. 29 after reports of intermittent outages at cryptocurrency exchanges struggling to keep up with user interest.
Bitcoin is “a commodity unlike any the commission has dealt with in the past,” CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo said in a Dec. 1 statement. “We expect that the futures exchanges, through information sharing agreements, will be monitoring the trading activity on the relevant cash platform.”
CFTC spokeswoman Erica Elliott Richardson said that Giancarlo has been “clear that market participants should take note that the relatively nascent underlying cash markets and exchanges for bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets over which the CFTC has limited statutory authority, and that investors should be aware of the potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts.”
Some brokerages are skeptical.
“We remain apprehensive with the lack of transparency and regulation of the underlying reference products on which these futures contracts are based and whether exchanges have the proper oversight to ensure the reference products are not susceptible to manipulation, fraud, and operational risk,” the FIA said in its letter.

Title: BMW Aims for a 50% Increase in Electric Vehicle Sales Next Year - Bloomberg

 is targeting another ambitious hike in plug-in hybrid and battery car sales next year to defend its position in the electric-car shift as competitors like 
 ready their own battery 
.
The planned increase to about 150,000 cars sold would represent a 50 percent rise from this year, and a jump of about two-thirds from last year’s deliveries of green cars. BMW, an early mover in the electric-car shift with 2013’s i3, is facing increasing competition from rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.
“We’ll definitely boost sales by a mid-double digit amount,’’ Klaus Froehlich, who heads development for BMW, told reporters in Munich. “This is to stay ahead of the competition that’s starting to do its own rollout.‘’
Faced with tightening emissions regulation, BMW and other carmakers are spending record amounts developing a more attractive suite of electric cars to kick-start 
 consumer sales. The payoff remains uncertain, as high battery prices will 
 compared to equivalent combustion engine vehicles -- at least for a number of years. Demand for the vehicles remains at a fraction of total auto sales, with BMW’s target paling compared to its total 2016 deliveries of 2.4 million vehicles.
To help pay for the shift, BMW will start sales next year of the all-new 
 and 8-Series coupe, priced at around 100,000 euros ($119,000). The expanded top-line segment will go head-to-head with Mercedes-Benz’s luxury variants like the S-Class coupe and Maybach sub-brand. Unlike Mercedes’s parent 
, also the world’s biggest commercial vehicle maker, or 12-brand behemoth Volkswagen, BMW has less opportunity to spread development costs of its suite of at least 12 all-electric cars by 2025. Volkswagen plans to offer 50 battery cars by then.
“Our goal for the luxury segment in the next few years is taking more market share,’’ Chief Executive Officer Harald Krueger said in speech notes, adding that the new suite of luxury cars will be sold under the “Bayerische Motoren Werke’’ signature. “In 2018, we’re significantly enlarging our offering in this lucrative growth segment.’’
BMW is in the midst of a record rollout of 40 all-new and revamped vehicles this year and next, seeking to wrest back global leadership of luxury car sales from Mercedes. Its Stuttgart, Germany-based rival overtook BMW last year for the first time in a decade, after overhauling a stodgy lineup with sportier styling and adding new models.
BMW’s electric push coincides with the biggest transformation for the industry in decades, drawing in a host of new competitors like 
 and Uber Technologies Inc. BMW last month flagged it’ll spend 7 billion euros on research and development this year, as much as 2011 and 2012 taken together. 
Mercedes, meanwhile, said it’s targeting savings of 4 billion euros by 2025, saying returns on electric cars could be roughly 
 of gasoline and diesel vehicles for some years. The concerns about mastering the pressures have pushed the valuations of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen to the bottom four rungs in the DAX Index.
BMW’s struggles with slow sales of the i3 city car, which used a lightweight carbon-fiber body for the first time in a mass-produced vehicle, prompted the carmaker to dial back its electric ambitions and pause from adding more electric-only models to its lineup.
Next year, it’s bringing out an electric Mini, followed by a battery-powered X3 sport utility vehicle in 2020, adding electric powertrains to existing models rather than creating a distinct, separate lineup like Mercedes’s planned 10-auto EQ range. The approach will give BMW the option to tailor output of plug-ins and electric cars to yet-uncertain demand. However, flexible production setups are also usually more expensive and might require some compromises in some models to fit batteries, Warburg Research analyst Marc-Rene Tonn wrote in a report.
In the future, BMW will bundle its electric model versions under its ‘i’ brand, and has reserved naming rights for models iX1 through iX9.
“This can’t be just about showcase cars,’’ said Froehlich. “We have to boost profitability and keep prices on an acceptable level by delving very, very deeply into our cost structure.’’

Title: Bitcoin Heads to Wall Street Whether Regulators Are Ready or Not - Bloomberg

Two U.S. exchanges, including the parent of the venerable Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are racing to embrace bitcoin, dragging federal regulators into a realm skeptics call a fad and fraud.
The development shows how some big financial players are moving to co-opt the volatile cryptocurrency and lure more mainstream investors into the market, even before regulators have agreed on just what bitcoin is.
CME Group Inc.’s 
 will debut Dec. 18. Cboe Global Markets Inc. 
 a start date. Both got the green light Friday after going through a process called self-certification -- a pledge to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the products don’t run afoul of the law. The news pushed bitcoin’s 
.
The moves are a watershed for Wall Street professionals -- including institutional investors and 
 -- who’ve been eager to bet on cryptocurrencies and their wild swings, but worried about doing so on mostly unregulated markets. The new products are subject to CFTC oversight. CME, Cboe and Cantor Fitzgerald LP’s Cantor Exchange -- which is creating another kind of bitcoin derivative, binary options -- promised to help the agency surveil the underlying bitcoin market.
“Bitcoin, a virtual currency, is a commodity unlike any the commission has dealt with in the past,” CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo said in a statement Friday. “We expect that the futures exchanges, through information sharing agreements, will be monitoring the trading activity on the relevant cash platforms.”
Trading in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is largely unregulated, and that’s the point. Bitcoin was introduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a way of avoiding governments and central banks. Now with its meteoric rise and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies, banks, brokers and mainstream investors want in. And they want regulation, something they’ll get plenty of in a market like CME or Cboe’s.
“The launch of the futures will actually make the market healthier,” Cboe President Chris Concannon said in an interview after the news broke Friday. “It will create pricing equilibrium in the market. Clients who are holding bitcoin now have no way to hedge their risk. These products allow them to hedge, and to take opposing views. More importantly, it brings a wave of regulatory oversight.”
U.S. financial regulators have struggled for years to agree on what, exactly, bitcoin is and what risks it might pose. That’s left its enthusiasts and financial professionals unsure which government agencies might try to police the rapidly growing market. In addition to the CFTC, there’s the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department’s FinCEN, which tracks illicit payments.
The CFTC declared in 2015 that it would treat bitcoin as a commodity. “But the IRS says it’s property, the SEC said now some digital currency is a security, and FinCEN says digital currency is a ‘money-like instrument,’” said Adam White, general manager of GDAX, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by Coinbase. His company is trying to work with all of them, he said, while offering his own definition: “It’s a new asset class.”
After Friday’s announcement, exchanges and the CFTC will have to keep tabs on that underlying market, according to Jeff Bandman, who until June advised Chairman Giancarlo on financial technology issues.
“It’s well understood that bad actors can take actions in the spot market for a commodity where the reward or payoff is the derivatives market and vice versa,” Bandman, who now runs Bandman Advisors, said in an interview before Friday’s announcement. “This would represent a new opportunity for mischief.”
There are other ways the new futures could spur more vigorous oversight of the cryptocurrency. The contracts, for example, could make it easier to create an exchange-traded fund tied to bitcoin -- even after a previous attempt was knocked down.
That could enlist the SEC. In March, the agency rejected a bitcoin ETF proposed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss -- the co-creators of the Gemini exchange -- saying necessary surveillance-sharing agreements were too difficult given that “significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated.” Cboe is basing its futures on prices from Gemini.
On Thursday, a top SEC official weighed in. David Shillman, associate director in the agency’s division of trading and markets, said a strong bitcoin futures market could make the regulator more comfortable approving bitcoin ETFs.
Many mainstream investors and their brokers -- lured by bitcoin’s meteoric rise this year -- wouldn’t mind some government oversight to head off potential abuses. But regulating these futures only works so well if the underlying market isn’t safe.
“The problem with the futures contracts is they are regulated derivatives that are based off underlying trading in unregulated markets,” Richard Johnson, a market-structure analyst at Greenwich Associates who specializes in blockchain, said before Friday’s announcement. “That does create a potential problem.”
Ever since digital currencies began emerging, U.S. regulators have faced a big dilemma: The laws that empower watchdogs and delineate their areas of responsibility were written decades ago when money was minted on paper, companies turned mainly to the stock market for capital, and commodities came from farms, mines or wells. Many authorities have held back, studying what to do.
CME Chief Executive Officer Terrence Duffy sped up that process in October when he disclosed his plan for futures. His announcement of an imminent product caught some CFTC officials by surprise, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
The problem among regulators is that they each have roles with bitcoin, but that there’s too little coordination, said Justin Slaughter, a former top aide to a CFTC commissioner who now consults on financial technology and regulation as a partner at Mercury Strategies.
“It’s been very scattershot, it’s been somewhat confused,” he said.

Title: Biggest European Tech Deal Barely Cracks the Global Top Ten - Bloomberg

Just how small is the European technology sector?
This year’s largest European technology deal just saw the light of day, and it’s less than a 20th the size of 2017’s biggest proposed U.S. tech transaction. Atos SE’s unsolicited 4.3-billion-euro ($5.06 billion) 
 for Gemalto NV is also the region’s only entry to the global top 10 for the sector this year, with U.S. deal volume in the past years reaching multiples of Europe as well as attracting higher premiums.
Technology shares, this year’s top-performing group, represent roughly 4 percent of the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, versus 24 percent for the S&P 500. To illustrate this difference, Apple Inc.’s 2 percent stock gain on Monday added $17 billion to its market value.
Including last year’s $32 billion takeover of ARM Holdings Plc by Softbank Group Corp. and Qualcomm Inc.’s talks over NXP Semiconductors NV started in 2016 would make the list look different. Yet, that year increasingly looks like an anomaly. The $111 billion in European tech deal volume has fallen to $35 billion with a 20 percent average premium in 2017, compared with U.S. deals exceeding $200 billion in both years with a 28 percent premium, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Title: Hedge Funds Prepare to Trade Against Bitcoin - Bloomberg

A bitcoin big short is building.
The planned introduction of bitcoin futures contracts at CME Group Inc., Cboe Global Markets Inc. and Nasdaq Inc. will make it much easier to bet on a decline. Hedge funds, which have largely stayed on the sidelines, are waiting for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s futures market to open for a fresh opportunity to bet against the cryptocurrency, according to more than a half dozen people trading the assets.
“The futures reduce the frictions of going short more than they do of going long, so it’s probably net bearish,” said Craig Pirrong, a business professor at the University of Houston. “Having this instrument that makes it easier to short might keep the bitcoin price a little closer to reality.”
Bitcoin has gained millions of percent since it started trading in 2010. An investment of $1 at the beginning would now be valued at more than $1.4 million. A dollar invested in the S&P 500 stock index for the same period would now be worth less than $4 including reinvested dividends. 
Some see the bitcoin market as “one of the greatest shorting opportunities ever,” said Lou Kerner, a partner at Flight VC who invests in the cryptocurrency. “You have a lot of zealotry, and a lot of people, including me, who think it’s the greatest thing to ever happen in the history of mankind. You have a lot of people who think it’s a bubble and a Ponzi scheme. It turns out both of them can’t be right.”
Bitcoin has been especially volatile recently, plunging nearly 20 percent in less than 90 minutes on Nov. 29, to $9,009 after briefly topping $11,000. The price has since recovered, and was trading at more than $11,332.01 at 11:42 a.m. in New York on Monday, a 3.9 percent jump since Friday.
Cboe said Monday it will start trading bitcoin futures on Dec. 10, while CME’s contracts are set to debut on Dec. 18. Nasdaq is planning to offer futures in 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter. Cantor Fitzgerald LP’s Cantor Exchange is creating a bitcoin derivative, and startup LedgerX already offers options.
Ari Paul, co-founder of hedge fund BlockTower Capital and former portfolio manager at the University of Chicago endowment, said people are mistaken if they think the famously volatile cryptocurrency is a clear-cut short.
“While some traders are eager to be able to short bitcoin and will do so when the futures are launched, there is a far greater amount of money eagerly awaiting the futures as a vehicle to go long,” Paul said.
There are limited ways to short bitcoin today, said Michael Moro, chief executive officer of Genesis Global Trading. The cryptocurrency trading platform has lent about $20 million to investors to take bearish positions, which were mostly to hedge existing bets, he said. Companies like GDAX, BitMEX and Bitfinex allow investors to buy assets on margin for short periods.
“With the existing exchanges, no one can get in and short $1 million,” Moro said. “It’s really small potatoes on what you can do today. The CME guys open up a new frontier.”
Bitcoin’s 90 percent surge this year has drawn a range of reactions from Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon famously called the cryptocurrency “a fraud,” while bulls including Thomas Lee at Fundstrat Global Advisors and hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz have predicted more rises.
The ability to short the currency is “an important part of the ecosystem,” said Novogratz, who recently began to raise $500 million to invest in cryptocurrencies. Novogratz, a bitcoin believer in the long term, has said short trades can be risky.
“There is a lot of froth,” he said at a cryptocurrency conference last week in New York. “This is going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes.”
Short sellers essentially borrow a security, betting that the price will fall and they can pocket the difference when they return the holding. The strategy carries risks. Borrowing bitcoin can be difficult, and price swings sudden, said Moro of Genesis.
“The concept is that this is such a volatile market that it’s going to scare a lot of investors away,” said Kerner of Flight VC.
Investors could get stung like those who bet against the internet bubble in the late 1990s, said Aaron Brown, a former managing director at AQR Capital Management who invests in the cryptocurrency.
“People who shorted the internet in 1998 were right, but they went broke before they could collect any winnings,” Brown said. “One of the problems with it, if you believe it’s a bubble or a Ponzi scheme or whatever, it can go on for a long time.”

Title: As Traders Await Bitcoin Futures, Margin Requirements Are High - Bloomberg

Among the complications in trading bitcoin future contracts that launch this Sunday: People speculating on the cryptocurrency will need to put more cash on the table. 
Options Clearing Corp. has set the initial margin requirements at 44 percent of the daily settlement price. Cboe Global Market Inc., which announced that amount on Monday, hasn’t updated it through bitcoin’s wild price swings in the days since. It was raised to that level from 33 percent “in view of bitcoin price volatility,” the exchange operator said at the time.
The cryptocurrency has swung at least 15 percent each of the last three days, and has surged by almost $5,000 this week. It was at $14,990 at 1:15 p.m. in New York on Friday.
A margin requirement is how much investors have to set aside as collateral, so that other parties in the trade know any losses can be covered. The requirement for bitcoin futures is several times that of commodities such as gold and oil.
“One of the reasons why the futures margin requirements are so high is because of the limited size of the overall bitcoin market,” Kevin Kelly, managing partner of Benchmark Investments, which analyzes futures markets to develop indexes. “There’s a lack of depth and breadth.”
The requirement for minimum maintenance margin was also increased to 40 percent from 30 percent, according to the letter.
The Futures Industry Association said in a letter to regulators this week that the trade group of banks and brokers doesn’t believe cryptocurrency trading risks have been properly assessed. The concerns included that exchanges failed to get enough feedback from market participants on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests and clearing.
The price swings have put some of the 
. Many of the biggest firms won’t offer clearing for the futures contract right away.

Title: Disney and Comcast Fight for Sky's Global Reach - Bloomberg

The biggest prize for Comcast Corp. and Walt Disney Co. in talks for 21st Century Fox Inc.’s assets -- even bigger than the studio that makes the X-Men movies or the network that airs “American Horror Story” -- may be a 39 percent stake in a European pay-TV service.
With 22.5 million customers in five countries and leading technology, 
 is suddenly a hot commodity in the battle over who buys the Murdoch film and TV empire. The interest marks a reversal in sentiment for the London-based media company almost a year to the day since Fox announced a bid for full control of Sky, whose shares were near their lowest point since 2012.
Sky offers Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, and 
, the biggest U.S. media company, something they both need at a time when new online TV competitors are surging around the world: a global footprint. Europe’s pay-TV market hasn’t been ravaged by cord-cutting like the U.S. industry, and some parts of the region are still growing. Sky’s subscriber base has been expanding in Germany and Italy.
“Media companies are increasingly becoming global in scale, with Netflix and Amazon leading the charge,” said Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst at Barclays Plc.
Fox’s Sky stake is valued at almost $9 billion, based on trading Friday. Disney and Comcast’s talks to acquire Fox’s studio, cable channels such as FX, Star India and National Geographic, and the Sky stake have been valued at $40 billion to $60 billion, depending on how much debt is included. 
Comcast considers Sky’s technology superior to European rivals, a key reason it’s 
 in buying Fox’s assets, according to person familiar with the matter. Sky’s Now TV, a streaming service that doesn’t rely on beaming programming over satellite, offers lessons as Comcast dips its toes into the online world. And as brands shift spending online, Sky’s advertising platform is helping it hold onto marketing dollars by offering clients ways to reach specific demographics.
Both companies also produce original programming. Sky subscribers get exclusive shows like the drama “Riviera,” starring Julia Stiles. Comcast owns the U.S. broadcast network NBC, home to “This Is Us,” and has the rights to the Olympics and National Football League games.
With Comcast as its owner, Sky would be able to negotiate better terms for carrying networks on pay TV, such as in deals with Fox, 
 or 
’s HBO, said Mostyn Goodwin, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants in London.
“There are obvious synergies back into the Comcast cable business and into the NBC channels business,” Goodwin said.
Meanwhile, Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has talked about the need for his company to sell its content directly to consumers. Disney even once considered buying 
 for that reason. Disney could use Sky’s large subscriber base to help market the subscription video services it plans to launch in the next two years. 
“Disney could look at Sky as the necessary piece to significantly accelerate its global OTT push,” Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a recent note, using the industry term for online video services.
Sky’s clout in sports fits naturally with both Disney and Comcast. As the dominant broadcaster of British soccer, Sky holds some of the world’s most valuable sports rights contracts.
Disney’s ESPN plans to unveil a subscription video service next year and could add Sky’s soccer content to that, said Barton Crockett, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. Adding Sky’s rights to a direct-to-consumer subscription package for soccer fans that Comcast’s NBC Sports started this year would bolster that service, too. NBC has a similar service for rugby -- a sport that would play well to Sky’s British base.
But owning Sky would also expose Disney and Comcast to the 
 costs of soccer TV rights -- a challenge that threatens them in the U.S. as they lose pay-TV subscribers. The 70 percent increase in the cost of U.K. Premier League matches at the most recent auction in 2015 caused a 6.2 percent drop in Sky’s operating profit. Further inflation is a risk, given potential bids from deep-pocketed tech giants like 
 and 
.
It’s also not clear whether Disney or Comcast would need to reapply through British regulators to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that Fox doesn’t already own, with Fox’s bid currently under review. Both companies are interested in owning all of Sky, not just Fox’s 39 percent stake.
Either way, the flurry of interest is good news for Sky investors. With Fox’s 10.75 pounds-a-share bid for the company still on the table and likely acting as a minimum valuation, Sky’s shareholders could be in line for a payout of up to 12 pounds a share if a deal with either Disney or Comcast is done, said Alex DeGroote, a media analyst at Cenkos Securities.
“Comcast, Disney, all these companies, they have synergies to offer that would need to be reflected in any deal for Sky,” DeGroote said.
The prospect of a bigger payout for Sky shareholders wasn’t envisioned by analysts a year ago. Fox’s bid came after a 30 percent drop in Sky shares since the beginning of 2016, over concerns about sports-rights inflation and perceived risks tied to the U.K.’s exit from the European Union.

Title: NYSE Owner Says ‘We May Be Stupid’ for Waiting on Bitcoin Futures - Bloomberg

The owner of the New York Stock Exchange and some of the largest futures markets in the world said he may regret not creating a futures contract based on bitcoin as competitors CME Group Inc., Cboe Global Markets Inc. and Nasdaq Inc. have done.
“We may be stupid for not being first on that,” Jeff Sprecher, chief executive officer of Intercontinental Exchange Inc., said today at an investor conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York. “I don’t have the answers, I wish I knew” how the investments will evolve, he said. “I don’t know what to make of cryptocurrencies.”
Cboe plans to start trading bitcoin futures on Dec. 10 while CME Group has set Dec. 18 as its start date. The moves may entice more professional traders and investors to join the cryptocurrency market by shifting transactions onto regulated exchanges. Bitcoin itself is currently bought and sold on platforms that are virtually unregulated, which has made some money managers uncomfortable with the market even as prices soar.
Sprecher questioned the existence of natural sellers of bitcoin futures, or investors who short the contract. Much of the wealth in the bitcoin world has been amassed by data miners in China and algorithmic traders, he said.
“To short that, that means they’re deciding to exit” the market through a futures market, Sprecher said. He decided that may not be a good scenario for one of his exchanges.
Still, he said that Intercontinental Exchange hasn’t necessarily missed an opportunity. He said it’s unwise to rush to market with a product whose underlying price is based on an index of bitcoin exchanges that aren’t transparent.
The CME 
 will settle in cash and use a daily price from the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, which is supported by digital exchanges Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken. Missing from that list is Gemini, one of the other large global exchanges, which struck a deal with Cboe for bitcoin pricing.

Title: Inside Banks, Bitcoin Futures Are Riling Trading Executives - Bloomberg

Bitcoin is coming to Wall Street on Sunday, and some executives at the world’s biggest banks aren’t sleeping well.
With just a few days left until 
 debuts futures contracts on the cryptocurrency, many banks are still weighing whether to offer them to clients -- and if so, how to handle the mechanics. Several of the largest firms, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., aren’t immediately offering clearing of the futures as they wait to see how it will work, according to people briefed on the plans.
In interviews, some executives and traders said their desks are eager to get in on the action -- but most sounded cautionary notes, ticking off concerns and unanswered questions. Bitcoin’s violent price swings this week have made the new market look all the more dangerous.
All of the people -- speaking from a half-dozen major firms -- asked not to be named, in some cases saying they’re worried about contradicting their bosses’ public statements. Others said it’s still too early to take a position. These are a few of their top concerns: 
Some bank CEOs and industry leaders have spent months deriding bitcoin publicly -- “it’s a 
,” “the very definition of a 
” or an “index for 
” -- and who knows what they’ve said privately. Now, what will it look like if firms help clients into investments that blow up? How might internal commentary over the futures sound if it ever spills into legal cases? One executive, for example, privately referred to the cryptocurrency as “sh*tcoin.”
Enthusiasts say bitcoin is a currency. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission says it’s a commodity. So does 
. So it may seem natural for trading desks in those markets to handle the new contracts. But one executive said there’s at least an argument to be made that equities desks (and delta one traders specifically) are used to the math: Bitcoin is like a volatile stock, and futures, at least in some ways, are like the options that track it.
When asset prices are steady, it’s relatively straightforward for banks to make markets: Help a customer buy or sell an asset, and then take some time to find another client who wants to take an opposite position. But bitcoin is too radioactive for banks to hold -- it swings wildly within minutes and there’s no established model to account for it on the balance sheet. So banks will try to clear the new contracts, matching one investor with another. That can be tough. A few traders, for example, said many clients are only interested in shorting. That can make for a pretty hard day at the office: Without longs, the trades may be costly and hard to set up.
This was laid out in a letter this week from the Futures Industry Association, which said Cboe and larger exchange operator 
 are rushing the futures to market without a proper consideration of the risks. The trade group, made up of some of the world’s largest derivatives brokerages, said it was concerned that the cryptocurrency’s extreme volatility could lead investors to default if prices swing. That could sting firms that clear the contracts.
It’s going to be tough for big bureaucratic banks to figure out all of these mechanics -- and their own stomach for the business -- on a tight schedule. A person close to Goldman Sachs said on Thursday it will initially clear bitcoin contracts for certain clients on a case-by-case basis. Dutch lender ABN Amro Group NV said it will clear the futures for some clients who request specific approval, and said it has received fewer than 10 requests so far.
, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada are in the camp with JPMorgan and 
deciding not to offer clearing right away, people briefed on their plans said. At some other firms, executives said they may enter when ready. So if they do choose to wade in, it’ll be smooth. But will a small presence from big players give an advantage to nimbler, risk-friendly firms that embrace the new market out of the gate?

Title: Cboe Says It Will Start Bitcoin Futures Trading on Dec. 10, Giving it a Week of Exclusivity - Bloomberg

Cboe Global Markets Inc. said Monday it will start trading bitcoin futures on Dec. 10, after getting the green light last week from regulators.
That gives Cboe a week of exclusivity. The exchange operator’s larger Chicago rival CME Group Inc. has said its contracts will begin trading Dec. 18.
The introduction of futures from both Cboe and CME may entice more professional traders and investors to join the cryptocurrency market by shifting transactions onto regulated exchanges. Bitcoin itself is currently bought and sold on platforms that are virtually unregulated, which has made some money managers uncomfortable with the market even as prices soar.
CME, the world’s biggest exchange owner, and smaller venue Cboe, known for its VIX volatility products, were allowed to offer the products Friday after pledging to U.S. regulators that they comply with the law. The contracts will be subject to oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Bitcoin futures will begin trading 6 p.m. Sunday evening in New York, Chicago-based Cboe said in a statement.

Title: Why Arbitrage Traders Are Salivating Over Bitcoin Futures - Bloomberg

The proverbial free lunch is just sitting there in the hours-old bitcoin futures market. So why isn’t it being gobbled up?
Cboe Global Markets Inc.’s new contracts were priced as much as 13 percent higher than bitcoin itself since trading began Sunday night, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That should have arbitrage traders salivating, especially among market makers starving after their -- already successful and hugely profitable -- efforts to make other similar assets trade in lockstep. Pity the poor S&P 500 arb living off spreads well below 1 percent, or merger arbs in the U.S., where the median gap is just north of 1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Arbitrage will close that gap, but it will be days and weeks,” Cboe Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly said on Bloomberg Television Monday, less than a day after launching the product.
Arbs make money when two strongly related assets converge in price, selling the one they consider pricey, buying the other, profiting off the difference.
Their job is a little complicated with these futures. Bitcoin’s wild volatility makes it harder to predict where the most-active contract, which expires in January, will settle, Tilly added. Only a few thousand contracts have traded so far, perhaps not enough to exert much influence on the cryptocurrency. And some investors might be willing to pay a premium for futures on a regulated market instead of going to the trouble of creating accounts at bitcoin exchanges, which have been repeatedly hacked with millions of dollars worth of tokens stolen.
“People feel a lot more comfortable in the futures on the Cboe than on an unregulated exchange,” said Kevin Kelly, managing partner of Benchmark Investments, which analyzes futures markets to develop indexes. 
Then there’s the fact that when the Cboe contracts expire, buyers get cash, not bitcoin itself. When a derivative is cash-settled, that tends to weaken links to an underlying asset.
“If you’re doing a cash-settled future, it’s just a bet,” said Aaron Brown, a former managing director at quant hedge fund AQR Capital Management who invests in the cryptocurrency and writes for Bloomberg Prophets. “If that’s not related to any underlying physical transaction, the only people who want to do it are gamblers.” The wide arb spread is “a big issue. It’s an illiquidity, it has to go away.” 
Soon, Cboe won’t be the sole regulated exchange offering bitcoin futures. Rival CME Group Inc. will launch its own contracts on Dec. 18. And Nasdaq Inc. is planning to bring a competing product to market next year, Bloomberg News recently 
. 
The price gap between bitcoin and bitcoin futures won’t last forever, said Dave Weisberger, CEO of CoinRoutes, a cryptocurrency data and order routing company.
“The futures will ping-pong between premium and discount,” he said. “I suspect at some point, potentially triggered by a negative event, it will flip. Markets go up and down, and bitcoin has been no different. It’s just been fast.”

Title: Apple's Cook Kisses the Ring in China - Bloomberg

Tim Cook is desperate to hold onto any remaining scraps of the China market. That's a boon for the country's model for the internet, and the local players who dominate.
The Apple Inc. CEO, who last year stood up to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, took 
 this past weekend to kiss the ring and give his seal of approval for the way the government there tightly controls the flow of information.
Ren Zhengfei, Robin Li and Pony Ma ought to have been grinning like Cheshire cats. The chiefs of Huawei Technologies Co.
            

        , Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have been great beneficiaries of Chinese censorship. Restricting the flow of information, you see, has worked out to be a handy little tool of trade protectionism.
The three Chinese companies have not only embraced domestic rules but actively assisted in enforcing them. Google Inc., on the other hand, famously withdrew from China after it decided 
 with censorship rules, Facebook Inc. has been restricted from the start, while Apple has faced formidable headwinds from government and semi-government agencies. 
, 
, c
? Huh?
I wasn't at the speech, but footage does not show Cook's tongue in his cheek. It's irrelevant whether he believes the words that he spoke. What matters is that landing major overseas CEOs -- including Google's Sundar Pichai and Cisco Systems Inc.'s Chuck Robbins -- not only gave legitimacy to authorities, but sent a signal to domestic rivals that their turf is safe. There's no sign that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg attended the conference, but his embrace of The Chinese Way is 
Take Baidu. Revenue and profit have rebounded this year despite its search business model facing existential threats ranging from regulation to changing user behavior. That's because Baidu faces no credible competition in China, and derives negligible revenue from overseas. 
Huawei, whose Western competitors ought to include Apple and Cisco, not only has home ground advantage in China but gets favorable treatment from government-backed telcos for its equipment and handsets, and is probably a recipient of Chinese foreign aid that's channeled back into network infrastructure built by the company.
The greatest winner of all is Tencent. The social media giant has its tentacles throughout all aspects of Chinese culture, yet barely exists outside of the Great Firewall. And why should it? Although China may soon reach peak WeChat, the company is leveraging its user base by adding more services such as payments and ads -- safe in the knowledge that neither Facebook nor Google are coming anytime soon.
Google, Facebook and even Cisco could thrive even if they didn't bother too much with the world's second-largest economy. But Cook's Apple is a little different. Huawei is coming for it, and so too is ZTE Corp., not just in the U.S. but globally. Apple derives almost 60 percent of its revenue from outside its home country, including close to 20 percent from China.
That's why it's so notable that the chief of a U.S. devices maker agreed to deliver a keynote speech at a Chinese internet conference: Information may be restricted, but hardware still roams free. For now.

Title: As Brokers Line Up to Offer Bitcoin Futures, Others Are Quiet - Bloomberg

U.S. brokerages have a decision to make. Will they offer futures contracts tied to bitcoin -- the cryptocurrency viewed as a gold mine or bubble -- to clients?
and 
’s Ally Invest said they will offer the instruments to customers once they become available. Fidelity said it currently has no plans to do so. Other major firms declined to comment.
Bloomberg began asking firms about their intentions in the weeks before CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc. announced Friday that they’ve cleared hurdles to offer bitcoin futures. CME will start trading them Dec. 18, while Cboe hasn’t specified when it will begin. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission conferred with the exchanges as they set terms for the products, and the pair will work with the agency to keep tabs on the spot market for bitcoin.
Public interest in the digital coin has exploded this year, at times driving prices beyond $11,000. The new contracts promise to make it easier for mainstream investors to place bets on the volatile cryptocurrency’s rise -- or collapse.
“What’s exciting to us about it is it provides a two-sided market,” JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at Omaha, Nebraska-based TD Ameritrade, said in an interview last month. “With natural buyers and sellers, that helps to put a more reasonable volatility on the product.”
Futures that are offered on a highly regulated exchange may offer more individual investors the chance to get involved in the bitcoin world without some of the risks associated with trading and holding the underlying asset. Many cryptocurrency exchanges are largely unregulated and some have suffered from security and technology lapses.
“Ally Invest customers have specifically expressed interest in the futures product the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is planning to launch that is based on bitcoin,” Rich Hagen, the brokerage’s president, said in an emailed statement Nov. 28. “If the CME does launch this product, Ally Invest plans to offer it to current and new futures customers immediately.”
Boston-based Fidelity doesn’t currently have any plans to offer bitcoin futures trading for its brokerage customers, spokesman Steve Austin said. For clients who do trade or own cryptocurrencies, they can link with their Coinbase account and monitor their portfolio on the Fidelity site.
Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on whether they will offer bitcoin futures. Before Friday, Charles Schwab Corp. and E*Trade Financial Corp. declined to comment. They didn’t respond to additional messages after the CME and Cboe announcements.

Title: Atos Bids $5.1 Billion for Gemalto to Form French Tech Giant - Bloomberg

made a 4.3-billion-euro ($5.06 billion) unsolicited bid for 
 with the backing of the French state’s investment bank, seeking to create a European leader in cybersecurity, digital technologies and payment services.
Atos is 
46 euros a share in cash, 36 percent above Monday’s closing price. It called the offer friendly and said it wants to engage in discussions about a deal, which would be the biggest of the year between two European technology companies. Gemalto, a security software company that’s seen its stock battered this year by a series of profit warnings and operational setbacks, said it’s 
 the proposal, which it described as conditional.
Thierry Breton, the former French finance minister who runs Atos, said the company is “absolutely determined” to complete the transaction, and that it has the backing of Gemalto’s biggest shareholder, state-run investor 
. A representative for Bpifrance said the fund won’t comment on Atos’s bid, but welcomes consolidation of French technology players.
Gemalto’s shares had dropped 38 percent this year through Monday, after a March 
, an April warning that 
 was dipping, a July announcement of an impairment 
, and a 
 in September in presenting a new strategic plan. Atos, by contrast, had seen its stock jump 24 percent in the same period.
“We continue to do this on a friendly basis, but we are absolutely determined and we will do this transaction, because it’s good for Gemalto shareholders, because it’s good for Gemalto’s stakeholders and because it’s good for Atos shareholders,” Breton said Tuesday on a call with analysts. 
Atos has been on a buying spree in recent years in a bid to enter new regions and add a broader range of products, including in health care. And Gemalto’s shift from SIM cards to software and cybersecurity had initially paid off under Olivier Piou, the company’s previous chief executive officer, with the shares trading at about 60 euros when he announced his retirement last year. 
However, his successor, Philippe Vallee, has faced mounting challenges as it became clear that the company had overestimated the pace at which customers would shift to new technologies, especially the transition to chip-and-PIN bank cards in the U.S.
 of Gemalto climbed 34 percent to 45.38 euros at 2 p.m. in Amsterdam. Atos gained 6 percent to 132.05 euros in Paris.
Gemalto said it will review the bid and determine the best course of action before responding by Friday. The company has 
 Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. as an adviser and said there is no certainty the proposal will lead to a firm offer. While Gemalto is incorporated in Amsterdam, it was formed from the combination more than a decade ago of French and Luxembourg companies, and is run from France.
German billionaire siblings 
 and 
, whose investment companies combined own a bit more than 10 percent of Gemalto, will study the Atos offer “with care and composure,” a Quandt family spokesman said in an emailed statement. “As significant shareholders, we’re pleased that others too are recognizing the technological quality of Gemalto.”
The acquisition would be Atos’s largest since it was formed in 1997 from the merger of two French companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Breton said on a conference call with reporters on Monday he’s already secured financing from two banks for the deal. Atos will seek “industrial partnerships” to help turn around Gemalto’s troubled SIM business, he said.
“The deal would make sense even if management should give us more details on the strategy going forward and what it would do with some of Gemalto’s assets that could be non-core for Atos,” analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux wrote in a note. “Atos should now convince Gemalto shareholders to tender.”
Atos currently gets just 5.7 percent of its 11.7 billion-euro annual revenue from its big data and cybersecurity division. The French company beefed up its offering when it agreed to buy 
’s communications cybersecurity division in October. Gemalto generated annual sales of 3.1 billion euros in 2016.

Title: Bitcoin Wildness Highlights Worries as Futures Trading Nears - Bloomberg

Bitcoin’s poised to go legit. Is it really ready?
Three days before Cboe Global Markets Inc., one of the world’s biggest regulated exchanges, debuts futures on the cryptocurrency, it had one of its wildest sessions ever. On Coinbase Inc.’s GDAX exchange, prices zoomed up to almost $20,000 from $16,000 in only about 90 minutes -- then crashed back down. The largest digital currency is still up more than 16-fold this year, trading at 16,126.32 as of 11:52 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg composite pricing.
Coinbase, one of the largest U.S. online exchanges used by investors, temporarily crashed and continued to suffer from service delays. Trezor, a wallet service, tweeted that it’s having “minor issues” with its servers, while Bitfinex, the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, said on Twitter that it has been under a denial of service attack for several days and that it recently got worse.
Cboe and CME Group Inc. last week got permission to offer bitcoin futures. CME’s products launch Dec. 18.
The entrance of Cboe and CME is a watershed for bitcoin because many professional investors have been unwilling to do business on the unregulated platforms where bitcoin currently trades. Cboe and CME are regulated, potentially assuaging those concerns.
Some big traders had just warned about the impending introduction. On Wednesday, the Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- 
 were rushed without enough consideration of the risks.
The group outlined their concerns in an open letter, questioning whether the exchanges would be able to adequately police market manipulation for bitcoin futures. FIA added that the exchanges didn’t get enough industry feedback on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests, and clearing for the products before bringing them to market.
Laurie Bischel, a spokeswoman for CME, declined to comment.
Cboe worked with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to design and improve its contracts and “committed to continue to work closely with the CFTC to monitor trading and foster the growth of a transparent, liquid and fair bitcoin futures market,” according to a statement from the company.
Other trading experts have sounded alarm bells on the possibility of manipulation. The thinking goes that because cryptocurrency markets aren’t policed by a central regulator, cheaters could fly under the radar if they try to move the price of bitcoin on exchanges with scant volume.
The CFTC “has strong anti-manipulation rules for futures, but those won’t necessarily protect investors if the bitcoin cash markets are manipulated,” said Ty Gellasch, executive director of the Healthy Markets Association, an investor advocacy group.
Cboe’s contracts will be based off the price of bitcoin on the Gemini Exchange. CME is using four exchanges, including the Coinbase GDAX market where prices proved so volatile Thursday.
Both Cboe and CME have curbs in place to calm price swings. Cboe halts trading for two minutes if prices rise or fall 10 percent, and a five-minute halt kicks in at 20 percent. At CME, prices aren’t allowed to move more than 20 percent.
The futures appear to be getting a high-profile endorsement. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. plans to clear bitcoin futures contracts for certain clients when the derivatives go live in coming days, according to a person with knowledge of the firm’s plans.
Goldman Sachs, one of the largest firms helping clients buy and sell futures contracts, will act in an agency capacity and won’t serve as a market-maker or build inventory in the derivatives, said the person, who asked not to be identified talking about the plans. The decision to clear client trades will be made on a case-by-case basis, the person said.
“Given that this is a new product, as expected we are evaluating the specifications and risk attributes for the bitcoin futures contracts as part of our standard due diligence process,” Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for the bank, said in an emailed statement.
At Coinbase on Thursday, bitcoin was almost $3,000 pricier than the levels seen on other markets, a record high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The premium reflects surging demand from new investors flooding into the exchange as the fear of missing out on bitcoin’s massive gains this year intensify, said Bryce Weiner, a blockchain developer since 2013. Coinbase has added at least 300,000 users since just before the Thanksgiving holiday and almost tripled its customer base in the past year.
“Coinbase is the biggest consumer-facing exchange,” said Weiner, who plans to launch his own cryptocurrency exchange Alt Market Inc. “The rest of the ecosystem can’t keep up -- that’s how much money is flowing in right now.”

Title: Tokyo Financial Exchange Takes First Step Toward Bitcoin Futures - Bloomberg

One of Japan’s leading financial exchanges is starting preparations to launch bitcoin derivatives, echoing 
 that plan to list contracts tracking the cryptocurrency as soon as this month.
Tokyo Financial Exchange Inc., which counts JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Bank Plc among its trading participants, plans to create a working group to study cryptocurrencies in January, Chief Executive Officer Shozo Ohta told reporters late last week. The listing would require changes to the nation’s securities law, he said. In Japan, the start of a working group is typically the first step toward drafting legislation.
“Once the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act recognizes cryptocurrencies as financial products, we will list the futures as quickly as possible,” Ohta told reporters Dec. 1. “To achieve that, we will launch this working group to study various aspects, including bitcoin’s present status, its outlook, and what form it will take root in Japan’s society.”
The bourse, known as TFX, is independent of the nation’s main trading venue, the Japan Exchange Group Inc. that handles Nikkei 225 and Topix futures. TFX is used by institutional investors for Euroyen interest-rate futures, and is also used for currency and equity-index futures. Across all products, 3.5 million contracts were traded in November, according to its 
.
In April, Japan became one of the fastest-moving countries to roll out laws for cryptocurrencies, recognizing bitcoin as a legal means of exchange and enacting oversight of bitcoin exchanges. To date, 15 venues have received licenses from the Financial Securities Agency. Japanese exchanges by some estimates account for roughly half of global bitcoin trading volume, boosted by an unusual business model that doesn’t charge trading fees.

Title: Comcast Seeks Sky Ownership in Battle for Fox Assets - Bloomberg

 is interested in seeking full control of Sky Plc, part of the reason it’s vigorously pursuing a deal to acquire film and TV assets from 
 despite tough competition from rival bidder 
, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Fox’s international holdings, including its 39 percent stake in British pay-TV giant Sky Plc, are compelling to Comcast, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Comcast sees Sky’s technology as superior to most other pay-TV providers in Europe, much as the U.S. cable giant’s X1 platform outshines its competitor’s set-top boxes, the person said. X1 lets subscribers search for movies and TV shows through a Netflix-like user interface and a voice-activated remote control.
Disney is also interested in Fox’s assets outside the U.S., including Sky, which would offer either bidder the opportunity to run one of the biggest pay-TV providers in Europe.
Fox shares jumped 1.5 percent in late trading to $33.70 after Bloomberg’s report on Comcast’s interest in Sky.
Fox would 
 to sell some assets to Disney in part because it believes that deal would present fewer regulatory hurdles, people familiar with the matter said. But a tie-up between Disney and Fox isn’t guaranteed to get an easy pass through Washington, either.
Disney owns the largest film studio and the largest cable sports network, ESPN. Buying Fox’s studio and its numerous regional sports networks would make Disney an even larger player in Hollywood and sports broadcasting than a tie-up between Comcast and Fox, potentially inviting greater regulatory scrutiny. Philadelphia-based Comcast, however, is the largest cable provider in the U.S., and the Justice Department has shown it’s resistant to approving deals between big TV distributors and programmers after suing to block AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner Inc.
Fox’s board would also need to decide whether to own Comcast or Disney shares in an all-stock deal. In the past two years, Comcast stock would have been the better bet. The cable giant’s shares have risen 27 percent, while Disney has dropped 7.1 percent, during that time.
When Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts sets his sights on a deal, he rarely loses. In 2001, Roberts won a bidding war for AT&T Broadband, beating out AOL Time Warner Inc. and Cox Communications Inc. In 2011, Comcast beat out Fox and Disney for rights to air the Olympics. In 2014, Roberts swooped in at the last minute and trumped Charter Communications Inc.’s bid for Time Warner Cable Inc., catching Charter off guard. Comcast’s purchase was later blocked by regulators in Washington, and Time Warner Cable ultimately ended up in Charter’s hands.
Roberts met with Fox Executive Chairman 
 on Monday in New York to discuss the deal, the person said. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on their meeting.

Title: Bitcoin's Surge Prompts U.S. to Police It Like Other Commodities - Bloomberg

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has moved it out of the shadows of finance. The latest sign that its becoming part of the mainstream came Friday when a key U.S. agency proposed that trading be regulated much like other commodities.
Specifically, the 
 made clear to market participants that there could be penalties if they can’t show buyers can take physical control of purchased digital coins in 28 days -- a framework that already applies to wheat, oil and gold.
The long-existing rules that require traders and exchanges to be able to deliver physical commodities has sowed some confusion for bitcoin because it’s an asset class that exists only in cyberspace. What makes the issue even more complicated is that many investors are amplifying their bets with margin, or borrowed money.
Bitcoin has jumped more than 1,700 percent in 2017, captivating everyone from retail investors to Hollywood celebrities. The digital currency has advanced 82 percent this month alone, a rise fueled by the CFTC’s decision to allow bitcoin futures to begin trading on exchanges run by CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc.
In its 
, which the CFTC will seek public comment on for 90 days, the regulator said that if a trader can’t take possession of a virtual currency bought on margin within about a month, the transaction will be treated as a futures contract. Futures contracts are subject to strict CFTC oversight, and failing to register them could subject firms to fines.
The CFTC’s proposed guidance could apply to U.S. exchanges or transactions overseas involving Americans.
“The commission regulates retail commodity transactions, with the exception of contracts of sale that result in actual delivery within 28 days,” the CFTC said in a 23-page document. “The commission considers virtual currency to be a commodity.”
The CFTC said it has faced questions about its views on the delivery of bitcoins since it 
 Bitfinex, one of the biggest digital token markets, last year.
The regulator said Bitfinex broke the law because digital coins weren’t provided to buyers in the required time frame. Instead, the platform “held the purchased bitcoins in bitcoin deposit wallets that it owned and controlled,” according to the CFTC. Bitfinex agreed to pay $75,000 to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations.
Friday’s proposal is the latest move by the CFTC to police virtual currencies, whose surge this year has largely caught regulators 
. CME, the world’s biggest exchange operator, plans on Monday to begin offering cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts. Earlier this month, the regulator said it would allow the CME contracts to start trading, as well as futures from Cboe, after they pledged that the products don’t run afoul of the law.

Title: Fox Favors Disney For the Sale of Its Studio, Media Assets - Bloomberg

, the global film and TV company controlled by the Murdoch family, would prefer to sell some assets to 
 because it’s a better strategic fit and presents fewer regulatory hurdles, people familiar with the matter said.
The family is holding talks with Disney, as well as Comcast Corp., about combining certain media businesses with the potential buyers, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The assets would include the 20th Century Fox film and TV studio and Fox’s stake in the U.K. pay-TV provider Sky Plc, they said. They don’t include Fox News, the Fox broadcast network or the Fox Sports 1 channel.
A deal could open the door for James Murdoch, Fox’s chief executive officer, to join Disney. The Murdochs aim to make a decision by the end of the year, the people said. Whether they pursue a transaction will depend on the price and structure, they said.
The Murdochs -- 
, 86, and his sons James and Lachlan, Fox’s top officers -- are considering a sale as the market 
 the group below slower-growing peers. A deal would dramatically expand Disney’s global reach, giving the world’s largest entertainment company control of Sky, Star India and U.S. cable channels including FX and National Geographic.
CNBC reported Tuesday that an agreement between the companies could come as soon as next week, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter. The enterprise value for the assets is seen above $60 billion, the people said, according to CNBC.
Fox, based in New York, declined to comment. Disney, based in Burbank, California, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
As speculation mounted that a deal is close, shares of both Fox and Sky surged. Fox rose as much as 4.3 percent to $33.69 in New York trading, while Sky rallied up to 3.8 percent. Disney traded down 1.3 percent to $108.78 as of 10 a.m. in New York.
A deal would shuffle ownership of prized film and TV assets at a time when changing viewer habits are pressuring the television industry’s subscriber and advertising revenue. If an agreement is reached, Disney could also gain majority ownership of Hulu, an online streaming service that competes with Netflix.
As Fox’s CEO, James Murdoch has battled a series of scandals at the company, including sexual harassment allegations at the top of Fox News that have added regulatory scrutiny to the company’s 11.7 billion-pound ($15.8 billion) bid for the rest of Sky.
Authorities are considering the takeover’s potential impact on media plurality in Britain and whether Sky News would adhere to broadcasting standards under Fox ownership. Critics of Fox have appeared before the U.K.’s Competition & Markets Authority, bringing up concerns over a 2011 phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch-owned newspapers, which scuppered Fox’s first bid for Sky, and the harassment allegations at Fox News.
If Disney or another strategic bidder buys Fox’s 39 percent stake in Sky, it would trigger a mandatory offer for the rest under U.K. Takeover Panel rules, and would probably be approved quickly by regulators, analysts at UBS led by Polo Tang 
 Monday in a note..
The Fox assets in play are worth almost $50 billion, according to Alan Gould, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities Inc., and could translate into a 25 percent stake in Disney if they agree to a stock deal. That would potentially reduce the tax liability for Fox shareholders, including the Murdochs.
The talks are occurring against the backdrop of a U.S. Justice Department suit to block AT&T Inc.’s proposed $85 billion acquisition of 
 The government has said the merger of a large TV distributor and producer would stifle competition and hurt consumers.
A deal with Disney might overcome some of those challenges. Disney doesn’t sell TV services directly to consumers in the U.S. Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has had success acquiring movie studios such as Pixar Animation and 
 and a Fox deal could give Disney a controlling stake in the Hulu video-streaming service.

Title: Bitcoin Rises After CME, CBOE Move Ahead on Listing Futures - Bloomberg

Bitcoin rose after CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc. said they will offer 
 contracts as soon as this month, capping a record-breaking week that made the digital currency the focus of investors from Wall Street to Main Street.
“This is going to bring large sums of money in this area,” said Naeem Aslam, a chief market analyst at TF Global Markets in London. “It sends the message that the product does have some regulation around it and it is trading on the same exchange where other reputable derivatives are.”
The world’s largest digital currency has surged about 30 percent this week, reaching a record high of $11,434 on Nov. 29. The gains came with volatile intraday price swings of as much as 20 percent as online exchanges struggled to handle the surging interest and as warnings of an asset bubble intensified. The currency has risen more than 11-fold this year.
“It will be interesting. I think it’s generally positive,” billionaire venture capitalist Mark Cuban said in an email. “What they charge is critical. Transaction costs are relatively high for bitcoin. If this pushes transaction costs lower it will be a benefit to the bitcoin market.”
The move forward on futures is a watershed for Wall Street professionals -- including institutional investors and high-speed traders -- who’ve been eager to bet on cryptocurrencies and their wild swings. But the new products will also spur federal regulation, with the contracts announced Friday subject to oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The exchanges promised to help the agency surveil the underlying bitcoin market.
Under a process called self-certification the exchanges assured the CFTC that the new products complied with the rules. While it doesn’t technically require CFTC approval, the regulator could have stayed their plans if they weren’t satisfied. Friday’s announcement allows them to go forward.
Bitcoin, created in 2009, excited early investors with its potential use as a global currency, free from bank fees and government control. Transactions take place person-to-person around the world -- anywhere there’s Internet access.
There are other ways the new futures could spur more vigorous oversight of the cryptocurrency. The contracts, for example, could make it easier to create an exchange-traded fund tied to bitcoin -- even after a previous attempt was knocked down.
