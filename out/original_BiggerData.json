The 
, which has made a record lending in India in 2017, plans to fund over one billion euros to projects including renewable energy over the next two years.
“In the last five years alone, we have done 1.7 billion euros in financing, of which one billion euros of approvals was done this year alone,” Donal Cannon, Head of EIB in South Asia, said in an interview on Tuesday. “We hope to do something less than a billion euros each for the next two years,” he said.
The bank has a portfolio of nearly two billion euros in India with half of it in renewable projects and the rest in urban transport. EIB will be looking to invest in solar manufacturing, energy storage, electric vehicles, maritime transport and off-shore wind power.
EIB and

 a joint $400 million fund to provide 15-year debt to solar and wind projects.
While eligible solar projects have already been identified in states of Rajasthan, Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka, additional wind and solar projects are currently being examined.

=== Title: Steinhoff Losing Credit Lines as Accounting Scandal Deepens - Bloomberg ===

Embattled retailer 
 said lenders are starting to cut off support after an accounting scandal swept out its leaders and destroyed most of its value in a matter of days.
The owner of Conforama in France, Mattress Firm in the U.S. and Poundland in the U.K. isn’t yet able to assess the magnitude of financial irregularities disclosed two weeks ago, it said in a 
 to lenders in London on Tuesday. The South African company also said it didn’t know when it would be able to publish audited results for 2017 and 2016, nor whether additional years will need to be restated.
The shares resumed their plunge, slumping by more than 20 percent in Frankfurt to the lowest since Dec. 8 before paring losses to trade 12 percent lower as of 2:48 p.m. local time.
The presentation shows that the company is still grappling with the task of getting to the bottom of the crisis, which has led to the resignations of Chief Executive Officer Markus Jooste and billionaire Chairman Christo Wiese. Steinhoff said earlier Tuesday that Chief Operating Officer Danie van der Merwe, 59, had been made interim CEO to helm the recovery attempt, while Conforama boss Alexandre Nodale will serve as his deputy in a new four-member management board.
Steinhoff didn’t have “detailed visibility” of the cash flows of individual operating companies, it said in the same presentation. The units rely on the company for working capital and “the forecast position for each operating company is evolving daily,” it said. PricewaterhouseCoopers has been hired to investigate the accounts, while AlixPartners LLP is working on an analysis of the cash flow.

Steinhoff had outstanding debt of 10.7 billion euros ($12.7 billion) as of Dec. 14, the company said. Almost 4.8 billion euros of that was in Steinhoff Europe AG, an operation based in Austria. About 690 million euros in notional facilities have been rolled over to date, according to the presentation.

=== Title: Billionaire Charoen's Unifying Bet - Bloomberg ===

After five years of frenzied dealmaking, Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi's shopping bag is looking full. But for a school dropout whose first business was to hang around his dad's oyster omelette shop collecting 
, there's no telling where this tycoon's ambition will take him next.
Charoen's last-visited destination is Vietnam, where his flagship Thai Beverage Pcl is close to 
 a majority stake in Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp.
That win marks a fresh milestone in a journey that began in 2012, when Singaporean lender Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. and a subsidiary 
 a chunk of Fraser & Neave Ltd. to ThaiBev, giving Charoen just the opening he needed to battle Indonesian billionaire Mochtar Riady for control of the drinks maker.
Not just that. Charoen's move so spooked Heineken NV that it was forced into an expensive buyout of Asia Pacific Breweries Pte, its joint venture with F&N and the maker of Tiger beer.
By 2015, Charoen was already expanding his regional footprint by using a holding company to 
 Metro AG's Cash & Carry business in Vietnam after shareholders of Berli Jucker Pcl, his Thailand-listed trading firm, 
 at the $876 million transaction. Yet skeptics were left speechless when, in 2016, the same Berli Jucker raised 
 in debt to buy French grocer Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA's stake in Thai retailer Big C Supercenter Pcl, the second-biggest consumer M&A transaction in Southeast Asia in the past five years.
And now, the deal of 2017 -- Saigon Beer. Apart from owning the Metro Cash & Carry stores in Vietnam, Charoen has already amassed a big stake in Vietnam Dairy Products JSC, or Vinamilk, through F&N.
He's entrenching himself further in the communist nation by acquiring an interest of around 54 percent in its largest brewer for $4.8 billion, skirting the government's 49 percent cap on foreign investment. Apparently, the liquor mogul is using a locally incorporated vehicle to do the deal. As 
, despite heavy offshore interest initially from the likes of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and Japan's Asahi Group Holdings Ltd., a 57 percent surge in Sabeco's stock this year -- plus the prospect of only a minority shareholding -- put off many buyers.
The idea of a seamless Southeast Asian market -- the so-called Asean Economic Community -- hasn't exactly set the imagination of businessmen or bankers on fire. Charoen, though, seems to be a believer in the region's 600 million consumers.
When you throw his recent agreement to buy 
 of Myanmar's leading whisky brand from U.S. private equity firm TPG Capital LP into the mix, as well as the purchase of 
 in Thailand from Yum! Brands Inc., it becomes quite clear that Charoen's ultimate goal is to build a Southeast Asian food-and-beverage empire, with tentacles going forward into retail and stretching back into logistics and, yes... packaging and bottling.
Hidden somewhere in Charoen's $17.3 billion of personal net worth are those bottle caps after all.

=== Title: How Tesla's Model X Stacks Up Against China's New NIO - Bloomberg ===

Chinese startup NIO marked its entry last week into the world’s biggest market for electric cars with a sport utility vehicle priced cheaper than 
’s Model X.
Set up about three years ago, NIO is among the youngest companies to join the global EV melee as regulators worldwide crack down on emissions and countries, including China, consider phasing out automobiles powered by gasoline and diesel. In China, NIO will also be competing against giants including Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., besides local rivals such as BYD Co.
When it comes to taking on the the might of Elon Musk’s Model X, the NIO’s new ES8 is no shrinking violet, accelerating from 0-100 Kmph in a sprightly 4.4 seconds, compared to the Tesla’s more sedate 6.3 seconds.
It beats the Model X when it comes to charging speed too, filling the battery with juice in just 1.1 hours, compared to Tesla’s 4.5 on a speed charge.
So, here’s how the seven-seater ES8 stacks up against the Model X:
NIO is promising features and services to reassure buyers that they won’t be left stranded in the middle of nowhere after running out of battery charge. Owners of the ES8 can charge their car by swapping batteries at power-swap stations in three minutes or recharge with the help of “Power Mobile” service vehicles that travel to motorists.
The startup plans to build more than 1,100 power-swap stations in China by 2020 and have more than 1,200 “Power Mobile” service vehicles. A battery-swap station can be assembled within a day, according to Li. The carmaker will also offer other free services including on-road assistance.
Founded by William Li and a group of internet entrepreneurs in 2014, NIO has raised more than $1 billion from investors led by

, CITIC Capital Holdings Ltd. and 

=== Title: Bitcoin Climbs as Futures Debut Fails to Incite Attack by Shorts - Bloomberg ===

The arrival of a new futures contract that makes it easier to place short bets on bitcoin wasn’t enough to undercut the cryptocurrency’s march toward $20,000.
The digital token, up about 20-fold this year, added another 4.8 percent from its New York close on Friday to $18,379 as of 9:24 local time, according to prices on Bloomberg. That was in line with its new contract for January delivery, which at $18,650.
Bitcoin touched a record $19,511 just minutes before CME Group Inc. began offering 
 Sunday evening in a move that broadens the market for institutional traders and makes it easier to sell the cryptocurrency short.
Still, impediments remain to betting on a dive. The Chicago-based futures exchange, the world’s biggest, required a 47 percent initial margin, or almost $50,000, for opening trades on a five-bitcoin future. Settlement terms are spurring some participants to question whether futures will move fully in line with the underlying asset.
“In theory, it does open it up to shorting opportunities, but as always, the devil is in the detail,” said Jeremy Goldwyn, a managing director at Hong Kong-based commodities and financial futures brokerage Bands Financial Ltd. “I’m not totally convinced that this offers a clear enough link to enable people to play the short side and still reap the financial benefit at settlement.”
The CME contract, like the futures offered by Chicago-based rival Cboe Global Markets Inc. a 
 requires cash settlement against a CME-fixed reference price on expiration. That’s in contrast to settling with physical delivery of bitcoin, which might allow a trader to lock in their upside exposure. The future is based off four price sources.
“People have to be comfortable with the reference price of the contract, and there may be a basis risk,” Goldwyn said, referring to the potential for non-synchronized price movements.
The 
 also limits the minimum price fluctuation to $25.
Even so, the CME debut was carried out smoothly, with the contract’s volatility staying below its circuit-breaker thresholds. The Cboe contract was hit with trading pauses on the first day.
Of course, potential shorts may just be nervous about getting caught on the wrong side of 2017’s hottest asset. It’s up almost 2,000 percent this year, with no sign that the parabolic rise is coming to an end.
“Futures have definitely opened bitcoin up to shorting opportunities,” said John Butler, head of wealth services for Toronto-based GoldMoney Inc., which offers bitcoin and gold custodian and storage services. “But shorting something with this much momentum would be brave.”

=== Title: Trump Nominee Who Struggled to Answer Basic Questions Withdraws - Bloomberg ===

Washington (AP) -- A Trump judicial nominee whose inability to answer basic legal questions at his confirmation hearing brought him widespread ridicule has withdrawn his nomination, a White House official said Monday.
Matthew Petersen, nominated by President Donald Trump to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, became an internet sensation after the video of his confirmation hearing — during which Petersen was unable to define basic legal terms — was posted online.
In his resignation letter to the president, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Petersen said that while he was honored to have been nominated for the position, "it has become clear to me over the past few days that my nomination has become a distraction — and that is not fair for you or your Administration."
"I had hoped that my nearly two decades of public service might carry more weight than my two worst minutes on television," he went on to say. "However, I am no stranger to political realities, and I do not wish to be a continued distraction from the important work of your Administration and the Senate."
The letter was dated Saturday.
During the confirmation hearing, Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican, pressed Petersen, a member of the Federal Election Commission who testified he had never tried a case, on his qualifications to the bench.
Kennedy said in an interview Monday with WWL-TV in New Orleans that Trump called him Saturday and said he did not personally interview Petersen. Trump, according to Kennedy, said his staff chose the nominees.
"He has told me, 'Kennedy, when some of my guys send someone who is not qualified, you do your job,'" Kennedy said in the interview.
Kennedy said he had no idea that Petersen lacked the experience for the post.
"Just because you've seen 'My Cousin Vinny' doesn't qualify you to be a federal judge," Kennedy said, a reference to the 1992 movie in which an inexperienced lawyer played by Joe Pesci tries — and wins — a big case. "And he has no litigation experience. And my job on the judiciary committee is to catch him. I would strongly suggest he not give up his day job."

This story has been corrected to show the nominee's last name is Petersen, not Peterson.

=== Title: Cyril Ramaphosa a Better Bet Than Zuma But Don't Lose Your Head - Bloomberg ===

Cyril Ramaphosa's narrow victory in attaining the presidency of the ruling African National Congress party has set South African markets alight as political uncertainty looks to be diminishing. But there's a risk of investors jumping the gun. Many steps are needed before the country is set on a proper growth path. 
To take real power, Ramaphosa has to replace current State President Jacob Zuma. That could happen as soon as Jan. 5-7 at the ANC's National Executive Committee. A delay to that or, worse, Zuma seeing out his full term until 2019 would be a blow.
The 10-year bond yield has dropped 60 basis points this week and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Top 40 was ahead by 1.3 percent Tuesday, led by bank stocks. The rand has appreciated 10 percent versus the U.S. dollar in the past month.
The currency outperformed analysts' expectations in the first and second quarters, according to surveys compiled by Bloomberg. This week's rally puts it about 10 percent ahead of where the consensus estimate expected it to end the year. 
The appointment of a credible finance minister, such as previous office-holder Pravin Gordhan, will be the crucial step to maintaining investor confidence and avoiding recession. Also pivotal will be a possible reprieve from Moody's Investors Service, which has been expected to downgrade the country's rating in late February from BBB+.
S&P Global Ratings downgraded the country to junk on Nov. 24. If Moody's follows, South Africa will bounce out of the World Government Bond Index and force many bond funds to liquidate their South African holdings.
South Africa's high interest rates are a major impediment to Ramaphosa's ambitious plans to boost annual growth to 5 percent by 2023 and to an already ambitious 3 percent next year, and create a million new jobs. 
But the outlook has improved. The chance that the economy will fall into recession next year has more than halved since mid-year, with the median forecast declining to just 20 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey published last week.
Reducing unemployment from a 14-year high of almost 30 percent would help the ANC keep its monopoly on power at the 2019 elections—hence Ramaphosa's ascendancy as a better bet than Zuma to achieve that. Markets take a similar view. 
Much-needed economic modernization includes substantive action on corruption, tax reforms to promote hiring, youth apprenticeships and a new relationship with big employers such as the mining industry. Reforming state-owned enterprises will be fundamental. In Ramaphosa's words, they've been acting as if under "state capture."
South Africa's financial markets are pricing in a lot of change, though. For the recent enthusiasm to be sustained, swift and substantive action will be needed from the experienced Ramaphosa, while Zuma must leave the stage elegantly. The risk of a sudden reversal remains high.

Will we look back on 2017 as the year we lost our faith in the belief that technology can “do no harm?” Whether it was the 
 of toxic workplace culture found in Silicon Valley darlings, much-hyped products that

 of artificial intelligence, or the omnipresent conundrum of 
, the tide seems to be turning against the digital apologists.
 
It’s no secret that for less than a hundred dollars, you can get a perfectly decent-looking, decent-sounding Bluetooth speaker. This year, New York-based startup Master & Dynamic threw down the gauntlet with its release of the MA770, designed by architect David Ajaye. Created with custom-made concrete, this speaker weighs 35 pounds and makes a strong impression, even with the sound off. (Read our full review

The company that invented the Game Boy has upped its on-the-go trademark with the Nintendo Switch. Sure, it doesn’t have robust online features such as those found in Assassin’s Creed or Call of Duty, but that’s also kind of the point: The pared-back approach pays immediate dividends for its bestselling franchises, such as Mario and Zeld. The two games have gotten significant upgrades—and new storylines—that will appeal to longtime fans while drawing in younger ones who aren’t ready for the intensive environment of Xbox or Playstation but have outgrown Temple Run and Candy Crush. 
 
You work hard. You come home late with take-out. And you want a glass of wine. Good wine, though, because you’re not an animal. But good wine needs time to breathe. The Breville Sommelier is a stylish glass decanter sitting on a compressor base that forces oxygen-rich air through the vino. Voilá: An hour’s worth of breathing done in one minute. A recent test on a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape mellowed that particular wine’s polarizing black walnut notes without sacrificing complexity. 
 
The look of the Mina, the new espresso machine from Italy’s

But the old world design and construction are fused with such high-tech features as a proportional integral derivative (PID)-controlled boiler that can regulate water temperature down to the tenth of a degree and an app interface that gives the user unprecedented control of the rate at which that water flows through the ground espresso. Crowning the machine is an industrial-style lever for manually controlling water flow—providing the espresso-making equivalent of the mechanical satisfaction of driving a stick shift. It’s also available in 11 colors. 
 
It was a big year for flagship phones that pushed pushed the envelope, both in terms of price and technology. On the numbers alone, the Google Pixel 2 and the iPhone X were indeed hard to beat. But for a combination of performance, price, and stunning industrial design, nobody came close to the Essential this year. Yes, the dual camera system’s software was woefully under-baked when released, but it has improved to the point that photos are now a draw, not a drawback. This is a phone that has to be held to be appreciated, though. The glossy, ceramic back and satisfying heft and solidity that come from its titanium frame make it feel like no other. 
 
Big things do come in small packages. In this case, a bright, vivid, high-definition (HD) image, up to 140 inches diagonally, from a projector the size of a loaf of Wonder Bread. The best part?

=== Title: Farmers Sue to Reinstate Obama Lawsuit Rule Trump Killed - Bloomberg ===

Last year, rural Americans who believed Donald Trump’s promises to help small farmers played a key role in putting him in the White House. Since then, the Republican administration’s Department of Agriculture moved to block an Obama-era rule that provided those farmers with a powerful tool to fight anti-competitive conduct by big agriculture. So now some of those farmers have sued.
The rule in question would have helped independent farmers, such as poultry growers, to sue massive, vertically integrated meat companies that control every step of the production process. The American chicken farmer largely exists at the whim of mass producers that, under a contract, give them feed and chicks to raise in exchange for pay. Under current law, if one of those farmers has a gripe because, for example, he or she believes unhealthy chicks were sent as retaliation for a complaint about the contract, courts require a showing that the whole market—and not just the lone farmer—was hurt by the company’s actions.
Under the Obama-era rule, which had yet to take effect, that standard would have changed to require only a showing of harm to the farmer claiming it. Many small farmers and groups that represent them, such as the 
, Rural Advancement Foundation International-USA, 
, R-CALF USA, the U.S. Cattlemen’s Association and the Organization for Competitive Markets, largely supported the rule proposed by the Democratic administration. They argued that the rules would help level the playing field, making it easier for a small farmer to take on international corporations.
Industry lobbying groups, such as the National Chicken Council and the North American Meat Institute, opposed the Obama rule, citing concerns that corporations would face more litigation and thus trigger higher prices for consumers.
In October, the USDA and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue decided not to move forward with the Obama rule, leaving the existing, higher bar in place. The petition by the farmers was filed Dec. 14 with the U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis.
“I’m quite disappointed in the fact that the president hasn’t followed through on promises to help the little guy, including family farmers,” said Mike Weaver, a poultry farmer in West Virginia, president of the Organization for Competitive Markets and self-proclaimed Trump voter. “If it takes legal action to accomplish things that should be done otherwise, then that’s what we’re going to do.”
His organization is being represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation, a nonpartisan group that has sued a number of federal agencies this year, including the Department of Defense, the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Education.
“One of the reasons we’re really interested in this case is because it has such tremendous and direct impact on small and independent farmers to compete in the market,” said Aman George, director of legal policy at Democracy Forward. The litigation claims the withdrawal was illegal because it didn’t establish a clear record as to why it was done and was thus arbitrary and capricious. Plus, because the Obama rule was promulgated as a result of the 2008 Farm Bill, the decision to toss the regulation is unlawful, according to the complaint. The USDA declined to comment.
Such a lawsuit won’t be a slam dunk. “In terms of the prospects for success, well, there’s no guarantee one way or another,” said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Program on Regulation. Neither theory, he said, points decisively in one direction or the other. “Both are spongy legal doctrines.”
If anything, Coglianese said, he’d expect the court to rule in the government’s favor. “There’s a general degree of deference to the agencies,” he said. 
The better bet is probably a changed political landscape. “They definitely should be looking to mobilizing with regard to Congressional elections,” Coglianese said.
Weaver isn’t ready to commit to changing his political leanings, but he’s considering it. “If we can’t get the support from the Congress or the administration that we think farmers deserve, it’s certainly going to affect the way we vote,” he said. “If they won’t support us, we’ll see if we can get somebody who will.”

=== Title: Trump Asks ‘How’s Your 401(k)?’ But Most Voters Don’t Have One - Bloomberg ===

President Donald Trump is trying out a new campaign slogan: “How’s your 401(k) doing?” The answer for more than half of Americans is that they don’t have one.
Trump has tested out the line this month at a fundraiser, a campaign rally and in a White House meeting, predicting that the rising U.S. stock market will help him win re-election. But only about 45 percent of private-sector workers participate in any employer-sponsored retirement plan, and the lower-income workers in Trump’s political base are the least likely to hold money in such an account, 
 the Government Accountability Office.
Trump mentions the stock market almost daily in tweets or public remarks, taking direct credit for record highs by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other indexes. But only about 14 percent of U.S. families directly own stocks, an asset class dominated by the country’s top earners, according to the Federal Reserve.
Meanwhile, the president has also rolled back efforts to expand retirement savings options to more middle-class and low-income workers.
For a president propelled into office in no small part by resentment that a broad swath of the country has been left behind while an entrenched establishment prospers, continual references to the stock market and 401(k) accounts risk alienating his supporters, said Austan Goolsbee, a former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama.
“As a political slogan, ‘how is your 401(k) doing?’ suggests he’s most interested in the one-third of people who have a 401(k),” said Goolsbee, who teaches economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. “The more you highlight how great that group of financial winners is doing, you at least run the risk of angering and irritating the very people who revolted against what they perceived as the financial and political elites in the first place.”
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump’s statements reflect “a strong economy” that is “good news for everyone.”
“For the Americans that don’t have the opportunity to invest in a 401(k) plan or who choose not to, the Trump agenda of lower taxes, higher wages, and better jobs allows them to save more on their own, and potentially have a better chance of finding a job in the future that provides those benefits,” Walters added in an emailed statement.
An October Politico/Morning Consult poll found that only a 
 of voters think Trump “cares about people like me.” Trump’s tax overhaul, which Congress may send to his desk this week, is opposed by a two-to-one margin because independent analyses have found it largely benefits the wealthy, according to a 
 poll released Dec. 13.
Trump said he stumbled upon the new campaign slogan as he was preparing to speak to donors at Cipriani restaurant in New York earlier this month. Trump said that a law enforcement officer backstage at the fundraiser sparked the idea, but he didn’t identify the person by name.
“One great gentleman came up and he said, ‘Sir, I want to thank you.’ I said ‘what did I do for you?”’ Trump said on Dec. 2. “He said, ‘my 401(k) is up 40 percent.’ And I never thought of it. You know, I tell you, he gave me one of the great campaign lines. It’s called ‘How is your 401(k) doing?”’
Since then, Trump has tested the line at a Florida campaign rally and even asked members of the media about their own retirement accounts during a meeting in the Cabinet Room at the White House.
“And, by the way, how are your 401(k)s doing?” Trump said during a Dec. 8 rally in Pensacola, Florida, where median household income is about $46,000. “Not too bad, right?”
The line was met with light applause.
“I’m not sure he understands that only a fraction of the population has 401(k)s,” said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. “So he just may not realize that he’s speaking to the privileged few.”
Only a third of people contribute anything to their retirement accounts, according to a Census 
 released this year. Among workers in the bottom half of the income scale, less than 25 percent participate in a retirement program, according to the GAO.
With wages largely stagnant for most Americans in recent years, saving for retirement has been crowded out by other expenses. Student debt and auto loans are at record levels, according to Federal Reserve data released in February, and overall consumer debt is rising at the fastest pace in three years.
“You can give people all the tax-deferred accounts you want, but if they don’t have enough money it’s not going to work,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, and former chief economist to the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush.
Trump’s proposed tax cuts could help some people save more money for retirement by boosting their take-home pay, Holtz-Eakin said.
During debate over the legislation, Trump blocked efforts by Republicans in Congress to scale back tax preferences for retirement savings.
“There will be NO change to your 401(k),” Trump said on Twitter on Oct. 23, after reports that lawmakers were considering drastic reductions in the amount that could be deposited tax-free in the accounts. “This has always been a great and popular middle-class tax break that works, and it stays!”
But Trump’s administration has rolled back Obama-era proposals to expand retirement savings to the millions of low- and middle-income Americans who don’t have them.
Trump signed legislation in May repealing a regulation that would have made it easier for states to automatically enroll workers in retirement programs.
In July, the Treasury Department announced it was ending the myRA program begun under Obama to provide retirement savings options to those without access to traditional 401(k) plans. Treasury said the program suffered from low demand and high costs.
“We are committed to promoting retirement savings, and, as Treasurer, I plan to devote a substantial amount of my time to ensuring more Americans have the tools and know-how to save for retirement,” U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza said in a July 28 statement.
The Trump administration hasn’t announced any significant effort since then to expand access to retirement savings plans.

=== Title: Why South Africa's Steinhoff Could Be Next Enron: QuickTake Q&A - Bloomberg ===

It could wind up being South Africa’s version of the Enron accounting scandal. Furniture retailer 
 captivated investors by growing into a global force, latterly under its billionaire chairman, Christo Wiese. Now it’s drawing attention for all the wrong reasons. Shares in Steinhoff crashed 80 percent in two days after the company reported accounting irregularities that stretch back to 2016. Wiese has stepped down, Chief Executive Officer Markus Jooste has resigned and the company is looking for leniency from its creditors.
The company has been a go-to choice for investors seeking a balance between developing and emerging markets. Its share price tripled between early 2012 and end 2016 as it expanded in the U.S. and Europe from a base in South Africa. It owns retail chains including Conforama in France, Poundland in the U.K. and Mattress Firm in the U.S., which encompasses the stores formerly known as Sleepy’s. Reflecting the global deal-making, the company has at least 200 subsidiaries and affiliates and is Dutch-registered and listed in Frankfurt and Johannesburg. Wiese and Jooste, meantime, are among the best-known members of a close-knit group of wealthy businessmen who have owned properties in the exclusive winelands around Cape Town.
Details remain sketchy. Steinhoff has said the issues relate to the viability of about 6 billion euros ($7 billion) worth of assets on the balance sheet of operations in Europe. Earnings statements for at least fiscal 2017 and 2016 will need to be restated. A decade ago, in a 56-page research report, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. asked why Steinhoff’s accounts lacked “pivotal information” about where it was generating revenue and why it appeared to focus on tax breaks rather than the actual business. Susan Gawith, a portfolio manager who’s covered Steinhoff off and on for 18 years, said Steinhoff “reminds many in South Africa of Enron,” the U.S. energy company that went bust in 2001 after the revelation of systematic accounting fraud that kept debts off balance sheets.
The stock’s nosedive has wiped 12 billion euros off the company’s value. Bond yields blew out to more than 14 percent the week the scandal broke. And Moody’s Investors Service 
 the credit rating to junk.
Steinhoff is due to meet bankers in London on Tuesday in what will likely be a tempestuous confrontation. At least three of the retailer’s biggest lenders have indicated to the company that they would support rolling over more than 1 billion euros owed on a revolving credit facility, people familiar with the matter said last week. Steinhoff isn’t expected to publish earnings ahead of the meeting, but will instead provide an update on the “ongoing operational and financial situation.” Some of the global lenders include Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., HSBC Holdings Plc and BNP Paribas SA.
Steinhoff has hired PwC to investigate the wrongdoing and appointed Moelis & Co. to handle discussions with lenders and AlixPartners LLP to advise on operations. It earmarked assets that could be sold easily, if necessary, and offloaded a stake in South African investment holding company PSG Group Ltd., raising about $345 million. Steinhoff Africa Retail Ltd., a subsidiary known as STAR, is refinancing loans with its parent company that amount to about 16 billion rand ($1.3 billion), and has 
 of a deal to take control of Shoprite Holdings Ltd., a food retailer also controlled by Wiese. Three non-executive directors have been tasked with keeping a closer eye on governance. They include Steve Booysen, who was already head of the audit and risk committee.
Jooste and Wiese have both resigned, saying nothing about what went wrong. Auditor Deloitte LLP, which signed off the 2016 results that now need to be restated, has said it will fully cooperate with investigations.
South Africa’s Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors has begun a probe into the role of Deloitte’s local unit, while the Financial Services Board started an investigation into Steinhoff, backed by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. A number of law firms, backed by wealthy funders, 
 to persuade investors to join class-action lawsuits, promising not to charge fees unless the case is successful. German and Austrian prosecutors have been investigating possible accounting fraud since 2015.
The biggest loser in dollar terms is Wiese, Steinhoff’s largest shareholder, who has seen his 
 plunge to about $2 billion from more than $5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. South Africa’s Public Investment Corp., which manages pension funds of government workers, has a 10 percent stake, which translates to a loss of more than $1 billion. The share prices of related companies have also slumped, including STAR, PSG, Shoprite and Tradehold Ltd., another Wiese company. Bondholders now in possession of junk-rated assets include the European Central Bank, which may lose its appetite for corporate bonds as a result, 
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

=== Title: Michel Barnier Doubles Down on Brexit - Bloomberg ===

European Union Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier dug in and stressed a hardline trade position just as U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s key ministers were starting to unite behind a Brexit policy that may soothe rifts in her Cabinet.
Barnier used an interview with the Guardian newspaper published late Monday to rule out a special carve-out for the U.K. financial services industry and warn that Britain will have to abide by any new rules drawn up by the EU during a transition period after leaving the bloc.
His comments, which underline the EU’s determination not to let the U.K. enjoy the benefits of membership after leaving, came hours after May’s core Brexit team met to discuss what kind of trade deal the U.K. will seek with the bloc when talks start early next year.
The so-called “end state” of the divorce is an issue that divides her ministers, and it’s taken until now for them to start discussing it. The full cabinet will meet Tuesday as May seeks to bring together the differing factions in her top team.
At the meeting on Monday there was support for the idea that the U.K. should make the most of the fact it starts off with all the same rules as the EU, and then selectively move away from some of those regulations, according to a person who was present.
Barnier explicitly ruled out a special deal for Britain’s financial services sector and said the decision to leave the EU single market rules out passporting arrangements which allow British financial services companies to trade in the EU. This will be a blow for banks that are already eyeing alternative cities like Frankfurt to move some of their staff.
“There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn’t exist,” Barnier 
. It is a result of “the red lines that the British have chosen themselves,” he said. “In leaving the single market, they lose the financial services passport.”
U.K. officials, who asked not to be identified, indicated that Barnier’s comments should be seen as a negotiating position ahead of him being given guidelines for trade talks by EU leaders in March. Britain will emphasize the danger to economic cooperation and free trade if the EU pursues such a hard approach, one of the officials said.
Eighteen months after the referendum, May is still seeking a path to Brexit that doesn’t increase divisions in her fractious Conservative Party. Until now she has avoided formal discussions about the end state even in private.
Those who backed Brexit have tended to advocate a clean split and liberation from EU rules, even though that would put up barriers to trade with the bloc. Those who favored remaining in the EU have sought to maintain ties to the country’s biggest trading partner, and are willing to make concessions in return.
It’s not clear what the EU side might think of the proposal to gradually move away from full alignment as and when it suits the U.K. There’s a risk Brussels would consider it the kind of “cherry-picking” approach that it has long rejected. Barnier said at the weekend there’s “no way” negotiators would “mix up the various scenarios to create a specific one and accommodate their wishes.” 
If the EU says no, Cabinet tensions could re-emerge. May has made clear that controlling immigration and getting rid of European Court of Justice influence in the U.K. are red lines for her -- as they are for the most committed Brexit-backers. But the EU has said that access to the single market would require concessions on those points.

=== Title: Retiring Early Just Might Kill You, Says New Research - Bloomberg ===

We already know you’re better off financially the later you begin claiming Social Security. Now it seems there’s another reason to hold off on collecting those checks: If you retire early you’re more likely to die early as well.
A new study from Maria Fitzpatrick at Cornell University and Timothy Moore at the University of Melbourne shows a striking correlation between Social Security claims for early takers and a jump in mortality. This week’s economic research roundup also features a contrarian take on what drives unhealthy nutrition habits among poorer Americans and whether labor-market concentration is holding down wages in the U.S. Check this column each Tuesday for a survey of fresh studies from academia, agencies, think tanks and Wall Street. 
About a third of all Americans retire and start claiming Social Security benefits in their first month of eligibility when they turn 62. Fitzpatrick and Moore find this “may have an immediate, negative impact” on health. The effect is biggest on men in this scenario, who see an increase in mortality risk of about 20 percent.
The authors found no rise in mortality among those for whom 62 was not the eligibility threshold for collecting Social Security. Moreover, demographic groups with the highest rate of retirement at 62 had the highest mortality rate increases at that age. The paper notes that the phenomenon may be linked partly to existing health problems that force some to stop working early.
Mortality rates for Americans as a whole, and especially for children, were down in 2013-2015 from 15 years prior. But death rates went in the opposite direction for rural, working-age people after more than a century of decline, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Abuse of prescription medications, especially opioids, and related heroine-overdose deaths played a large role in the increase.
There is a popular argument that lower availability of healthy food choices in poorer neighborhoods has a meaningful, negative impact on eating habits. These so-called “food deserts” are dominated by grocery and convenience stores where healthy foods are in low supply and carry high prices. The authors of this study, however, reject that notion.
They find that the entrance of supermarkets offering healthy options didn’t materially increase healthy eating habits. The authors instead put more than 90 percent of the blame for nutrition inequality on differences in demand that are “partially explained by education, nutrition knowledge and regional preferences.”
Antitrust regulators tend to focus their scrutiny on how big mergers and acquisitions may affect pricing and consumers. New research shows they may be missing the anti-competitive impact these tie-ups have on the labor market. It may also help the Federal Reserve better understand low wage gains.
The authors used data from CareerBuilder.com to analyze employer concentration in more than 8,000 labor markets categorized by occupation and geography. They found increased concentration of employers is associated with low wages. In fact, moving from the 25 percentile in concentration to the 75th percentile results in a wage decline of 15 percent to 25 percent.

=== Title: Divorce Is Making American Families 66% Bigger - Bloomberg ===

As family structures become more complicated, a new body of new research is attempting to quantify the trend. The proliferation of stepchildren, half-siblings, and other extended relationships has important implications for how American families function.
Almost a third of U.S. households headed by adults under age 55 have at least one stepparent, according to a recent 
 of survey data by
University of Massachusetts Boston Professor Emily Wiemers and others. Similarly, the study found that, looking at couples over age 55 who have adult children, 33 percent have a stepchild.
These step-relationships can stretch both the size and definition of family—researchers included both married and unmarried co-habiting couples in the analysis. For Americans with grown children, counting stepchildren boosts the total number of adult kids by 66 percent, the study found.
The rise in divorce and remarriage is driving this growth in family size. Over the past two decades, the divorce rate has doubled for older Americans. Almost 30 percent of people over 50 had been married more than once, according to a recent 
 by scholars at Bowling Green State University. About 40 percent of older Americans with children are in stepfamilies, according to survey data.
“People in stepfamilies are often unsure of what their obligations are to their stepkin,” said Bowling Green sociology professor Karen Benjamin Guzzo. “It’s not uncommon for individuals to feel like they have to choose how to spread resources across their biological and step-relatives.”
These questions come up when planning vacations, paying for college, and especially as parents and stepparents age. Couples can fight about how much money or time they owe to children from their previous vs. current relationships.
As complex families get older, and baby boomer stepparents move from middle age into their elderly years, even more questions are raised. For example, when your elderly stepparent needs a ride to the doctor’s office, should you feel the same obligation as you would to a biological parent?
Stepkids can end up with more elderly parents to take care of, and aging parents may have more children to lean on for help. In practice, though, stepfamilies can feel less connected to each other. The Weimers study analyzed survey data to compare how often stepfamilies and more traditional families donate time to each other. Couples with adult stepchildren are 11 percentage points less likely to give time to their children, and 13 points less likely to receive time from kids.
“The increased availability of kin does not fully compensate for the weaker bonds among family members in step families,” the paper concludes.
Of course, many stepfamilies are quite close, and many traditional families never get along. But stepfamilies often need to work harder to bring their sprawling families together.

=== Title: Hedge Fund Managers Expect a 39% Bonus Bump - Bloomberg ===

Hedge fund professionals are expecting year-end bonuses to climb 39 percent at the end of this year, according to a survey of 500 buy-side investors. That view may be too optimistic, said a partner at the firm that did the polling.
Respondents on average said they’re looking for bonuses rising to $562,000 from $405,000 a year earlier, recruitment firm Odyssey Search Partners said Monday in a statement. Sector heads, partners and portfolio managers expect a 79 percent rise to $1.38 million.
Hedge funds climbed about 6 percent through the end of November, compared with a 2.8 percent rise for the full year of 2016, according to indexes tracked by Hedge Fund Research. The S&P 500 Index rallied more than 18 percent this year through Nov. 30. The average hedge fund has lagged behind the stock market every year since 2009, prompting institutional investors to slam the industry for fees they say are too high given the performance.
“With assets not substantially increasing and with fees continuing to be under pressure, it may be wishful thinking that the bonus pools would have swelled so considerably,” Anthony Keizner, partner at Odyssey, said in an email.
Private equity professionals are expecting a 14 percent bonus bump in 2017, according to a separate Odyssey survey of 500 personnel. Principals are expecting increases of 8 percent to $355,000, while carried interest is expected to be valued at $3.2 million. That’s the amount the employees are likely to get once profits are shared after the investment period is completed, which is usually five years on average.
“Hedge fund people get their bonus every year,” Keizner said by phone. “On the private equity side, money is held in a five-year fund, and only when those businesses are exited, the people involved will get a percentage of the deals they work on.”

=== Title: Stocks Reach Record Highs as U.S. Tax Vote Looms: Markets Wrap - Bloomberg ===

Stocks kicked off the penultimate week of the year on a positive note after Republicans reached an agreement on the shape of U.S. 
. The dollar dropped and Treasuries headed lower.
The S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index hit new highs Monday as investors focused on the progress of the proposed tax legislation. Midweek votes in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are planned on a measure that will reduce corporate and individual tax rates. Lawmakers are aiming for the bill to land on President Donald Trump’s desk for a signature before Christmas.
“I think that there’s still a fair amount of skepticism in markets until it actually happens,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at money manager Wilmington Trust Corp. in Delaware. “But with passage, we think that there’s still room to run. It’s challenging to say what is priced into the markets, but we do think it will be to the upside.”
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed the most in about five months as real estate, automakers and technology stocks led gains. Sterling advanced as U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May addressed Parliament about

=== Title: A Small Fintech Stock Surged 2,600% in a Week After Announcing It’s a Crypto Company - Bloomberg ===

Fintech plus cryptocurrency equals about $7 billion.
That’s how much the value of LongFin Corp. surged to after the microcap’s stock rocketed by as much as 2,600 percent since debuting Wednesday. Most of the gains came since Friday, when the company issued a 
 saying it bought Ziddu.com, “a blockchain-empowered global micro-lending solutions provider” that transacts only in cryptocurrencies.
LongFin joins a growing list of little-known companies that have seen their values soar after simply announcing plans to join the digital currency craze that’s pushed the value of bitcoin past $300 billion. The microcap rallies are reminiscent of the height of the dot.com bubble, when virtually any company that put tech in its name found favor on the public markets.
For LongFin’s Chief Executive Officer Venkat Meenvalli, the rally may be even sweeter. LongFin bought Ziddu.com from its affiliate Meridian Enterprises Pte. for 2.5 million restricted Class A shares. Meridian Enterprises is 95 percent owned by Meenvalli, LongFin said in a regulatory filing Dec. 11.
It’s not the first time LongFin executives have overseen transactions where they are both the seller and the buyer. Stampede Tradex Pte. Ltd., a subsidiary of Stampede Capital, was sold to Longfin earlier this year.
The stock’s ride on Monday turned comical around 11:15 a.m., when the first of more than a dozen trading halts hit with the gain at almost 100 percent. It lasted the stipulated five minutes before trading resumed, only to stop again three minutes later. It then started an on-for-one, off-for-five-minute cadence that persisted until noon, when trading ceased for 50 minutes. By that time, the surge had reached 548 percent to $142.82. 
The rally is overdone even to LongFin’s Meenvalli.
“It’s crazy, frenzied speculation on the cryptocurrency announcement, which we never expected,” Meenvalli said in a telephone interview Monday. “The fundamentals will slowly show, but this is crazy trading and has nothing to do with the company’s fundamentals.”
When the stock resumed shorty before 1 p.m., the bulge got cut by more than half, to $60. Trading halts resumed, this time for 10 minutes at a time, giving investors scant time to execute trades. The shares closed at $72.38 at 4 p.m., an increase of 229 percent on the day.
Volumes also surged. After an average of 241,000 shares changed hands on the first two days, trading averaged almost 12 million in the past two days. 
LongFin, which offers financing options for small businesses, has 
 going back to 2015, with revenue jumping to $40 million this year from $16 million last year, according to data on its website. The lender reported $7 million of income in the unaudited 2017 results, up from $4 million last year.
With the Ziddu.com acquisition, LongFin aims to base some of its services for importers and exporters on the blockchain. It wants to offer micro loans issued in Ziddu coins backed by goods in borrowers’ warehouses. Ziddu coins can be converted into bitcoin or ether, which can be converted into dollars, and used for working capital needs, according to the press release. The loans would be paid back in cryptocurrencies, and interest will vary from 12 percent to 48 percent, the statement said.
LongFin is one of a growing number of firms that are starting to delve into the cryptocurrency credit market. Some startups are starting to issue loans backed by the borrowers’ cryptocurrency holdings, while others help borrowers get financing from third parties.
It’s too early to tell whether this sector of the cryptocurrency world will catch on and what the consequences will be, but stock investors aren’t waiting to find out.

=== Title: Short Seller Says Naive Bitcoin Traders Open a Pathway to Profit - Bloomberg ===

As newly launched derivatives contracts draw pros into the bitcoin market, a short seller still sees a massive inefficiency -- and a chance to profit off naïve traders.
The Bitcoin Investment Trust, a publicly traded vehicle whose bitcoin holdings are worth $1,601 a share, nonetheless trades at a price more than double that amount, according to 
 compiled by Bloomberg.
A savvy trader could in theory mint money by betting that gap will shrink. Futures contracts introduced over the past week by Cboe Global Markets Inc. and CME Group Inc. provides a way to do that: Buy the futures, short sell the Bitcoin Investment Trust.
That’s precisely what Andrew Left, a short seller at Citron Research, is doing, a fact he reiterated via 
 on Monday morning. “Citron would not be pounding table if not appropriate,” he wrote. “Thank you for the 70 percent profit.”
He then followed that up with comments on Bloomberg Television. “There’s an incredibly naïve investor base behind this who doesn’t want to check the extra boxes off to open a futures account,” he said. The gap between the trust’s price and holdings “has to do with investors out there that do not know what they’re doing.” Left also said that the current challenge for investors interested in shorting the trust is finding shares to borrow.
The futures are already showing signs of efficiency. When they debuted a week ago, Cboe’s traded for a price as much as 13 percent higher than the price of bitcoin -- a wide gap indicating an immature market. But that’s since narrowed to about 1.3 percent. CME’s futures started trading Sunday night and have a similar arbitrage spread.

=== Title: Amtrak Crash Kills at Least Three After Running Off an Overpass - Bloomberg ===

Dupont, Wash. (AP) -- An Amtrak train making the first-ever run along a faster new route hurtled off an overpass south of Seattle on Monday and spilled some of its cars onto the highway below, killing at least three people, injuring dozens and crushing two vehicles, authorities said.
Attention quickly turned to the train's speed. Federal investigators say the train was traveling at 80 mph (129 kph) in a 30 mph (48 kph) zone. Bella Dinh-Zarr, an NTSB board member, said at a Monday night news conference that information from the event data recorder in the rear locomotive provided information about the train's speed.
Dinh-Zarr said it's not yet known what caused the train to derail and that "it's too early to tell" why it was going so fast.
She said federal investigators will likely be on scene for a week or more.
There were 80 passengers and five on-duty crew on board when the train derailed and pulled 13 cars off the tracks. Authorities said there were three confirmed deaths. More than 70 people were taken for medical care — including 10 with serious injuries.
About two hours after the accident, a U.S. official who was briefed on the investigation said he was told at least six people were killed. The official said he had no new information to explain the discrepancy in the numbers.
The official was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
A track chart prepared by the Washington State Department of Transportation shows the maximum speed drops from 79 mph (127 kph) to 30 mph for passenger trains just before the tracks curve to cross Interstate 5, which is where the train went off the tracks.
The chart, dated Feb. 7, 2017, was submitted to the Federal Railroad Administration in anticipation of the start of passenger service along a new bypass route that shaves 10 minutes off the trip between Seattle and Portland.
Kimberly Reason with Sound Transit, the Seattle-area transit agency that owns the tracks, confirmed to the AP that the speed limit at the point where the train derailed is 30 mph (48 kph). Speed signs are posted 2 miles (3 km) before the speed zone changes and just before the speed zone approaching the curve, she said.
Positive train control — the technology that can slow or stop a speeding train — wasn't in use on this stretch of track, according to Amtrak President Richard Anderson.
He spoke on a conference call with reporters, said he was "deeply saddened by all that has happened today."
Bob Chipkevich, a former NTSB director of railroad, pipeline and hazardous materials investigations, told The Seattle Times the crash looked like a high-speed derailment based on television images.
In a radio transmission immediately after the accident, the conductor can be heard saying the train was coming around a corner and was crossing a bridge that passed over Interstate 5 when it derailed. Dispatch audio also indicated that the engineer survived with bleeding from the head and both eyes swollen shut.
"I'm still figuring that out. We've got cars everywhere and down onto the highway," he tells the dispatcher, who asks if everyone is OK.
Aleksander Kristiansen, a 24-year-old exchange student at the University of Washington from Copenhagen, was going to Portland to visit the city for the day.
"I was just coming out of the bathroom when the accident happened. My car just started shaking really, really badly," he said.
The back of his train car was wide open because it had separated from the rest of the train, so he and others were able to jump out to safety. He was at about the middle of the train, either the sixth or seventh car, he said, and was "one of the lucky ones."
Emma Shafer was headed home to Vancouver, Washington, on winter break from the Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle and was napping when the crash occurred.
She awoke to find her body at a 45-degree angle and her train car dangling from the overpass. Someone behind her was pinned by the legs, she said, and she and others who could walk exited the train by crawling onto a car underneath theirs that had been crushed.
"It felt oddly silent after the actual crashing. There was a lot of metal, a lot of screeching, a lot of being thrown around. It was very quiet. Then there was people screaming," Shafer said.
"I don't know if I actually heard the sirens, but they were there. A guy was like, 'Hey, I'm Robert. We'll get you out of here.'"
Dr. Nathan Selden, a neurosurgeon at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, said he and his son drove through the accident scene while traveling north to visit Seattle. The doctor asked if he could help and was ushered to a medical triage tent in the highway median.
The most seriously injured had already been whisked away, but the patients he helped appeared to have open head wounds and skull, pelvic or leg fractures, as well as small cuts and neck sprains, he said.
He called it a miracle an infant child he saw from the scene appeared completely unharmed.
President Donald Trump used the deadly derailment to call for more infrastructure spending in a tweet sent about three hours after the accident. He said the wreck shows "more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly." The accident happened on a newly completed bypass.
The train was making the inaugural run on the new route as part of a $180.7 million project designed to speed up service by removing passenger trains from a route along Puget Sound that's bogged down by curves, single-track tunnels and freight traffic.
The Amtrak Cascades service that runs from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Eugene, Oregon, is jointly owned by the Washington and Oregon transportation departments. Amtrak operates the service for the two states as a contractor and is responsible for day-to-day operations.
The Amtrak schedule called for the train to leave Seattle around 6 a.m. and arrive in Portland about 3 1/2 hours later.
The new bypass was built on an existing inland rail line that runs along Interstate 5 from Tacoma to DuPont, near where Train 501 derailed. Track testing began in January and February in advance of Monday's launch and continued through at least July, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation.
The mayor of Lakewood, Washington, a city along the new route, predicted a deadly crash — but one involving a fast-moving train hitting a car or pedestrian at a grade-crossing, not a train tumbling off an overpass.
Eric Corp, a councilman for the small city of DuPont near the derailment, said he rode the train with about 30 or so dignitaries and others on a special trip Friday before the service opened to the public Monday.
"Once we were coming up on that curve, the train slowed down considerably," he said, adding that "in no way did it make me feel like we were going too fast."

=== Title: Grassley Says He Wants McCabe Replaced as Deputy FBI Director - Bloomberg ===

The Senate Judiciary chairman said Monday he wants Andrew McCabe removed as deputy director of the FBI, a day before he is scheduled to testify behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee in its Russia investigation.
"He oughta be replaced. And I’ve said that before and I’ve said it to people who can do it," panel Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, told reporters.
Grassley has questioned whether McCabe has a conflict of interest and is biased against President Donald Trump. McCabe’s wife in 2015 ran for a state Senate seat in Virginia, backed in part with money from associates of Hillary Clinton, Trump’s opponent in last year’s presidential election.
Such concerns with McCabe have increased among Republicans with the recent release of text messages that many Republicans claimed showed anti-Trump bias by agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team investigating whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russians to help get him elected.
The president has complained on 
 that his Attorney General Jeff Sessions should have fired McCabe a long time ago.
Grassley said the president shouldn’t intervene to have McCabe removed and instead leave that up to Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray.
"Trump ought to stay out of it," Grassley said. "I think it’s a Christopher Wray job."
FBI spokesman Andrew Ames declined to comment.
House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, said in an appearance on Fox News last week he’d be "a little surprised" if McCabe still had his job this week.
McCabe’s closed-door interview had been arranged after months of efforts by committee Republicans who had been angered over what they said was an inability to get more cooperation from the FBI in turning over material about the investigation. House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes of California has suggested preparing contempt of Congress action against the FBI and the Justice Department.
Republicans, who have long wanted to question McCabe over how the FBI used a now-famous dossier about Trump with unverified accusations of collusion, also want to ask about the Strzok text messages.
Grassley and other Republicans have said they want to know what McCabe knows about a particular text message from Strzok in August 2016 -- during the presidential campaign -- talking about a need for some "insurance policy" in the case of a Trump victory. They also want to know what McCabe knows about demoted Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr, who was reportedly contracted to help prepare opposition research on Trump.

=== Title: U.S. Stocks Drop as Investors Await Tax-Cut Vote: Markets Wrap - Bloomberg ===

U.S. equity markets fell as investors waited for lawmakers to vote on tax cuts in the world’s largest economy. Treasuries declined while the dollar rose.
The S&P 500 Index dropped Tuesday after rising prospects for the tax plan had sparked a two-day rally of almost 1.5 percent that took the benchmark within a whisker of 2,700 for the first time. The biggest focus for those still chasing gains is the 
 of the U.S. tax overhaul. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the tax bill following a floor debate in the morning. The action then turns to the Senate, where Republican leaders intend to bring the bill up as soon as they get it.
“It will help sustain a very strong year of earnings growth for U.S. and for global equities,” said Timothy Graf, State Street Bank & Trust head of macro strategy EMEA., speaking on Bloomberg TV. “It will keep sentiment robust.”
The Stoxx Europe 600 fluctuated as gains for airline shares and real estate companies offset a drop in resource stocks. The region’s core bonds declined, with German yields seeing their biggest climb in more than a month. 
Sterling declined as Brexit efforts rumbled on. South Africa’s rand retreated after reaching its strongest level since March after 
 won the ruling African National Congress party’s leadership contest. The Mexican peso also dropped. 
Oil traded above $57 a barrel before U.S. data forecast to show crude stockpiles in the world’s biggest consumer fell for a fifth week. Gold fell and copper rose.
It was a mixed picture for equities in Asia, with benchmarks in Japan and South Korea falling earlier as stocks in Sydney, Hong Kong and China climbed.

=== Title: IMF Warns One of Most Crowded Bond Trades Near Tipping Point - Bloomberg ===

It’s one of the most crowded trades for good reason. But dizzying returns and a surge of inflows have put emerging markets on a narrow precipice.
After several false starts, economists are 
 next year will finally be the one in which borrowing costs get a significant leg-up. The International Monetary Fund is warning it could mark the tipping point for emerging-market bond funds sitting on the biggest annual inflows since the financial crisis.
“It’s an increasingly uncomfortable equilibrium,” Societe Generale SA strategists including Jason Daw said in a December report. “Eventually, there will be a 
 that will impair parts of the EM complex.”
Investors piled into emerging-market bond funds this year as central banks delayed curbing monetary stimulus that’s pumped liquidity to developing economies over the past decade. A pickup in global growth that pulled Russia, Argentina and Brazil out of recession also helped to buoy sentiment, driving returns of 19 percent since the end of 2015 versus 12 percent in the period for a global credit index.
Monetary policy normalization will reduce inflows to emerging-market funds by $70 billion over the next two years, according to IMF 
 in a report by economist Robin Koepke last week. The guardian of financial stability warned diminished access to foreign capital could also make it more challenging for economies in the developing world to finance deficits and roll over debt.
Just over half, or $1.2 trillion, of the total external debt stock owed by emerging-market issuers comes due through 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence 
.
But even if they have to refinance at higher rates, companies in the developing world shouldn’t become less able to service their debt given rebounding corporate revenues, said Sacha Tihanyi, senior emerging-market strategist at TD Securities LLC in New York. 
“So long as higher funding costs come from economic growth and a Fed hiking rates for positive reasons, there’ll likely be an offset,” Tihanyi said. “I wouldn’t be overly concerned in general about emerging-market corporates having trouble refinancing or servicing hard-currency debts.”
Stress tests conducted by economists at the Federal Reserve for a June 
 found that emerging-market companies are less reliant on hard-currency borrowing than in previous financial crises, and the risk posed by currency mismatches is less acute.
Still, emerging markets ranked in the top 5 most-crowded global trades based on long positions in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund survey published on Dec. 19. A gradual pace of monetary normalization is “crucial” to ensuring emerging markets’ ability to adjust to reduced inflows, according to the IMF’s Koepke. 
Borrowing costs across advanced economies are 
 to at least 1 percent next year in what would be the largest increase since 2006, while the European Central Bank curtails bond buying and the Fed downsizes its balance sheet.
“Even limited withdrawals of foreign capital could result in significant stress on emerging market borrowers if they were to occur over a relatively short period,” Koepke said.

=== Title: Trump, Real Estate Investors Get Late-Added Perk in Tax Bill - Bloomberg ===

Lawmakers scrambling to lock up Republican support for the tax reform bill added a complicated provision late in the process -- one that would provide a multimillion-dollar windfall to real estate investors such as President 
.
The change, which would allow real estate businesses to take advantage of a new tax break that’s planned for partnerships, limited liability companies and other so-called “pass-through” businesses, combined elements of House and Senate legislation in a new way. Its beneficiaries are clear, tax experts say, and they include a president who’s said that the tax legislation wouldn’t help him financially.
“This last-minute provision will significantly benefit the ultra-wealthy real estate investor, including the president and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, resulting in a timely tax-reduction gift for the holidays,” said Harvey Bezozi, a certified public accountant and the founder of YourFinancialWizard.com. “Ordinary people who invest in rental real estate will also benefit.”
James Repetti, a tax law professor at Boston College Law School, said: “This is a windfall for real estate developers like Trump.”
The revision might also bring tax benefits to several members of Congress, according to financial disclosures they’ve filed that reflect ownership of pass-through firms with real estate holdings. One such lawmaker, Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who’d voted against an earlier version of the legislation, said on Friday that he would support the revised legislation.
Corker said in an interview on Saturday that his change of heart had nothing to do with the added benefit for real estate investors. On Sunday he 
 to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch seeking an explanation for how the provision came to be included in the final bill after being asked about it by a reporter.
“The suggestion was that it was airdropped into the conference without prior consideration by either the House or the Senate,” Corker said, 
 that he’d been informed over the weekend that a similar provision had been in the House version.
Hatch responded in a letter to Corker Monday that the change resulted after “the House secured a version of their proposal that was consistent with the overall structure of the compromise.” He also said any assertion that Corker had sought the change -- or that it was included to benefit real estate developers -- was “categorically false.”
Hatch also said he was “disgusted by press reports” that he said had distorted the provision. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn called initial press reports about the change  “completely false and invented” and criticized follow-up coverage.
“The way this phony news story broke and was picked up on social media and in the mainstream media would make a Russian intelligence officer proud,” Cornyn said.
Last month, during a speech in St. Charles, Missouri, Trump took pains to tell his audience that the tax-overhaul bill would hurt him personally. “This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing,” he said. “Believe me.”
On Sunday, White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters didn’t directly address questions about how the added provision would affect Trump or his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, whose family business also has extensive real estate holdings.
“The president’s goal in tax reform was to create a bill that gives middle-income families a big tax cut and stimulates economic growth so they can continue to feel that relief for years to come,” Walters said in an emailed statement.
It’s impossible to gauge precise effects on Trump, who has departed from roughly 40 years of tradition for presidential candidates by refusing to release his tax returns, saying they’re under audit. Nonetheless, his financial disclosures show he’s used an array of pass-through businesses, including in his real estate ventures.
Many of Trump’s most lucrative businesses generate income from rents and leases. Trump Tower in Manhattan, with offices and retail stores as well as condominiums, generated $14.1 million of net operating income on $33.6 million of revenue in 2016, according to financials disclosed to Trump’s lenders at the property. Another office tower, 40 Wall Street in New York’s financial district, had $17.4 million of net operating income on $36.9 million of revenue that year, similar filings for that building show. 
Trump’s building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas had $77.7 million of net operating income on $137.9 million of revenue in 2016, the lender filings show. Trump owns 30 percent of it. He has a similar arrangement with the building’s majority owner, Vornado Realty Trust, for an office complex in San Francisco.
Kushner’s family owns 
, which could also benefit from the revision. Through various LLCs and partnerships, the family collects tens of millions in rent from apartment complexes and office properties in New York, New Jersey and Maryland.
The last-minute change to the tax bill -- which combined a capital-investment approach that the House favored with the Senate’s tax-cut mechanism -- would, in effect, free up a 20 percent deduction on pass-through business income that would have been off-limits to many real estate firms under the Senate bill. The change would still leave some investment partnerships out: those that have few employees and invest in tangible property like land or artwork, said Michael Kosnitzky, a tax partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP.
The distinction centers on whether tangible property held by a business is “depreciable” -- meaning it can be reflected as declining in value over time under accounting rules -- even though it may rise in market value. Depreciable property includes apartment buildings, housing complexes, office towers and shopping centers.
Deciding how to tax pass-through entities, which form the backbone of American business, has been one of the most contentious debates among Republican tax writers in their rush to rewrite the tax code and notch a major policy win by the end of this year. Such businesses, which also include sole proprietorships and “S corporations,” don’t pay taxes themselves, but pass their income to their owners, who then pay tax at their individual rates.
Because their tax bill would slash the tax rate for “C corporations” -- a business type that includes major, publicly traded companies like Exxon Mobil and General Electric Co. -- to 21 percent from 35 percent, the Republican tax writers have been under pressure to deliver comparable tax relief to pass-through businesses.
The bill seeks to do that by setting up a 20 percent deduction on pass-through business income -- and making it available to both local pizza shop owners and major, nationwide businesses, all while setting up guardrails to prevent owners from mischaracterizing high-taxed wage income as lower-taxed business income.
The deduction is broadly available to owners of pass-through entities up to an income threshold of $207,500 for singles and $415,000 for couples. After that, limits begin to kick in that would prevent various kinds of “service” providers -- including doctors, lawyers, investment advisers and brokers, and professional athletes -- from receiving its benefit at higher income amounts.
The Senate approved legislation on Dec. 2 that included a way for owners of large firms with lots of employees to avoid certain income limitations on the deduction: They’d be allowed to deduct half of their share of the W-2 employee wages their companies paid out annually.
That approach would have left out real estate firms, which typically have relatively few employees but large capital investments. For them, the compromise bill offers an additional method: deduct 25 percent of wages paid, plus 2.5 percent of the purchase price -- or “unadjusted basis” of their tangible, depreciable property.
But no matter the method, owners would be limited to no more than an overall 20 percent deduction.
Offering the 20 percent deduction to businesses that don’t tend to employ many people is “in a sense contrary to the Administration’s job creation policy initiatives,” said Pillsbury Winthrop’s Kosnitzky.
But “many capital-intensive industries are indirect job creators -- putting contractors, subcontractors, tradesmen and other to work,” said Ryan McCormick, senior vice president and counsel at the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group.
Details of how lawmakers decided on their final approach are sketchy. On Sunday, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn suggested the change was made as part of a process to “cobble together the votes we needed to get this bill passed.”
“We were working very hard,” he said during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week.” “It was a very intense process.”
The International Business Times, which first reported on the revision’s potential effects on various elected officials, noted that it could benefit several members of Congress who have real estate investments via pass-through businesses. That includes Corker, who was the only Republican senator to vote “no” on earlier Senate legislation. The Senate approved that measure nonetheless on a 51-49 vote, which set the stage for reaching last week’s final compromise with House leaders.
Corker said Friday that he would vote “yes” on the new version -- a reversal that could be meaningful for the bill’s chances. Republicans hold a slim, 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate, and Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, who’s being treated for brain cancer, is 
 to vote this week. Corker’s switch gave GOP leaders an extra measure of certainty.
Corker told Bloomberg News Saturday that he wasn’t aware of the new benefit for real estate investors when he decided on Thursday to back the final bill based on a two-page summary he’d seen. The bill text was released Friday.
“I have no earthly idea of how that provision -- or, candidly, any other provision -- made it in,” Corker said. He also said he didn’t know how the change would affect him financially, adding that “there’s just no way a provision like that would affect me on a big decision like this.”
Corker filed a financial disclosure earlier this year showing that among other interests, he had ownership in Corker Properties X LP, a partnership that owns a building in Chattanooga, Tennessee, according to local property records. Corker listed income from the property between $1 million and $5 million in 2016. Still, it’s not clear how much benefit he might receive from the bill.
Corker cited concerns about the deficit for his previous opposition, and tax writers have done nothing to alleviate the deficit impact. The Congressional Budget Office estimated late Friday that the revised measure would increase federal deficits by $1.455 trillion over 10 years, a projection that’s slightly higher than for the version Corker opposed previously.
The senator acknowledged that his deficit argument was unsuccessful, but said he had concluded that the bill’s overall effect would stimulate economic growth for both corporations and small businesses.
“All of that seems worth the risk,” Corker said.

=== Title: Saudis Down Yemen Rebel Missile Before It Strikes Palace - Bloomberg ===

Saudi Arabia said its air defenses intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Yemen rebels at the royal palace in the capital, Riyadh, an attack that threatens to edge the kingdom and its chief nemesis, Iran, closer to confrontation.
The Iranian-backed Houthi militants said they targeted a meeting of top Saudi officials at the al-Yamamah palace, the official residence of King Salman and headquarters of the royal court. Saudi Arabia is leading a military campaign against the Houthis in Yemen, and shortly after the missile launch, alliance aircraft struck Houthi positions south of the Yemeni capital, Sana’a.
“You are hitting Sana’a and we are hitting Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” rebel leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi said in a speech. “You are attacking the republican palace in Sana’a and our ballistic missiles reach al-Yamamah palace in Riyadh. You are targeting our vital installations and we will do that.” A separate Houthi statement said Saudi military and oil installations were also “within our missiles’ reach.”
The missile attack, aimed at the very heart of Saudi power, is the most audacious challenge to Saudi Arabia by Iran’s proxy in Yemen. Saudi Arabia and Iran already support opposing sides in conflicts across the Middle East, and after the rebels fired a missile at the international airport in Riyadh last month, the coalition warned that the failed attack could be considered “an act of war” against Saudi Arabia.
Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki on Tuesday again pointed the finger at Iran. “This aggressive and arbitrary act by the armed Houthi Iranian group proves the continued involvement of the Iranian regime in supporting the Houthis with qualitative capabilities,” he said, according to state-run Saudi Press Agency. The Saudi royal air defense forces spotted the launch of the missile from Yemen, he added.
The United Arab Emirates’ state minister for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said on Twitter on Tuesday that “with every Iranian missile launched by the Houthi militia against civilian targets, it becomes clear that the storm is necessary.”
Crispin Hawes, a managing director at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consulting firm in London, predicted “a concerted effort by the Saudi government to push for action against Iran.”
“We have clearly entered a period where there is a direct threat to Saudi population centers, even with their air defense systems in place,” Hawes said. This will have a “depressing impact on the local capital markets and on economic activity in general,” he added.
A loud boom was heard in Riyadh and a column of white smoke could be seen briefly from a distance before the coalition announced it had intercepted the missile. No injuries were reported, according to Sky News Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index declined as much as 0.4 percent before recovering the loss.
The palace that was targeted on Tuesday is the site of official meetings, including cabinet sessions, last held there on Dec. 12. The cabinet met on Tuesday to approve the 2018 budget, which officials said would focus on bolstering an economy battered by the drop in oil prices, austerity measures and regional instability.
Yemen’s civil war, nearing the end of its third year, has become part of the broader struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran for regional influence. The coalition is fighting the rebels, who are members of the Zaidi branch of Shiite Islam, to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, a Sunni.
The fighting has killed well over 5,000 civilians and contributed to one of the world’s biggest humanitarian disasters, according to the United Nations. Nearly 1 million people have contracted cholera, and 3 million, out of a population of 28 million, are internally displaced, according to the UN.
Saudi Arabia last week hosted 
 between the head of Yemen’s Islah Party, which is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, the crown prince of the U.A.E.’s capital, Abu Dhabi, which classifies the Islamist group as terrorists. Gargash said the talks -- held after the Houthis assassinated their onetime battlefield ally, former Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh -- aimed to “unite efforts to defeat Iran and its Houthi militias.”
Dozens of civilians have died this month in an intensified coalition campaign following Saleh’s assassination, which took place after the Houthis accused him of defecting to the Saudi side. 
The attack Tuesday could be “a reminder that the Houthis are still there and can keep the Saudis on their toes,” said David Butter, associate fellow at Chatham House in London.

=== Title: Homicide Police Probe Deaths of Canadian Billionaire and Wife - Bloomberg ===

The Toronto police homicide unit has taken over the investigation in the deaths of billionaire executive Bernard “Barry” Sherman and his wife, who were found dead in their Toronto home Friday to the shock of business and political leaders across Canada.
The post-mortem examination found that both deaths were caused by “ligature neck compression,” signaling a type of strangulation. Toronto’s homicide unit won’t be doing press updates anytime soon as they’re focused on determining whether one or both deaths were in fact homicides, Toronto police constable Caroline de Kloet said in a phone interview Monday.
The bodies of the 75-year-old founder of 
 and his wife, Honey Sherman, 70, were 
 in the Toronto neighborhood of North York under what police called “suspicious” circumstances. Police have said they aren’t looking for any suspects in the case, and media reports over the weekend indicated there was no sign of forced entry into the home.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other major political figures praised the couple’s legacy as news of their deaths spread Friday. “Our condolences to their family & friends, and to everyone touched by their vision & spirit,” Trudeau wrote on Twitter.
The Shermans’ family lashed out at police and media following several reports on the weekend speculating on the cause of the death for the couple, who were known for their philanthropic support for Toronto area hospitals and universities, among other causes.
“Our parents shared an enthusiasm for life and commitment to their family and community totally inconsistent with the rumors regrettably circulated in the media as to the circumstances surrounding their deaths,” according to the 
. “We urge the Toronto Police Service to conduct a thorough, intensive and objective criminal investigation.”
Apotex, in its own 
 on Saturday, hailed Sherman’s role in leading the company to become one of the world’s largest generic-drug makers, employing some 11,000 people including more than 6,000 in Canada. “Patients around the world live healthier and more fulfilled lives thanks to his life’s work,” the statement read.
Sherman, who had a Ph.D. in astrophysics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was chairman of the closely held Toronto-based generic-drug maker and was ranked recently by Forbes as Canada’s 12th-richest person with a net worth of about $3 billion.
The billionaire held a fundraiser for Trudeau in August 2015, shortly before his Liberals won the election, an event that was later reportedly investigated by the country’s lobbying watchdog. The Shermans’ 12,440-square-foot home had recently been placed on the market for almost C$7 million ($5.4 million).
Linda Frum, a Canadian senator who recently awarded a medal to Honey Sherman for community service, was among those paying tribute to someone she described as one of the most beloved members of Canada’s Jewish community.
“I am gutted by the loss of Honey and Barry Sherman. Our community is steeped in grief. I am heartbroken,” she said on Twitter.

=== Title: Deadly Rail Crash Revives Questions About Amtrak’s Safety Record - Bloomberg ===

The deadly Amtrak crash in Washington state marked the railroad’s third fatal accident in as many years, putting the passenger rail operator under fresh scrutiny less than a month after safety regulators issued a scathing report.
Bound for Portland, Oregon, Amtrak train 501 was traveling 50 miles per hour over the posted speed limit when it derailed Monday morning south of Seattle. Several rail cars plunged off an overpass, hitting vehicles below on the busy Interstate 5. At least three people died, 13 cars jumped the track and Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency.
It was the first day that Amtrak trains were running on the Point Defiance Bypass Project, an inland route formerly owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s BNSF Railway that had been upgraded by the state for higher-speed Amtrak passenger-rail service.
"This is a brand new stretch of track, the question will be, ‘Was it designed correctly?’" said Fred Millar, an independent rail-safety consultant. "People were pretty dismayed this train could crash over the wall and into the highway."
The 
 last month decried the safety culture of Amtrak in its report into an April 2016 derailment in Chester, Pennsylvania, that killed two track workers and injured another 39 people. In a 
 Nov. 14, the NTSB cited a "deficient safety management across many levels of Amtrak."
“Amtrak’s safety culture is failing, and is primed to fail again, until and unless Amtrak changes the way it practices safety management,” NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said in a statement then.
The Chester accident was one of two major Amtrak derailments in 2016. The year before, a crash in Philadelphia killed eight and injured more than 200. It was blamed on a distracted engineer. The train was 
 through a curved stretch of track before it derailed.
"When the NTSB gives us a recommendation, we implement their recommendations," Amtrak President Richard Anderson said on a call with reporters after Monday’s accident. "I assure you that we take those very seriously and continue to make the investments recommended by the NTSB."
The train that crashed Monday was traveling at 80 miles per hour in an area in which the speed limit is 30 mph, NTSB Member Bella Dinh-Zarr said at a news conference.
President Donald Trump said Monday on Twitter that the derailment shows "more than ever" why the White House’s coming infrastructure plan needs swift approval, saying, "Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!"
Trump’s fiscal 2018 budget proposal, however, called for slashing Amtrak’s funding by $630 million and ending long-distance routes, citing poor on-time performance and the costs of those routes. Amtrak, which carries more than 30 million passengers a year, reported an operating loss of $227 million in fiscal 2016, on revenues of $3.2 billion.
Monday’s crash occurred on tracks owned by Sound Transit, a public-transit agency serving the Seattle metro area and the state of Washington. The states of Oregon and Washington own the Amtrak Cascades service, which runs from Eugene, Oregon, to Vancouver, Canada. Amtrak operates it as a contractor.
The overlapping ownership and operations complicates the investigation, said Deborah Hersman, chief executive officer of the National Safety Council, a private safety advocacy group.
"If it happens on the Northeast corridor on an Amtrak route with Amtrak equipment and Amtrak operating, certainly they’re going to be wholly responsible," Hersman said. "We have to understand the full picture and it’s still to early to tell what the cause is and really assign that to anyone."
In a low-speed crash, train cars generally still stay in line. In this case, the cars were scattered all over, former NTSB chair Mary Schiavo said in an interview on CNN.
"It looks to me like it was a high-speed event on a curve,” because the train cars were "thrown like leaves in the wind," Schiavo said.
The investigation may review why an automated train-safety system long recommended by the NTSB wasn’t installed on the section of rail. 
Positive Train Control is a system that monitors other trains to prevent collisions and also ensures that a train doesn’t speed.
The NTSB has for years pushed federal and local railroad regulators to install the train-control system to prevent accidents. It would have slowed an Amtrak train that derailed in Philadelphia in 2015, the safety board concluded. 
Congress mandated the installation of the system, but pushed back the deadline to 2018 after railroads said they couldn’t meet an earlier requirement. Amtrak’s Anderson said it wasn’t active on the tracks where Monday’s accident occurred.
“This is an incredible disappointment when it comes to safety,” Deborah Hersman, former NTSB chairwoman and current president of the National Safety Council, said in an interview on CNN Tuesday. “We have got to get this technology on trains to prevent this from occurring again and again.”
The NTSB dispatched an investigative team to the scene, which occurred on the debut run of a route intended to ease congestion on tracks Amtrak shares with nearly 50 freight trains daily. The launch of public service began "after weeks of inspection and testing," according to the Washington State Department of Transportation.
Rail accidents killed 775 people in the U.S. last year, up from 748 in 2015, according to figures from the 
Nearly 700 died in railway accidents from January through September of this year, according to the agency. The figures include deaths involving passenger, freight and commuter rails, as well as those struck by trains.
Trump has promised to seek $1 trillion in U.S. infrastructure investment, and the White House plans to release a detailed document of principles in January for Congress to draft legislation, an administration official has said.
But the principles aren’t expected to target Amtrak or passenger rail specifically. Rather, the plan calls for allocating at least $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years from unspecified budget cuts to spur at least $800 billion in spending by states, localities and the private sector.
The bulk of the federal money would go to a pool of cash for which states and localities could apply, with preference given to those that raise taxes or find other dedicated revenue for projects, the official has said. The idea is to encourage self-help and avoid supplanting non-federal funding.
Democrats and infrastructure advocates have already complained that $200 billion is insufficient, that states and localities are already doing their fair share, and the federal government needs to be a better partner.
Senate Democrats have proposed $1 trillion in federal investment, including $50 billion to “modernize America’s rail infrastructure.” The proposal doesn’t identify a funding source.
Funding is tricky because Democrats want more federal money and Republicans don’t want deficit spending, said Republican Representative Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
“We have to find a path forward that satisfies both the Democrats and Republicans,” Shuster said. “But I believe there is a path forward.”

=== Title: Bitcoin Takes Bigger Wall Street Stage With Smooth CME Debut - Bloomberg ===

The world’s biggest exchange just joined the bitcoin revolution.
Bitcoin futures started trading Sunday night at CME Group Inc.’s venue, a week after Chicago rival Cboe Global Markets Inc. 
 similar derivatives on the volatile cryptocurrency. CME is a much bigger player in futures, so many traders expected it to make a bigger splash in the nascent space.
CME got off to a faster start with more efficient pricing. Its most-active contract changed hands 221 times in the first hour versus 570 during Cboe’s debut. But that’s a win because CME’s contracts are five times more valuable -- they’re tied to five bitcoins compared with only one with Cboe’s futures.
“People were better prepared” for the start of trading at CME, said Bobby Cho, head of trading at Cumberland, the cryptocurrency trading unit of DRW Holdings LLC. “They knew how they were going to hedge their positions.”
CME’s futures traded at about 2 percent above bitcoin itself as of 11:56 a.m. in London; in the first day, Cboe’s got as much as 13 percent above, a sign trading was relatively inefficient. Bitcoin today climbed 9 percent from its Friday New York close to $19,190, approaching the record $19,511 reached hours earlier.
The CME and Cboe bitcoin futures have some distinct features. The price of Cboe’s product is derived from the cryptocurrency’s price at a single exchange; CME’s is based off four.
“We were waiting for the launch of the CME futures because the price is more robust and the exchange trades much larger volumes,” Jose Miguel Nascimento, head trader at cryptocurrency fund Solidus Capital, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. “Futures are a very positive development for the bitcoin market, as it will help everyone from miners to traders hedge risk, and having a price curve will help limit price swings.”
The CME futures are another step into the mainstream financial world for an asset created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as an alternative to banks and government-issued currencies. The contracts, which settle in dollars and trade on regulated exchanges, can be bought by institutional investors that are prohibited from buying bitcoin directly on largely unregulated exchanges.
“One of the biggest issues when it comes to investing institutionally in digital assets is banks and larger institutions can’t hold an unregulated instrument in their balance sheet, and a futures contract is something they can hold,” said Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital-asset strategy at VanEck Associates Corp. With futures, “you don’t hold the physical bitcoin, which solves custody issues and counterparty risks with these less-regulated exchanges.”
To protect against wild, mistaken price swings, CME will briefly pause trading if the contracts rise or fall 7 percent or 13 percent, and prices won’t be allowed to move more than 20 percent. That wasn’t necessary in its debut. Cboe also has volatility halts, which were triggered in the initial hours of trading a week ago, and its January contract rose as much as 26 percent on the first day.
Cboe’s website stalled during its launch. CME’s seemed to weather the traffic.
“It’s only one-lots,” said Garrett See, chief executive officer of crypto trading firm DV Chain of the initial CME trades. “The prices are moving around pretty fast.” The order book was pretty thin and “the orders that are there are very small.”
Futures open up arbitrage opportunities -- the chance to bet prices of the derivatives and the underlying cryptocurrency will converge. Last week, Cboe’s product was priced as much as 13 percent higher than bitcoin, but that quickly narrowed. By Sunday night, it was similar to CME’s.
Some brokerages didn’t immediately give customers access to bitcoin futures. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. 
 that it will offer Cboe’s starting on Monday, though it’ll wait to offer the CME contracts until they demonstrate sufficient liquidity. E*Trade Financial Corp. is considering offering bitcoin futures, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.
“We look at the volume, the open interest and the spreads, and we want to make sure that all those conditions are maturing properly,” said JB Mackenzie, managing director for futures trading at TD Ameritrade. “We have had a lot of customer interest, and we have spent a lot of time educating them as to the differences between the two products.”
Banks and brokers who are offering access are being cautious. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. demanded some clients set aside collateral equal to 100 percent of the value of their trades, people familiar with the investments 
. The guidelines are inclusive of other margin requirements such as Options Clearing Corp.’s 44 percent, required to clear contracts traded at Cboe, and the 47 percent CME is demanding.
It’s not uncommon for a brokerage to impose steeper requirements than the exchange. Interactive Brokers Group Inc., which has said it handled 53 percent of the first day’s trading in Cboe’s bitcoin futures, will require a margin of 50 percent for long investments, and about 240 percent for short selling, based on current rates, according to Interactive Brokers spokeswoman Kalen Holliday.

=== Title: Six Ways to Make the New Tax Bill Work for You - Bloomberg ===

At the end of every year, millions of Americans can make strategic moves to shave a few bucks off their April tax bill. Right now, millions more should be able to get into the act, with Congressional Republicans poised to pass a 503-page law that fundamentally restructures the U.S. tax code.
If the bill passes, new tax rates and countless other provisions would go into effect on Jan. 1. Most of the old rules though would still apply in the last two weeks of 2017—and that gives individuals a shrinking window of time to employ strategies that would lower their taxes for next year’s tax season. (While the legislation would take effect in the new year, it won’t be reflected in your tax forms until the 2019 tax season).
So, here are suggestions from accountants, financial planners, and other tax experts on how to make the most of this opportunity. Keep in mind that the best advice depends specifically on how you’re going to be affected by the tax bill. While most Americans would get a tax cut in the short term, some taxpayers could see higher tax bills in 2018. “No individual is average,” Suzanne Shier, a tax strategist at Northern Trust Corp., reminds us. “An average is a composite of multiple individuals.”
If your taxes are set to spike in 2018, many of these strategies won’t work as well. But if you’re part of the majority who will see an initial tax benefit from the law, there could be big benefits for acting soon.
A typical piece of end-of-the-year advice is to increase your potential deductions before Jan. 1. Deductions claimed for things you did this year will lower tax bills due the following April. Wait until January, and you’ll need to cool your heels for more than a year to get the benefit of deductions claimed.
This year, beefing up your charitable giving could be even more effective. If your tax rate is falling in 2018, your deductions are more valuable if claimed against this year’s income. Giving to charity, a tax deduction that’s preserved under the tax bill, is an effective way to boost your 2017 deductions on short notice.
And even if your tax rate is going up next year under the new bill, you may still want to make a bunch of charitable donations in 2017. Most deductions, including the charitable one, can only be claimed if you itemize your tax return. The bill would sharply limit the number of taxpayers who would benefit from itemizing: First it raises the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for single people, and $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. Second, it limits other deductions—most famously for state and local taxes—so it’s harder for taxpayers to reach the threshold where itemizing makes sense.
So, you might want to think about making several years of charitable donations this month if you can afford it, said Philip “Rusty” Ross, a financial adviser at Exencial Wealth Advisors based in Oklahoma City. If you’re not sure where to donate, you can open a donor-advised fund and decide later where your money will go. But move fast—there are only two weeks left in December.
Another traditional recommendation for this time of year is to defer income. While salaried workers generally can’t choose when they get paid, business owners can often delay registering income until the following year, lowering their April tax bill in the process. Investors can also control their taxable income—and thus lower capital gains tax bills—by selling losing stocks or waiting to sell winning stocks until 2018. In most years, deferring income merely delays the taxes you will have to pay eventually. But, if you expect your tax rate to fall next year, deferring income into 2018 could actually save you money. (There’s also some good news for equity investors 
.)
As we noted, the tax bill would limit how much state and local taxes (or SALT) individuals can deduct, to no more than $10,000 of a combination of property taxes and either income or sales taxes. The move by the Republican-controlled Congress was criticized by Democrats as an effort to make citizens of high-tax blue states pay for benefits to corporations and citizens of low-tax red states. As a result, advisers had been planning to instruct clients targeted by this provision to find ways to maximize their SALT deduction in 2017, by pre-paying next year’s taxes as much as allowed and deducting them under the old rules. But the final compromise bill, unveiled Friday by Republicans in the Senate and House, explicitly closes this loophole with respect to income taxes. Any 2018 state and local income taxes paid ahead of time would nevertheless need to be counted on next year’s taxes, according to the bill. However, taxpayers could still pre-pay property taxes due in 2018, and deduct them under the old rules. Additionally, any taxes due for 2017—or any late taxes from previous years—could still be deducted on a tax return due this April.
Current tax law allows employees to deduct unreimbursed expenses related to their jobs as long as they’re more than 2 percent of income. The tax bill ends these itemized deductions after the end of this year. So, workers should think about whether they can pay —and get the receipts—for as many of these expenses as possible this month, said Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block in Kansas City, Missouri. Examples of unreimbursed expenses for employees might include tools and supplies, occupational taxes, work uniforms, union dues, and expenses for work-related travel. Self-employed people and business owners would still be able to deduct expenses under the new tax bill. 
Under the proposed law, you’ll no longer be allowed to deduct work-related moving expenses after the new year (unless you’re in the military). Of course it might be difficult to schedule a cross-country move on such short notice, but, “if you did move, make sure you clear up any moving-related expenses by Dec. 31,” said Fordham University accounting and taxation professor Stanley Veliotis. And if your destination happens to be a low-tax red state, maybe thank Santa Claus for your good luck.
After Jan. 1, individual taxpayers will no longer be able to deduct tax preparation fees. Any payments to accountants or tax software companies made this year, however, should still be deductible on tax returns filed in April. So, you might want to buy a tax software package now, or try to get an appointment with your CPA before the end of the year. Keep in mind that, like unreimbursed employee expenses, tax prep fees are deductions that only make sense if you itemize and if 
 exceed 2 percent of your income. 

=== Title: These Are the Tricks States May Use to Get Around the SALT Deduction - Bloomberg ===

Exploiting tax loopholes is a sport associated with rich people and their fancy accountants. State governments may have to start getting fancy, too.
Republican Senate and House negotiators in Washington 
 last week on a $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, or SALT. In high-tax states, that’s bad news. Personal taxes are poised to rise for 13 percent of New Yorkers and 11 percent of California and New Jersey residents, according to an 
 by left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, conducted after the bill’s final details were announced.
Financial planners and law professors to the rescue. It’s possible, they say, to concoct workarounds, like replacing income tax with payroll tax, and turning state tax into charitable donations. Far-fetched? Perhaps. But tax experts are already formulating ways to stop the feds from grabbing more take-home pay from Californians, New Yorkers and New Jerseyans while folks across America buy boats with the money they save.
“There are many hundreds of billions of dollars on the table over the next decade,” said David Kamin, a New York University School of Law professor. “There’s a lot of incentive for states to shift into forms of taxation that remain deductible.”
SALT opponents say the deduction encourages states to increase taxes because of the indirect subsidy by Washington. Those who oppose the new cap argue that states like New York and New Jersey pay more in federal taxes than they get back in federal spending, and that putting federal taxes in front of state and local levies violates states’ constitutional rights.
For now, not much is brewing in affected state capitals except discussion, but then again, the Republican tax proposals aren’t yet law. State legislators will have a lot of decisions to make about how their tax codes will change, so a stratagem to offset the loss of the SALT deduction could be part of bigger overhauls, said Darien Shanske, professor at the University of California-Davis School of Law.
“No one likes paying more in taxes,” Shanske said. “It’s likely to be especially aggravating to pay more in taxes when others are paying less.”
One tactic: Allow residents to make 
 to the state instead of paying income tax.
That would involve legislators encouraging residents to donate to, say, New Jersey (insert quip here), instead of paying income taxes. The self-interested philanthropists who took up the state on the offer would receive a state income-tax credit for the full amount of their gift, which would qualify for a federal deduction.
Wealthy taxpayers already use a similar ploy in 18 states that offer at least partial tax credits in return for donations to nonprofits that grant tuition vouchers to private and religious schools. It especially appeals to affluent filers who pay the alternative minimum tax, which doesn’t allow them to claim deductions for state and local levies.
In a memo released in 2011, the Internal Revenue Service gave its blessing for taxpayers to claim federal deductions on those gifts. The combination of a 100 percent state-tax credit and a federal deduction actually makes the gifts profitable for some donors, said Carl Davis, research director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
“It’s really just a mechanism in state law that lets people launder state income-tax payments and convert them into charitable contributions,” Davis said.
Alas, it would involve a loophole that’s easy to close, he said.
“Under the current rules, it’s workable,’’ he said. “But I don’t see Congress or the IRS letting a state get away with it very long.”
The charitable-gift gambit isn’t the only potential loophole. States could quit relying on income tax, paid by individuals, and switch to payroll taxes, levied on employers, according to a Dec. 7 
, “The Games People Play,” by a group of tax experts that includes Kamin and Shanske.
If employers pay the payroll tax and reduce employees’ salaries by the same amount, workers wouldn’t have to deduct anything and would wind up being paid the same amount. That would allow states to collect the same revenue while preserving individuals’ deductions on federal returns.
Channeling collections into payroll taxes would also allow both itemizers and non-itemizers to benefit, and states would keep more money within their borders.
States with progressive income-tax rates would need to devise a system of tax credits to make payroll taxes hit the right rates. Union contracts guaranteeing certain wage levels could be a challenge, as would explaining the changes so they don’t read as a tax hike when workers get their pay stubs.
The complexity of such tactics would probably be the main deterrent. Whether states respond may depend on whether residents complain loudly enough. As the new tax law takes effect, working to circumvent the SALT cap could be good politics in the blue states hit hardest by the change. 
The tactics amount to a zero-sum game between state and federal governments. To the degree that statehouses succeed in clawing back part or all of their SALT deductions, federal tax collectors would miss out on revenue they’re depending on to fund the corporate tax cuts at the center of the overhaul plan.
“The question is,’’ Davis said, “how far are the states going to push the envelope?”

=== Title: Here’s Where the GOP Tax Plan Stands Right Now - Bloomberg ===

Congressional Republicans kicked off the final leg of their six-week legislative sprint to overhaul the U.S. tax code and deliver a major policy victory for President Donald Trump before year’s end. The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the tax bill and Senate leaders intend to bring the measure up as soon as they get it.
For a summary of the bill’s contents, 
.
Here are the latest developments, updated throughout the day:
The House is poised to approve GOP tax legislation Tuesday -- with plans to hold a vote around 1:30 p.m., according to a Republican leadership aide who asked not to be named because the details are private.
But Democratic challenges could still provide some drama -- or at least, a brief delay -- after the bill heads to the Senate.
Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said his members have been scouring the bill for potential provisions that could be challenged on the Senate floor because they don’t relate to federal revenue or spending, or because they would add to the deficit after a decade -- violating the so-called Byrd rule.
“We’ve been at it for days and I think it’s extremely important,” Wyden said Monday evening. In practical terms, a successful challenge could force the bill back to the House for reconsideration -- without the offending portions. The delay would be only temporary.
A provision that would have repealed a prohibition against tax-exempt nonprofits, including churches, supporting or opposing political candidates was dropped from the final bill because of Byrd rule concerns.
Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas didn’t rule out the possibility of other issues involving the rule. “We’re still talking to the parliamentarian about that,” Cornyn said, referring to the Senate adviser on rules and procedures. “So we simply don’t know for sure. But that’s what this process is designed to tell us.”
Cornyn predicted that the House would send over the tax bill early Tuesday afternoon. “We’ll pass it either tomorrow night or Wednesday morning,” Cornyn said Monday.
Senate rules require 10 hours of debate on the bill, divided equally between Republicans and Democrats. But either side can elect to give up some of its time, and Republicans may do so to speed passage.
In the longer term, Democrats are warning that future legislation will be needed to correct drafting errors or other technical issues in the tax bill. The top Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, said Monday evening that he would be seeing the Rules Committee frequently because “there are going to be a series of technical corrections.” Neal cited the fast pace of the legislation -- which was introduced in the House a little over six weeks ago -- as one of the reasons for future fixes.
His fellow Democrats on the Rules Committee spent more than three hours picking apart the process that they said shut them out of any real discussion at every legislative step.
Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady acknowledged future work to be done on the U.S. tax code, including changes to retirement savings and tax provisions for start ups.
"We’re not done, by the way,” Brady said. “I think there are various ways to improve this.”
Despite their slim majority in the Senate, GOP leaders appear to have won over enough potential dissenters in their ranks. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine was one of the last to say she supports the bill on Monday, following Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and Marco Rubio of Florida declaring their support last week.
Meanwhile in the House, a handful of Republicans have said they won’t support the final bill, including John Faso of New York, Dana Rohrabacher of California and Leonard Lance of New Jersey -- but the “no” forces lack sufficient numbers to sink the bill. Most of the House GOP dissenters are from high-tax states and are concerned that the bill’s $10,000 limit on individuals’ state and local tax deductions will raise taxes on their middle-class constituents.
Trump, his advisers and Republican leaders continue to say the tax plan would help the middle class the most. But studies, including one Monday from Congress’s official scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, have found that lower income earners will actually see a higher tax burden by 2027, while high earners will see a more enduring benefit. -- Anna Edgerton, Kaustuv Basu and Laura Litvan

=== Title: GOP Tax Bill Hands Biggest Benefits to Top Earners, Study Says - Bloomberg ===

The final Republican tax bill would lower taxes on average across the income spectrum for the first eight years, with the largest benefits going to upper earners, according to a new 
 Monday by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.
Next year, the average federal tax cut would be $1,610, the study found. The bottom fifth of income-earners would get an average cut of $60 and those in the middle fifth would get a $930 cut on average, according to the analysis. The top 1 percent would get $51,140 on average, and the top 0.1 percent would get $193,380, it found.
President Donald Trump has said the tax plan’s biggest beneficiaries will be middle-income families, and the wealthiest Americans won’t gain from it.
In 2025, the average tax cut would fall to $1,570 on average. Those in the bottom fifth would get a cut of $70 and those in the middle fifth would get a cut of $910, according to the study. The top 1 percent would get $61,090 apiece and the top 0.1 percent would get $252,300, it found.
By 2027, individual breaks that are set to expire would lead to a tax increase for the bottom 60 percent of earners relative to existing law, while those on the higher end -- especially the top 1 percent -- would continue to see lower taxes, according to the analysis.
The analysis comes three days after the final legislation was made public and one day before the Republican-led House and aims to vote on it.

=== Title: Everything You Need to Know About the GOP Tax-Overhaul Plan - Bloomberg ===

Here are key changes to U.S. tax law for individuals and businesses that have emerged from the final Republican bill that’s headed for votes in the House and Senate next week.
(Note: Individual rate cuts would begin in 2018 and expire after 2025.)
Current law:
Proposed: 
Current law: 35 percent
Proposed: 21 percent, beginning in 2018.
Current law: Applies a 20 percent rate as part of a parallel tax system that limits tax benefits to prevent large-scale tax avoidance. Companies must calculate their ordinary tax and AMT tax, and pay whichever is higher.
Proposed: Repealed.
Current law: Individual AMT can apply after exemption level of $54,300 for singles and $84,500 for married, joint filers, and the exemptions phase out at higher incomes.
Proposed: Increase the exemption to $70,300 for singles and $109,400 for joint filers. Increase the phase-out threshold to $500,000 for singles and $1 million for joint filers. The higher limits would expire on Jan. 1, 2026.
Current law: Businesses must take depreciation, spreading the recognition of their equipment costs for tax purposes over several years.
Proposed: Businesses could fully and immediately deduct the cost of certain equipment purchased after Sept. 27, 2017 and before Jan. 1, 2023. After that, the percentage of cost that could be immediately deducted would gradually phase down.
Current law: The U.S. taxes multinationals on their global earnings at the corporate rate of 35 percent, but allows them to defer taxes on those foreign earnings until they bring them back to the U.S., or “repatriate” them.
Proposed: U.S. companies’ overseas income held as cash would be subject to a 15.5 percent rate, while non-cash holdings would face an 8 percent rate. Companies can make the payments in eight annual installments.
Current law: Pass-through businesses, which include partnerships, limited liability companies, S corporations and sole proprietorships, pass their income to their owners, who pay tax at their individual rates.
Proposed: Owners could apply a 20 percent deduction to their business income, subject to limits that would begin at $315,000 for married couples (or half that for single taxpayers).
Current law: An individual who fails to buy health insurance must pay penalties of $695 (higher for families) or 2.5 percent of their household income -- whichever is higher, but capped at the national average cost of the most basic, low-premium, high-deductible plan.
Proposed: Repeal the penalties.
Current law: $6,350 standard deduction for single taxpayers and $12,700 for married couples, filing jointly. Personal exemptions of $4,050 allowed for each family member.
Proposed: $12,000 standard deduction for single taxpayers and $24,000 for married couples, filing jointly. Personal exemptions repealed.
Current law: Individuals can deduct the state and local taxes they pay, but the value is subject to certain limits for high earners.
Proposed: Individuals can deduct no more than $10,000 worth of the deductions, which could include a combination of property taxes and either sales or income taxes.
Current law: Deductible mortgage interest is capped at loans of $1 million.
Proposed: Deductible mortgage interest for new purchases of first or second homes would be capped at loans of $750,000 starting on Jan. 1, 2018.
Current law: Qualified medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income are deductible.
Proposed: Reduce the threshold to 7.5 percent of AGI for 2017 and 2018.
Current law: A $1,000 credit for each child under 17. The credit begins phasing out for couples earning more than $110,000. The credit is at least partially refundable to qualified taxpayers who earned more than $3,000.
Proposed: Double the credit to $2,000 and provide it for each child under 17 through 2025. Raise the phase-out amount to $400,000, and cap the refundable portion at $1,400 in 2018.
Current law: Applies a 40 percent levy on estates worth more than $5.49 million for individuals and $10.98 million for couples.
Proposed: Double the thresholds so the levy applies to fewer estates. The higher thresholds would sunset in 2026.

=== Title: Bitcoin Futures Deliver Wild Ride as Debut Brings Rally, Halts - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin has landed on Wall Street.
Futures on the world’s most popular cryptocurrency surged as much as 26 percent in their debut session on Cboe Global Markets Inc.’s exchange, triggering two temporary trading halts designed to calm the market. 
 dealers’ expectations, while traffic on Cboe’s website was so heavy that it caused delays and temporary outages. The website’s problems had no impact on trading systems, Cboe said. Bitcoin’s spot price rose.
“It is rare that you see something more volatile than bitcoin, but we found it: bitcoin futures,” said Zennon Kapron, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Kapronasia.
The launch of futures on a regulated exchange is a watershed for bitcoin, whose surge this year has captivated everyone from mom-and-pop speculators to Wall Street trading firms. The Cboe contracts, soon to be followed by similar 
 from CME Group Inc. and 
 Inc., should make it easier for mainstream investors to bet on the cryptocurrency’s rise or fall.
Bitcoin wagers have until now been mostly limited to venues with little or no oversight, deterring institutional money managers and exposing some users to the risk of hacks and market breakdowns. About 20 trading firms actively participated, Cboe Chairman Ed Tilly said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
Bitcoin futures expiring in January were 18 percent higher at $17,710 as of 12:25 p.m. in New York from an opening level of $15,000, on 3,561 contracts traded.
“It was smooth, and bitcoin traders don’t seem to be put off by futures,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst in London at online trading firm Oanda. “There was a fear that short selling would have an adverse impact on price, but we haven’t seen that yet.”
The spot price climbed 4.7 percent to $16,383 from the Friday 5 p.m. close in New York, according to the composite price on Bloomberg.
The roughly $1,300 difference reflects not only the novelty of the asset but also the difficulty of using the cash-settled futures to trade against the spot, strategists said.
“In a normal, functioning market, good old arbitrage would settle this,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Hellerup, Denmark, said by email. “If they were deliverable you could arbitrage the life out of it.”
Proponents of regulated bitcoin derivatives say the contracts will increase market transparency and boost liquidity, but skeptics abound. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a “fraud,” while China’s government has cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges this year. The Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- said this month that contracts in the U.S. were 
 without enough consideration of the risks.
So far though, trading has kicked off without any major hiccups.
Dealers said volume was high for a new contract, even though it was tiny relative to more established futures. And the trading halts took effect just as Cboe had outlined in its rules. Transactions stopped for two minutes after a 10 percent gain from the opening price, and for five minutes after a 20 percent jump. Another five-minute halt will take effect if the rally extends to 30 percent, Cboe said in a notice on its website.
“It was pretty easy to trade,” Joe Van Hecke, managing partner at Chicago-based Grace Hall Trading LLC, said in a telephone interview from Charlotte, North Carolina. “I think you’ll see a robust market as time plays out.”
For now, Cboe futures account for a tiny slice of the world’s bitcoin-related bets. The notional value of contracts traded in the first eight hours totaled about $40 million. Globally, about $1.1 billion of bitcoin traded against the U.S. dollar during the same period, according to Cryptocompare.com.
Some people who would like to trade futures are having a hard time accessing the market because not all brokers are supporting it initially, said Garrett See, chief executive officer of DV Chain. Participation may also be limited because of higher capital requirements and tighter risk limits, See said.
“We’re in the early stages here, and there’s not enough professional liquidity from the big market makers who can provide depth and hold in the movements,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp. “It’s going to be a learning curve.”
It’s been painful for investors stuck on the sidelines. This year alone, bitcoin is up more than 17-fold. The surge has been driven largely by demand from individuals, with technical obstacles keeping out most big money managers like mutual funds.
The new derivatives contracts should thrust bitcoin more squarely into the realm of regulators, banks and institutional investors. Both Cboe and CME on Dec. 1 got permission to offer the contracts after pledging to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the products don’t run afoul of the law, in a process called self-certification.
Not everyone is happy with the roll out. Exchanges failed to get enough feedback from market participants on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests and clearing, the Futures Industry Association said this month. In November, Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire chairman of Interactive Brokers Group Inc., wrote an open letter to CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, arguing that bitcoin’s large price swings mean its futures contracts shouldn’t be allowed on platforms that clear other derivatives.
Still, Interactive Brokers is offering its customers access to the futures, with greater restrictions. The firm’s clients won’t be able to go short, and Interactive’s margin requirement, or how much investors have to set aside as collateral, will be at least 50 percent. That’s a stricter threshold than both Cboe’s and CME’s.
The start of futures trading is an important milestone for bitcoin’s shift from the fringes of finance toward the mainstream, but it could be some time before the cryptocurrency becomes a key part of investor portfolios -- if it ever does.
“You never say never,” David Riley, who helps oversee $57 billion as head of credit strategy at BlueBay Asset Management LLP in London, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “But I do think we’re quite some way from making cryptocurrencies even a relatively small part of some of the funds we manage at the moment.”

=== Title: Steinhoff Bonds Plunge After Moody's Cuts Rating to Junk - Bloomberg ===

 bonds extended losses after Moody’s Investors Service slashed the credit rating to junk in the wake of an accounting scandal that’s threatening the survival of the global furniture and clothing retailer.
Moody’s cut its rating by four notches late on Thursday, highlighting “the uncertainties and implications for the company’s liquidity and debt capital structure.” The move comes as South African regulators step up probes that follow a review in Germany, where Steinhoff moved its primary listing two years ago.
The owner of Conforama in France, Mattress Firm in the U.S. and the U.K.’s Poundland said late Tuesday that Chief Executive Officer Markus Jooste had quit after the discovery of accounting irregularities, although Chief Financial Officer Ben La Grange remains in place. The disclosures prompted a dramatic selloff in the company’s shares that has wiped out more than 80 percent of the company’s value this week.
“There’s no way back,” David Shapiro, deputy chairman of Sasfin Wealth in Johannesburg, said in emailed comments on Friday. “The worry is that there are a huge number of operating companies within the stable – if you were a supplier to these businesses would you sell goods on credit? I reckon they should file for Chapter 11 or business rescue and try and salvage what they can.”
Steinhoff has its roots in South Africa and has expanded aggressively around the world with a series of acquisitions, including Mattress Firm and Poundland, and now has 130,000 employees worldwide. It’s hired PwC to examine the financial wrongdoing, postponed the publication of full-year earnings and put non-core assets up for sale.
The retailer’s biggest shareholder is billionaire Chairman 
, who has stepped in to take temporary charge of the company. He hasn’t yet responded to requests for comment.
The yield on its 800 million euro ($914 million) bonds due January 2025 rose 129 basis points to 11.05 percent. The shares were highly volatile Friday, trading 7 percent lower at 57.17 euros as of 12:12 p.m. in Frankfurt, after another early plunge of as much as 45 percent.
Steinhoff said Thursday that it’s considering boosting liquidity by selling assets worth at least 1 billion euros and reviewing the recoverability of non-South African assets worth a further 6 billion euros. The retailer has scheduled a meeting with the lenders of two of its syndicated debt facilities for Monday, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The Pretoria-based Financial Services Board has started an independent probe into possible false and misleading financial reports, while the Public Investment Corp., Steinhoff’s second-largest shareholder and a manager of South African government-worker pension funds, said it’s awaiting information from investigations. The PIC owns a 10 percent stake in Steinhoff, which is now worth $1.1 billion less than two days ago.
South African Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said he’s “mindful” that many retirement and savings funds will be hurt by the loss in value and has asked the PIC to prepare a report on the extent of the exposure.
“I think it is the end,” Simon Brown, Johannesburg-based chief executive officer of trading company JustOneLap. “The end will be a break up. There are lots of decent businesses that others will want to buy and it’s likely they’ll fetch decent prices. so staff will mostly be fine, except in head office.”

=== Title: Best Winter Vacations for People Who Want to Do Nothing at All - Bloomberg ===

It's a request travel experts get more often than you think: What if a person wants to go somewhere wintry, and do ... nothing?
Sure, the snow and cold weather offer plenty of active delights: skiing, sledding, trekking, ice fishing. But let the masses head to ski resorts and the hardcore head off into the backcountry. For a certain set, it's other things they're after: dog sled rides, solving puzzles, going to concert performances, racking up some serious hot tub time, and just parking one's self in front of the fire. Thanks to the destinations below, you can do all that and less while wrapped in the lap of luxury. 
From November through February, 30-foot swells and gale-force winds lash the western shores of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, putting on an awesome show for guests at the 
. The Wick, as regulars call it, was designed for storm watching, a favorite childhood pastime of the owner. Each of the 75 rooms has unobstructed Pacific views, a gas fireplace, and a soaking tub. Intrepid guests can don ponchos and wellies and experience a “west coast facial,” which occurs when the rain goes sideways in the wind and massages your face as you walk along Chesterman Beach. Too intense? Book a Pacific Sea Salt Glow facial at the Ancient Cedars Spa and Zen out to the sound of crashing waves. 
Schloss Elmau brings the best of New York or Berlin to a tranquil valley in the Bavarian Alps in southern Germany. The 
—composed of a 162-room, family-friendly hotel, a 47-suite retreat, and six spas—is the ultimate digital detox. Its world-class concert hall hosts 200 performances a year (with tickets included in the room rate), including a popular Chamber Music Festival each January and literary talks from authors such as Ian McEwan and T.C. Boyle. Though the hotel offers Apple TV and high speed Wi-Fi, why not unplug your devices and chill out in the three libraries and on-site bookstore instead? 
There’s nothing cozy about the Alaskan wilderness, unless you’re staying in one of the five knotty pine guest cabins at Winterlake Lodge. Operated by the Dixon family, 
 is set on 15 acres overlooking a frozen lake and primarily accessible by seaplane. The lodge has its own team of huskies, and Carl Dixon gives mushing tutorials, but he’ll happily take the reins while guests enjoy views from the sleigh. Head into the wild on a helicopter safari in search of elk, moose, caribou, and badgers, then return to pre-dinner wine and cheese by the fire. Carl’s wife, Kirsten, is an award-winning chef, so save room for her multi-course dinners of reindeer tenderloin with duck fat potatoes and mushroom-and-truffle gnocchi. 
Fashion-industry veterans Giorgia and Stefano Barbini reimagined a 16th century hunting lodge in Italy’s Dolomites as a luxurious mountain escape for friends. Now San Lorenzo Lodge, their 
, mixes classic alpine decor  with updated touches such as underfloor heating and a spruce sauna. In the winter, Stefano hosts woodcarving workshops and leads moonlit snowshoe tours. This being Italy, though, food is at the heart of the experience. Each evening, Giorgia prepares a feast of regional recipes, which Stefano pairs with wine from the stable-turned-1,500-bottle cellar. 
Set on a 4,200-acre estate at the foothills of Tennessee’s Smoky Mountains, 
 is the perfect place to hibernate for a winter weekend. With a working farm, craft brewery, and one of the deepest wine collections in America (160,000-plus bottles) this is foodie nirvana. Leisurely days start with digging into fluffy egg-topped cheese grits and crispy bacon while watching the fog roll across the mountains.  Read in a rocking chair, get pampered at the Wellhouse Spa, or sign up for a winter-enrichment weekend focused on such obsessions as puzzling or photography. Evenings revolve around fancy farm-to-table meals in a restored barn and often end with a nightcap of Pappy van Winkle by the fire in the Hickory Room. 
Fogo Island, located off the northern coast of Newfoundland, is about as off-the-grid as one can get. Its austere landscape is even more extraordinary in the winter, when the 29-suite 
 becomes a haven for artists, foodies, and burnt-out urbanites looking for rest and relaxation. Guests looking to connect with nature can track caribou by snowshoe or, in March, view giant sheets of ice floating down Iceberg Alley from Greenland to the North Atlantic. An artist-in-residency program and a 37-seat cinema satisfy cultural cravings, while rooftop hot tubs are meant for meditative star-gazing sessions. 
Located just a half-hour’s drive from the major ski resorts in southern Vermont, 
 feels like an elevated take on the classic New England bed-and-breakfast. Its famous soufflé pancakes are reason alone to book a stay. A main lodge, housed in an 18th century farmhouse, features four rooms decorated with vintage flags, antique quilts, and other Americana. Sixteen individually designed cottages are scattered across the 300-acre grounds, all with fieldstone fireplaces and screened-in porches. Guests can go sledding out the door then thaw out in the spa’s Japanese 
, a type of sleek, wooden bathtub. For a more social stay, check out the inn’s 
 event series, which includes furniture-making workshops with local woodworker Thomas Shackleton and murder mystery weekends. 
Dude ranches are best known for action-fueled summer activities. When the snow falls, rates drop and the pace slows. At Triple Creek Ranch, an adults-only, 
 in Montana’s Bitterroot Range, the focus shifts from cattle drives and horseback riding to snowshoeing and ice fishing. Couples hunker down in log cabins equipped with wood-burning fireplaces and, in most cases, hot tubs; oftentimes, they don’t reappear until dinner. Meals at the Relais & Châteaux-approved restaurant (think wagyu beef with caramelized fennel home fries, paired with a rare Bordeaux) are a highlight of every stay. 

=== Title: Lamborghini Finally Unveils the $200,000 Urus SUV - Bloomberg ===

Today in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy, Lamborghini unveiled the Urus. 
The long-awaited SUV fills the gap in the automaker’s lineup previously bereft of a utility vehicle. Lamborghini is among the last automakers worldwide to add an SUV or crossover to its portfolio of models.
Urus has a 650-horsepower, 4.0 liter V8 twin-turbo engine and gets 850 Nm of torque from a 4WD, eight-speed automatic transmission. It can hit 62 mph in 3.6 seconds and will continue accelerating all the way to 190 mph. The standard model rolls on 21-inch rims and comes with adaptive air suspension and carbon ceramic brakes, as well as active roll stabilization. 
Inside, the Urus has a slim dashboard inspired by the no-nonsense, military-style 
. Lamborghini-signature hexagonal shapes grace the air vents, door handles, and cup holders. It has seating for four or five, depending on whether the buyer chooses the rear bench seat or a 2+2 seating format. High-quality leather, alcantara, carbon fiber, and polished woods are replete throughout. This being Lamborghini, upgrades are always upgrades, such as 23-inch rims, a 1,700 watt Bang & Olufsen 3D sound system with 21 speakers, or an off-road package with reinforced bumpers and underfloor protection.  
Urus also features such new technologies for Lamborghini as a rear tailgate that is electrically operated via a switch on the driver’s door, a button on the key, or a manual button on the tailgate itself. Users may find rear space lacking; the low roofline styling of the small “sport coupe” BMW X6 is apparent here as well, and rear-seat room in the X6 comes at a premium. 
The $200,000 utility vehicle is the Italian company’s first since it halted production of the LM002 in 1993. Company executives unveiled a concept of the rig five years ago, but this is the first time they have shown a real-life production version to the public. As has long been tradition at the automaker, the name Urus is derived from the world of bulls: Urus, also known as Aurochs, was one of the large, wild ancestors of today’s domesticated cattle.  
“Lamborghini is a hidden gem, and adding the Urus SUV will propel volume closer to Italian rival Ferrari,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michael Dean said in an note 
. The model could lift the brand’s earnings by more than 50 percent in 2019, Dean said. The Urus will more than double the company's annual output of fewer than 3,500 units sold worldwide, according to Lamborghini.
Indeed, the addition of the Urus to Lamborghini’s otherwise 
 of track-ready supercars—most outfitted with dihedral doors or outré spoilers that scream for attention—is intended to expand its appeal to both families and female buyers. It’s fairly small for an SUV and has multiple entertainment and personalization settings meant to appeal to younger, cosmopolitan buyers or anyone looking for a Lamborghini he or she can comfortably use in places other than a racetrack.
Chief Executive Officer Stefano
Domenicali
“A bull is always aggressive, but I would like to give us a new philosophy toward the future: A bull can be gentle,” he 
 last year. 
Roughly 5 percent of the company’s global buyers are female, according to Lamborghini, and most of them live in the U.S. and Europe. (In the U.S., women buy 53 percent of all small SUVs and 48 percent of small premium SUVs, according to J.D. Power & Associates.)
The SUV is also expected to help boost the brand in China, the world’s largest auto market, where buyers prefer large sedans and crossovers. Last year Lamborghini sold a mere 188 units in China, compared with 303 in the U.K., a market 
 smaller. 
Deliveries of the Urus start in Spring 2018.  
 

=== Title: The Easiest Cocktails to Make for All Your Holiday Parties - Bloomberg ===

Holiday party season is upon us. And if you’re hosting, the question of what drinks to serve is almost as pressing as gift lists.
As with most things, the trick, of course, is to not overthink it.  
“People are looking for more streamlined drinks,” says Kara Newman, spirits editor for 
I think it's a backlash to years of overwrought cocktail books written by bartenders who mean well but have access to a bar that's so much more vast than anyone has at home. No one should need 10 bottles to make a single drink.”
In 
 (2016, Chronicle Books), Newman has found that the easiest “easy” cocktails are the ones that have equal proportions of ingredients. She advises prebatching the drinks and chilling them in the fridge. Skip the bitsy jigger and simply pour cupfuls into a pitcher, stir, and decant into bottles.
“That's the beauty of equal-parts drinks, they scale beautifully,” enthuses Newman. “You don't really need a recipe. You don't even really need a measuring cup—you could use a Quaker Oatmeal canister, and as long as you measure the same amount of every ingredient, the drink will work.”
There’s one caveat: If the drink is meant to be shaken or stirred with ice, but you opt to pop it into your fridge instead, be sure to add a little water to approximate the dilution you would have gotten as you mixed each individually. 
Robert Simonson, the celebrated drinks and liquor writer at the 
, has also written a book that doubles as a resource for stressed hosts. His 
 (2017, Ten Speed Press) points out that classic cocktails have endured because they are, by and large, simple.
“If 
 had eight ingredients, nobody would be making it today—at least not at home and probably not at many bars,” he opines in his book. He doubled down on that in an email, noting that there’s a move at present toward simplicity. “After many years of bars serving up rococo cocktails with elaborate presentations, I do think there is at present a movement back toward simplicity. Complex cocktails will always have their place, but that place should be in the bar, in the hands of professionals.”
He notes that besides his and Newman’s books, more are on the way, such as Maggie Hoffman’s upcoming 
.  “They are a reminder that excellence is within the grasp of the home bartender without maxing out your credit card at the liquor store and renting a U-Haul to bring your purchases home.” Amen.
Whatever you decide to make—and we have five can’t-fail recipes below—use top-notch liquor and think about having two instead of five. To paraphrase venerated mixologist Jim Meehan, this holiday drinking season 
.
 
3-Ingredient Cocktails 
The author created this drink for a party at an architecture gallery decorated in white that didn’t want to risk the spillage of dark spirits. It cleverly riffs on the classic, brandy-based Harvard.
Serves 12
24 oz. pisco
12 oz. bianco vermouth
About 36 dashes of orange bitters
12 lemon twists 
In a large pitcher, combine all the ingredients except the lemon twists. Add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into another pitcher or container and refrigerate until serving.
To serve, pour into chilled coupes. Twist a lemon twist over each drink, drop into the glass and serve.
 
Shake. Stir. Sip. 
Serves 12
Like a regular Negroni—equal parts gin, sweet vermouth, and Campari—Newman notes that it’s easy to scale this drink up or down; you can double it for a bigger crowd or make just one drink. New York bartender Lynnette Marrero created this variation in which the rich, deep tones of aged rum combined with luscious amontillado really do evoke caramel and toffee without overt sweetness.
12 oz. aged rum
12 oz. amontillado sherry
12 oz. Aperol
12 grapefruit twists
In a large pitcher, combine the rum, sherry, and Aperol. Add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into another pitcher or container and refrigerate until serving.
To serve, pour into a rocks glass over a large cube of ice. Garnish with a grapefruit twist.
 
Shake. Stir. Sip. 
Serves 12
Newman credits Audrey Saunders, co-owner of New York’s famed Pegu Club, for reviving this martini style, tweaking it, and giving it a saucier name. “This is literally two ingredients, in equal parts. It does not get any easier than this.” 
36 oz. gin
36 oz. dry vermouth
24 dashes orange bitters
12 lemon twists
In a large pitcher, combine the gin, vermouth, and bitters. Add about ½ cup of water to mimic ice dilution. Refrigerate until serving.
To serve, pour into chilled martini glasses and garnish with lemon twists.
Note: To make a more classic martini, omit the orange bitters and substitute olives for the twists.
 
Serves 12
Waugh calls this the “Millionaire’s Tequila Old Fashioned”—Don Julio 1942, a premium aged tequila, meets Don the Beachcomber, thanks to a cinnamon-grapefruit-flavor combo known in the trade as “Don’s Mix.” Keep this one reserved for more intimate occasions.
12 oz. Don Julio 1942
12 oz. añejo tequila
6 oz. Grapefruit-Cinnamon Syrup (see below)
24 dashes Bittermens Elemakule Tiki bitters or Angostura bitters
12 grapefruit twists for garnish (optional)
In a large pitcher combine all the ingredients except the grapefruit twists. Add about ½ cup of water to mimic dilution. Refrigerate until serving.
To serve, pour into rocks glasses with one large ice cube and garnish with grapefruit twists.
To make Grapefruit-Cinnamon Syrup, simmer cane syrup (or equal parts water and sugar) with 2 to 3 cinnamon sticks over low heat for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add large strips of zest from 1 grapefruit, and let infuse until the syrup is flavored. Keep the extra on hand for all your tequila drinks.  
Serves 16-20
During the holiday season, Levy turns (and returns) to this simple, hassle-free punch recipe with three easy-to-find ingredients that anyone can whip up in three minutes. “That inspired the name, the Trifecta Punch. Gin is a nice alternative to brown spirits often used in punch. Slightly bitter Aperol provides contrast and lends a great winter feel.”
24 oz. gin 
12 oz. Aperol
64 oz. chilled sparkling rosé wine
Cranberries, for garnish
In a pitcher, combine the gin and Aperol. Stir and refrigerate until serving.
To serve, add the sparkling rosé wine and stir again gently. Pour into rocks glasses or cups and garnish with cranberries.

=== Title: A Dashboard Gadget That Will Totally Change How You Drive - Bloomberg ===

It was the last car on the rental lot: a white Nissan Altima that looked as if it had hit every pothole and puddle between Ohio, where it got its license plate, and Fort Lauderdale, where it was now parked.
I was at the beginning of a long weekend and had about 600 miles of driving ahead of me. This time, I vowed, I would give myself the kind of upgrade the rental agency wouldn’t—a heads-up display from 
, a $499 aftermarket gadget that sits on top of your dash and gives almost any car that Top Gun feeling.
My usual routine, whether driving my own car or in a rental, is to fire up Google Maps on my phone, stick it in the cup holder, and steal glances as necessary. The promise of heads-up display technology, on the other hand, is that it gives you the information you need as a driver—speed and navigation, primarily—without ever taking your eyes off the road. Using technology first applied in fighter jets, this is typically done by projecting the information onto your windshield in such a way that it appears to float in space, usually right around the the end of the hood of your car.
Those displays are floating above many hoods these days. The 2018 Lincoln Navigator, which uses a “digital light projection” technology frequently used in movie theaters, creates what they say is the largest, brightest automotive display in its category. Because your line of sight needs to be just so to see the HUD, some luxury cars like Mercedes and Volvos will save the position of the display to match your seat settings. Not all car makers have embraced the technology, however. Drive a Porsche or a Tesla, or an old Audi, for example, and you are out of luck.
Enter Navdy. It’s the leader in a growing field that ranges from budget apps, which reflect your phone’s screen onto your windshield, to Garmin’s $179 HUD+. The Navdy consists of an adhesive base, which sticks to the dashboard; the display unit, which connects to the base magnetically; and a scrolling thumb controller that straps onto the steering wheel.
The Navdy projects its information onto a clear lens, about 6 inches wide and 2 inches high. (Mazda also uses this lens-based approach). The effect, ultimately, is the same as a HUD that’s embedded in your dash, even if the implementation is a little unwieldy.
It gets its information from two sources: your phone, which connects via Bluetooth and its app, and the car’s on-board diagnostic, or OBD-II port, through which the Navdy collects such performance data about your vehicle as speed, engine temperature, and fuel consumption. The OBD-II port also provides power to the Navdy, which means that it works only in cars made after 1996, when the port became standard. It also means a cable runs from the base to the OBD-II port, usually located beneath the base of your steering wheel, or near the fuse panel. Cable stays keep the whole affair tidy, but there’s no way to hide the wires entirely.
Installation takes about 15 minutes, but getting used to the display takes a little longer. The default mode shows speed and RPM in the center, with additional information—time, g-force, engine temperature, and compass heading—in flanking displays you can scroll through as needed. Alerts for lurking speed cameras, or subtle notifications for the vanishingly rare moments I exceeded the speed limit, made themselves known without being distracting. When in GPS mode, the bulk of the display is filled with a turn-by-turn map display. Destinations are entered by voice—just hold down the button on the thumb wheel and say where you want to go.
Beyond the purely functional aspects of driving, Navdy serves as something of a media and communications hub. Alongside your speed or navigation information, emails and text messages can pop up in “Glances,” should you choose to have them do so. There’s an option to have them read aloud, as well. You can also engage or dismiss these messages with a wave of your hand, though I found that the thumb wheel was a more natural, less distracting way of dealing with them. Replies are canned (“I’m driving with Navdy. Call me”) but customizable.
For the first few hours, particularly while I was noodling around with it to set up Spotify over the car’s speakers, I found it could be just as diverting as anything on my dashboard. After a while, it became a part of the landscape, like any other road sign or traffic signal. It was only when I returned to my own car, with my cup-holder GPS method, that I realized the extent to which my eyes were taken from the road by that arrangement.
But I left it thinking that this is the way we’ll all be driving in the future. Like the transition to electric—or autonomous—vehicles, HUDs seem to be a logical, inevitable next step. Car manufacturers seem to think so too: Groupe Renault just announced that 
 with its cars throughout Europe in 2018.

=== Title: This Central Bank Crisis Tool Might Actually Hurt: Eco Pulse - Bloomberg ===

Economists give negative interest rates a scathing review in new research, dealing an intellectual blow to a policy tool that could be one of central bankers’ last resorts in future recessions. 
Benchmark interest rates 
 against zero from 30 percent to 40 percent of the time in the U.S. going forward, and their neutral setting has fallen the world over. That makes questions about the efficacy of negative rates of utmost importance. Unfortunately for monetary policy makers, Brown University’s Gauti Eggertsson and his co-authors call negative-rate policies “at best irrelevant” in the research leading off this week’s economic roundup.
We also take a look at studies on student loan default, prospects for productivity growth and how Federal Reserve rate increases affect corporate borrowing costs. Check this column each Tuesday for short summaries of new findings from around the world. 
The fallout from the global financial crisis saw the European Central Bank, Swiss National Bank and Bank of Japan push rates below zero, to debatable effect. Eggertsson, a former New York Fed researcher, Ella Getz Wold and Ragnar Juelsrud suggest that such policies might be counterproductive. 
When policy rates dip below zero, the usual transmission mechanism for monetary policy – where banks pass on policy rates to consumer-facing interest rates – breaks down, they find in their National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. If that holds in future downturns, it means consumers won’t have added incentive to move money out of savings, as theory would suggest. Nor will they benefit from extra-attractive loan rates designed to spur borrowing. At the same time, the policies could reduce bank profits, so they may even hurt economic growth.
The finding has been previously 
 at a European Central Bank conference, but it bears revisiting because of its potential importance for the future monetary toolkit. It’s worth noting that this is hardly the last word on negative rates. Find a sunnier review of the policy 
. 
Not all student loan risk is created equal. More than 40 percent of students who take on debt to attend private, for-profit schools for associates degrees default, New York Fed research shows. That compares to less than 20 percent for students who attend private, not-for-profit, four-year programs. Surprisingly, above-average family income only slightly improves default rates for for-profit students. The research tracks students born from 1980 to 1986 (a subset of early Millennials and late Generation X, depending on how you define them).
Productivity grew slightly faster than expected over the last four quarters – at a 1.5 percent pace – causing Michael Feroli at JPMorgan Chase & Co. to look into whether we’re about to see a break from the tepid trend. Not so fast, he concludes.
Labor quality is facing long-term challenges as college education rates level off and Baby Boomers retire, and capital deepening, the other major driver of efficiency, would need to be stronger to push productivity toward major progress. In fact, he estimates that we’d need to see 1990’s-style capital investment to generate notable improvements to productivity.  That’s “aspirational,” to borrow Feroli’s word, even if a tax plan passes Congress. 
If the Fed hikes rates at a pace envisioned in its September 
, U.S. nonfinancial corporation interest payments would rise by $15 billion in 2018 and $37 billion in 2019. That means the interest coverage ratio of non-banks – the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense – would drop to 4.1 percent in 2019 from 4.6 in a scenario in which rates stay put, economists at the Fed Board in Washington find. 
Don’t look toward the job market to heal the divides between Democrats and Republicans. Blue states have enjoyed a stronger jobs recovery than their Republican counterparts, Robin Brooks at the Institute of International Finance notes, probably because the make-up of the recovery is favoring jobs in those places. 
 

=== Title: Low Inflation Is No Puzzle, San Francisco Fed Finds: Eco Pulse - Bloomberg ===

Inflation has become the great mystery of 2017 for Federal Reserve policy makers, but maybe it isn’t so baffling after all. 
That’s the conclusion reached in new San Francisco Fed research, which takes a look at the components of inflation. The ones that respond to the business cycle appear to have picked up – it’s everything else causing the problem. It’s the first study in this week’s economic wrap, which also looks at the outlook for global food demand, the utility of natural rates, the cyclical nature of student loan defaults and German labor participation among older workers. Check this column each Tuesday for the latest research from around the world. 
Price gains in the U.S. have been holding stubbornly below the Fed’s 2 percent target, puzzling officials as unemployment falls steadily lower. New San Francisco Fed research shows that when you look at sub-indexes that are pro-cyclical, meaning they respond to slack in the economy, inflation has returned to its pre-recession level. It’s the categories that don’t respond strongly to changes in the business cycle that have been persistently low, “suggesting that idiosyncratic factors have helped hold down PCE inflation.” 
For example, cuts to Medicare payment growth rates have been holding down health-care sector inflation, which will probably continue to drag on overall price gains in the foreseeable future. “While some cuts are expected to dissipate in the coming years, it seems unlikely that Medicare payment growth will return to its pre-recession level under current legislation,” researchers Tim Mahedy and Adam Shapiro write. 
As the global population grows and low-income countries play catchup, food demand could more than double by 2050, 
. 
Former International Monetary Fund research director Olivier Blanchard casts a skeptical eye on the natural rate of unemployment in a new paper, concluding that monetary policy makers should still use the concept – but very cautiously. Quick review: Milton Friedman laid out a hypothesis 50 years ago that there’s a level of unemployment that arises from structural quirks in the economy, and which is independent of monetary policy. If the central bank allows joblessness to stay below that level for an extended period of time, it will push inflation higher. The problem with this theory, a backbone of modern monetary policy, is that the relationship between unemployment and price gains hasn’t really held up for the past 20 years. 
Still, there isn’t enough evidence to disprove it, so officials should keep the natural rate hypothesis as their base case, Blanchard concludes. That said, in a world where evidence against the theory is slowly piling up, they should also “keep an open mind and put some weight on the alternatives.” For example, it might be worth letting the job market overshoot in order to pull workers back from the sidelines. 
Students who left college at the height of the recession were the most likely to default on their student loans, New York Fed research shows. The group of students entering repayment in 2010 and 2011 (the ones who graduated in 2009 and 2010) posted higher default rates than subsequent groups, who graduated into a healing labor market. That probably owed to the students’ trouble finding work as unemployment spiked. High default rates during and after the crisis may also owe in part to the fact that people poured into for-profit colleges to weather the downturn, graduating with comparatively poor job prospects. Associate degree students, dropouts, arts and humanities students, and students who attended what the researchers term “nonselective” colleges experienced higher increases in default rates than their peers.
German men have been staying in the labor market longer, and researchers from the Max Planck Institute think you can probably chalk that up to changes in pension regulations – in particular the phasing in of actuarial adjustments for early retirement. Education, health and spousal employment don’t seem to explain the U-shaped trend, based on the authors’ analysis. While older women have also been posting higher labor-force participation figures in Germany, that probably reflects a secular trend: Rising participation is true across the age distribution for women and has proceeded steadily, which is not the case for men. 

=== Title: Suspicious Deaths of Billionaire Canada Couple Investigated - Bloomberg ===

Canadian police continue to weigh whether to open a homicide investigation after the deaths of billionaire pharmaceutical executive Bernard “Barry” Sherman and his wife shocked the country’s corporate and political worlds.
The bodies of the 75-year-old founder of 
 and his wife Honey Sherman were found in their home in the Toronto neighborhood of North York on Friday under what police called suspicious circumstances.
Tributes poured in from prominent Canadians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. As media reports citing anonymous sources surfaced Saturday, the Shermans’ children issued a statement calling for a full criminal investigation, and criticizing the police and the media.
“We are shocked and think it’s irresponsible that police sources have reportedly advised the media of a theory which neither their family, their friends nor their colleagues believe to be true,” the Shermans’ children said. They derided “rumors” about the circumstances of the parents’ deaths, adding that the pair “shared an enthusiasm for life.”
“We urge the Toronto Police Service to conduct a thorough, intensive and objective criminal investigation, and urge the media to refrain from further reporting as to the cause of these tragic deaths until the investigation is completed,” the family said in the statement.
Toronto police were waiting on autopsy results, which were expected on Saturday, before determining if the service’s homicide unit would take over the case.
“We are treating the deaths as suspicious,” Toronto Police Constable David Hopkinson said in a phone interview. Investigators aren’t searching for any suspects at this time, he said.
Tributes flooded in as news of the Shermans’ deaths spread. “Our condolences to their family & friends, and to everyone touched by their vision & spirit,” Trudeau wrote on Twitter.
In a 
 on Saturday, Apotex hailed Sherman’s role in growing the company from a two-person firm in 1974 to a global giant -- one of the world’s largest generic drug makers, employing some 11,000 people including more than 6,000 in Canada.
Sherman “gave his life to the singular purpose of our organization -- innovating for patient affordability,” Apotex said in the statement. “Patients around the world live healthier and more fulfilled lives thanks to his life’s work.”
Sherman, who had a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was chairman of the closely held Canadian generic-drug maker and 
 chair of Cangene Corp., a Canadian biotechnology firm. He was ranked recently by Forbes as Canada’s 12th-richest person with a net worth of about $3 billion.
The billionaire held a fundraiser for Trudeau in August 2015, shortly before his Liberals won the election, that was later reportedly investigated by the country’s lobbying watchdog.
Linda Frum, a Canadian senator who recently awarded a medal to Honey Sherman for community service, was among those paying tribute to someone she described as one of the most beloved members of Canada’s Jewish community.
“I am gutted by the loss of Honey and Barry Sherman. Our community is steeped in grief. I am heartbroken,” she said on Twitter.
Eric Hoskins, health minister of Ontario province, described the couple as “incredible philanthropists” and said he was “beyond words right now.” Brad Duguid, Ontario’s minister for economic development, said he was “deeply shocked & saddened.”
The Shermans’ 12,440-square-foot home had recently been placed on the market for almost C$7 million ($5.4 million).

=== Title: Cities Are Winning as Millennials Spend on Services: Eco Pulse - Bloomberg ===

Bars, gyms and restaurants packed densely into downtown areas have played a “decisive role” in drawing young college graduates to city centers, revitalizing America’s urban landscape. 
That’s the conclusion of the lead study in this week’s research wrap. Other papers and posts show factors in a child’s environment that predict adult innovation, underline the sunnier side of monetary policy spillovers and highlight a perk of lightening consumer debt loads. Check this column each week for new and thought-provoking economic work from around the world. 
In a well-worn meme, Millennials are skipping out on homes and kids and spending money on things like avocado toast and spin classes. That trend is giving cities a boost, based on this working paper by University of California Berkeley’s Victor Couture and University of Pennsylvania’s Jessie Handbury.
Between 2000 and 2010, young, educated Americans flocked to population centers, and that change seems to have been driven by their comparatively high demand for services, which are more concentrated in cities. Initial levels of amenities like bars, gyms and personal services explain between 50 to 80 percent of the group’s urbanization, the researchers find. Factors like the slight increase in the concentration of higher-wage jobs played a less important role. 
The trends probably came as fewer people formed families, the authors find, because singles have a higher demand for amenities and urban living. Rising disposable incomes in the early 2000’s could have played a role, though the Great Recession hit toward the end of the research period, obscuring the trend. 
Children born to parents in the top 1 percent of the income distribution are 10 times as likely to become inventors than those born to families with below-median income, according to findings of a group of five researchers including Stanford University’s Raj Chetty. Children who grow up in areas where a lot of patents are filed are much more likely to go on to invent themselves, and children whose parents or parents' colleagues hold patents are more likely to patent in the same field, suggesting exposure also matters.
One thing that isn’t a great indicator of future inventiveness? Natural ability. Low-income kids who achieve top scores in math in the third grade are still much less likely to file a patent later in life, when compared to their higher-income peers. 
If capable people fail to invent simply because they lack exposure to innovation, it means society is leaving potential talent on the table, the authors note. At a time when productivity has slumped and new inventions are harder and harder to come by (see: 
), that matters a lot. 
When it comes to wealth, houses are still the middle class’ mainstay. 
 
Unconventional monetary policy in the U.S. boosted Canada’s industrial output by an average of 0.127 percent per month as the two countries recovered from the Great Recession. That’s even more than the change brought about by Canada’s own policy, which promised rates would stay low as long as inflation wasn't expected to take off.  
“Our work contributes to an alternative perspective on unconventional monetary policy spillovers: that under certain circumstances, in particular when international monetary policy is coordinated, such spillovers can be favourable,” the authors write. 
Central banks might have more room to maneuver in future crises if they can keep household debt under control today, research by the Bank for International Settlements suggests. If consumers have a lot of debt, and especially a lot of debt with short maturity, then interest-rate increases curb economic activity by more than an equally-sized rate cut would expand it.
This is because credit-constrained borrowers cut consumption a lot in response to rate hikes, but don’t expand consumption as much in response to lower borrowing costs. As a result, macro-prudential policies like loan-to-value caps and credit growth caps can have a positive effect on monetary policy by containing debt levels and affording officials greater wiggle room. 

=== Title: Why Arbitrage Traders Are Salivating Over Bitcoin Futures - Bloomberg ===

The proverbial free lunch is just sitting there in the hours-old bitcoin futures market. So why isn’t it being gobbled up?
Cboe Global Markets Inc.’s new contracts were priced as much as 13 percent higher than bitcoin itself since trading began Sunday night, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That should have arbitrage traders salivating, especially among market makers starving after their -- already successful and hugely profitable -- efforts to make other similar assets trade in lockstep. Pity the poor S&P 500 arb living off spreads well below 1 percent, or merger arbs in the U.S., where the median gap is just north of 1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Arbitrage will close that gap, but it will be days and weeks,” Cboe Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly said on Bloomberg Television Monday, less than a day after launching the product.
Arbs make money when two strongly related assets converge in price, selling the one they consider pricey, buying the other, profiting off the difference.
Their job is a little complicated with these futures. Bitcoin’s wild volatility makes it harder to predict where the most-active contract, which expires in January, will settle, Tilly added. Only a few thousand contracts have traded so far, perhaps not enough to exert much influence on the cryptocurrency. And some investors might be willing to pay a premium for futures on a regulated market instead of going to the trouble of creating accounts at bitcoin exchanges, which have been repeatedly hacked with millions of dollars worth of tokens stolen.
“People feel a lot more comfortable in the futures on the Cboe than on an unregulated exchange,” said Kevin Kelly, managing partner of Benchmark Investments, which analyzes futures markets to develop indexes. 
Then there’s the fact that when the Cboe contracts expire, buyers get cash, not bitcoin itself. When a derivative is cash-settled, that tends to weaken links to an underlying asset.
“If you’re doing a cash-settled future, it’s just a bet,” said Aaron Brown, a former managing director at quant hedge fund AQR Capital Management who invests in the cryptocurrency and writes for Bloomberg Prophets. “If that’s not related to any underlying physical transaction, the only people who want to do it are gamblers.” The wide arb spread is “a big issue. It’s an illiquidity, it has to go away.” 
Soon, Cboe won’t be the sole regulated exchange offering bitcoin futures. Rival CME Group Inc. will launch its own contracts on Dec. 18. And Nasdaq Inc. is planning to bring a competing product to market next year, Bloomberg News recently 
. 
The price gap between bitcoin and bitcoin futures won’t last forever, said Dave Weisberger, CEO of CoinRoutes, a cryptocurrency data and order routing company.
“The futures will ping-pong between premium and discount,” he said. “I suspect at some point, potentially triggered by a negative event, it will flip. Markets go up and down, and bitcoin has been no different. It’s just been fast.”

=== Title: Goldman Wants a 100% Margin on Some Bitcoin Futures Trades - Bloomberg ===

 demanded some clients set aside funds equal to the full value of their bitcoin futures trade as a condition for clearing the transaction, according to people familiar with the investments.
The demands deterred some customers from seeking to clear trades through the bank and led them to take their business elsewhere, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the matter. The guidelines are inclusive of other margin requirements such as Options Clearing Corp.’s 44 percent, required to clear contracts traded on the Cboe Global Markets Inc., and the 47 percent to be demanded by CME Group Inc. when it begins trading bitcoin futures next week.
“Margin decisions are based on multiple factors and vary on a case-by-case basis,” Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said Thursday in a statement. 
The bank is one of a handful that have cleared the trades since the Cboe began offering futures contracts earlier this week. Bitcoin’s volatility spurred many large banks to hold off on clearing trades. Options Clearing and CME raised their margin requirements amid wild 
 in the market.
It’s not uncommon for a brokerage to impose steeper requirements than the exchange. Interactive Brokers Group Inc., which has said it handled 53 percent of the first day’s trading in Cboe’s bitcoin futures, will require a margin of 50 percent for long investments, and about 240 percent for short selling, based on current rates, according to Interactive spokeswoman Kalen Holliday.
A 
 is how much investors must set aside so that other parties in the trade know any losses can be covered. The guidelines for bitcoin futures are several times that of commodities such as gold and oil.

=== Title: Uber Fires More Than 20 Employees in Harassment Probe - Bloomberg ===

The housecleaning at 
 is just getting under way.
Uber fired more than 20 people after a company-wide investigation into harassment claims and hired at least two high-profile senior executives whose job will be to set strategy and rethink branding.
Law firm 
led the investigation, reviewing 215 human-resources claims; while it took no action in 100 instances, it’s still probing 57 others. There’s also a separate investigation commissioned by Uber that’s being led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. That group shared detailed findings with a subcommittee of Uber’s board of directors, but a summary isn’t expected to be made public until next week, a person familiar with the matter said.  Uber also plans to take action on some of the report’s findings next week, the person said.
“They’re showing that they’re going to take some concrete steps to address the matter,” said Evan Rawley, a professor at Columbia University’s business school. “This issue is going to keep being at the forefront until the investigation is completed.”
Uber is awash in 
 after former engineering employee Susan Fowler published a blog post alleging that she was sexually harassed and that the case was mishandled by human resources and senior management. Uber’s woes don’t end there. It’s also suffered a flurry of departures by senior executives, including heads of finance, growth, engineering and policy and communications. Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick -- who himself has made a series of public relations blunders, including being 
 arguing with an Uber driver -- has conceded he needs leadership help and hired a search firm to find a chief operating officer.
Bobbie Wilson, an attorney at Perkins Coie, gave Uber’s more than 12,000 employees an assessment of the firm’s investigation on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the issue. Some of the people fired were senior executives, according to the person, who asked not to be identified discussing personnel matters. The company didn’t name the employees who were let go.
Aside from those fired, 31 employees are in counseling or training, while seven received written warnings from the company, an Uber spokesman said. The issues deal with harassment, discrimination, retaliation and other HR matters.
Kalanick has taken other steps to clean up Uber’s image. He asked for the 
 of Amit Singhal, his new head of software engineering, after the company learned of a sexual harassment claim at his former employer, Google. Singhal, who left in late February, denied the allegation.
In the wake of complaints and the leadership void, Uber 
 two women as senior executives -- former 
 executive Bozoma Saint John as chief brand officer and Harvard Business School Professor Frances Frei as senior vice present for leadership and strategy.
Saint John rose to prominence last year at Apple’s annual developer conference, where she 
 a revised version of the company’s music streaming service designed to make it easier to use. She told Business Insider that her role at Uber will be to burnish the company’s brand and make it more like Apple’s. “It’s grown so quickly in such a short amount of time -- and leadership and others have been so focused on growing the business -- that this very moment is about changing the image of Uber and crafting what that brand story is,” Saint John told the website. “That hasn’t been done yet.” Saint John will be Uber’s highest ranking black executive.
Saint John joined Apple in April 2014 as head of global consumer marketing for iTunes and Beats Music. She previously worked as the head of music and entertainment marketing for 
For her part, Frei told Recode that her “goal is to make this a world-class company that can be proud of itself in the end, rather than embarrassed.” Frei is the author of the book “Uncommon Service: How to Win By Putting Customers at the Core of Your Business,” and plans to commute from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to San Francisco.

=== Title: Why Haven’t You Heard of This Artist That Investors Love? - Bloomberg ===

The German-born, New York based painter Michael Krebber is supported by a dream team of dealers and collectors.
His work, which toys with art history by challenging perceptions of what a painting can look like (he’s painted text from webpages, made paintings that appear to be doodles, or unfinished), is represented by a list of galleries that reads like an 
 
 checklist: 
 in New York, 
 in Paris, 
 in Brussels, 
 
, which has locations in Berlin, Cologne, and New York, and 
 in London. 
His collector base, meanwhile, is prestigious, discreet, and fervent: “I find the group of collectors who buy his work are incredibly devoted,” says the adviser Eleanor Cayre, who collects Krebber’s art. “This group only seems to be getting larger and larger, particularly now as we’re seeing many museums and institutions joining the fray.”
Despite that pedigree, Krebber has remained surprisingly under-the-radar, a virtual unknown to those in the broader art world, let alone the mainstream public.
“He’s a significant artist, and he falls into a category that’s typically called “painters’ painters,” says art adviser Allan Schwartzman, who’s placed Krebber’s art with numerous clients. “That means a painter who’s revered by other painters but barely known to collectors.”
There are signs that this is about to change. This year, a significant exhibition of Krebber’s work traveled from the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art in Porto, Portugal, to the Kunsthalle Bern in Switzerland. A catalogue raisonné, which is a compilation of every work the artist has ever made, is currently in the works.
Most telling, after a sluggish couple of decades on the auction market, Krebber’s art—while still comparatively affordable compared to his peers’ million-dollar results—is beginning to inch upwards in price. (Currently, you can buy a painting of his for the tens of thousands and a drawing for under $10,000.)
“At the end of the day, show me a painter who’s been working for 30 years—and has been as influential as Krebber—that you can buy for less than $100,000,” says Pierre Orlowski, a London-based dealer and collector. “In 10 years, you’ll see Krebber selling for a million dollars.”
That prediction will hinge on whether the artist—even his strongest supporters acknowledge that he makes “difficult” art—can reach and connect with a broader audience. 
“Ultimately, what takes an artist to the next level is the integrity and presence of the art they make,” says the dealer Carol Greene of Greene Naftali, whose gallery sold a work by Krebber for around $100,000 at Art Basel in Miami Beach earlier this month. 
Krebber, who was born in Cologne, Germany, in 1954, studied painting at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Karslruhe, Germany. He was an assistant in the studios of superstar German artists Martin Kippenberger and Georg Baselitz. (Krebber’s supporters often point to these affiliations, both as proof of his pedigree and to underscore the dramatic difference in their and Krebber’s prices.)
But unlike the aforementioned German painters, Krebber’s paintings and drawings are often minimal and occasionally inscrutable. A recent series that’s become highly sought-after is his so-called “Snail” set of paintings, which sometimes consist of only one line. Other series have the uncanny feel of (very) unfinished abstract paintings.
That’s the point though, says Greene. “For Krebber, painting is a performance,” she says. “It’s incredibly risky to put two marks of paint on a canvas and call it a painting.” What some might perceive as hard to understand, she continues, is in fact the product of careful and deliberate choices by the artist. “There’s something to be said for humility,” she says. “And withholding marks, that conveys a different kind of experience.”
“He’s a painter that’s succeeded with making the most with the least,” says Orlowski. “He’s created this unfinished aesthetic.”
Starting in 2002, Krebber became a teacher at Frankfurt’s Städelschule (he left the position in 2016, when he moved to New York), in the process influencing a group of younger artists who have become, over time, devotees.
“When we did our last show of his work, a bunch of students took an eight-hour train from Germany to the opening,” says Thomas Arsac, a director at Chantal Crousel. “They literally didn’t have enough money to rent a room for the night, so they came to the opening, came to the dinner—because Krebber invited them—and then they went home.”
That level of devotion is another thing dealers can point to as proof of Krebber’s significance: “It’s important to underscore how much Krebber is a key figure of the art world,” says Ayelet Yanai, a partner at Dépendance gallery. “He’s influenced a lot of the young artists of today.”
Influential as he might be, Krebber’s market, at least until recently, was a slow burn. His first painting to come to auction, according to Artnet, was 
painted around 1992-1993. It came up to the block at Christie’s South Kensington in 1999 with an estimate of $2,000 to $3,000 and failed to find a buyer, as did a second work from the series that came up the the same day. 
It took an additional decade for his next work to appear, when a watercolor sold at a small Swiss auction house for less than a thousand dollars. It wasn’t until 2012, when an untitled black-and-white painting sold for $10,181 at the Parisian auction house Artcurial, that one of Krebber’s works publicly broke the $10,000 mark.
His primary market was similarly sedate, mirroring, more or less, the auction market. But in the last five years, dealers say, things have begun to pick up. Paintings began popping up at auction and selling, with some regularity, well above estimate. 
A 2014 sale at Christie’s New York saw a painting soar above its high estimate of $9,000 and sell for $52,500; the next year, a painting executed in 2000 had a high estimate of $40,000 and sold for $100,000; and the year after that, in 2016, a painting from 1997 carrying a high estimate of $112,000 sold for $237,296 at Sotheby’s in London.
On the primary market, dealers say, his work has been on a similar upward trend. Today, his drawings sell for $7,500, says Greene, and paintings range from $40,000 up to $250,000 for multi-panel paintings and installations. Orlowski says he’s sold Krebber paintings privately for $300,000.
The question, then, is what it will take to push those numbers even higher. Orlowski says that when the catalogue raisonné publishes it will “change the market.”  The market of an artist, he says “is driven by masterpieces, and people don't realize yet how many masterpieces Krebber has made.”
Schwartzman has a more measured outlook. “He has all the signifiers of someone who’s undervalued,” he says. “But does it take one year for it to happen, or 15? I don’t know.”
 

=== Title: How Requiring Bar Exams Cuts Into Workforce Mobility: Eco Pulse - Bloomberg ===

As licensing requirements become more common in the U.S. workforce, they’re driving down migration between states, curbing labor market flexibility. 
That’s the conclusion of a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, and it’s the lead item in this week’s economic research roundup. We also take a look at the family characteristics that come alongside childhood obesity, at how finance effects the economy, and at the possible savings impact of tax cuts. Check this column each week for a survey of fresh studies from academia, agencies, think tanks and Wall Street. 
Between-state migration has fallen off a cliff in the U.S., and an uptick in occupational licensing is one culprit driving the trend, according to this working paper by the University of Minnesota’s Janna Johnson and Morris Kleiner. Between-state migration for individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to members of other occupations, based the analysis. Even after accounting for the fact that state-licensed professionals may have clientele and network-based reasons for seeking stability, the relative migration of state-licensed occupations is 16 percent lower than for those that require a national test. 
The overall effect could be significant. The increase in licensing could account for 4 percent of the decline in interstate migration between 1980 and 2010, which is significant when one considers that the aging of the U.S. population accounted for only 10 percent of the decline in that period. The effects of licensing are especially clear in the legal field, which requires bar exams. Increasing bar exam difficulty cuts both in-migration and out-migration: lawyers don’t want to take the test, and don’t want to give it up once they have. A lot of this result is driven by California, where the bar is notoriously difficult. 
Children from households where at least one sibling is obese tend to live in a more disadvantaged environment. Their parents were more likely to be unmarried, less educated, unemployed, and obese themselves, based on a U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service analysis.  
Finance is good for economic growth, a vast body of research shows, but recent studies suggest that its effects are not monolithic: benefits don’t arise from all types of financial activity and at all levels of financial development. “The positive effect of finance on growth dissipates beyond a threshold level of financial development,” according to a European Central Bank review of more recent literature. Why? Part of it owes to brain-drain from the real economy to the financial sector, and part to the exacerbation of fragility as finance becomes more important in an economy. It’s also the case that some types of finance, like mortgage credit, have proven less useful for sustainable economic development than, for instance, enterprise credit. 
The savings rate has been falling in the U.S. over the past two years as consumers spend more on services, but Bank of America Corp. economists suggest that the trend could see a temporary turnaround if tax cuts come to fruition. Because the potential personal tax cuts are written into law as temporary, theoretical evidence suggests that they’ll lead to a tick-up in savings – if they were lasting, households might view them as a sign that they’d need less money in the future. Because they are not, the effect doesn’t hold. Theory seems to match up with evidence, in this case. Under the 2001 U.S. tax cuts, rebates seem to have increased the savings rate.

=== Title: Investors Told to Brace for Steepest Rate Hikes Since 2006 - Bloomberg ===

Wall Street economists are telling investors to brace for the biggest tightening of monetary policy in more than a decade.
With the world economy heading into its strongest period since 2011, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. predict average interest rates across advanced economies will climb to at least 1 percent next year in what would be the largest increase since 2006.
As for the quantitative easing that marks its 10th anniversary in the U.S. next year, Bloomberg Economics predicts net asset purchases by the main central banks will fall to a monthly $18 billion at the end of 2018, from $126 billion in September, and turn negative during the first half of 2019.
That reflects an increasingly synchronized global expansion finally strong enough to spur inflation, albeit modestly. The test for policy makers, including incoming Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, will be whether they can continue pulling back without derailing demand or rocking asset markets.
“2018 is the year when we have true tightening,” said Ebrahim Rahbari, director of global economics at Citigroup in New York. “We will continue on the current path where financial markets can deal quite well with monetary policy but perhaps later in the year, or in 2019, monetary policy will become one of the complicating factors.”
A clearer picture should form this week when the Norges Bank, Fed, 
, 
 and 
 announce their final policy decisions of 2017. They collectively set borrowing costs for more than a third of the world economy. At least 10 other central banks also deliver decisions this week.
The Fed will dominate the headlines on Wednesday amid predictions it will raise its benchmark by a quarter of a percentage point. Outgoing chair Janet Yellen is set to signal more increases to come in 2018. On Thursday, the SNB, BOE and ECB will make decisions in quick succession although each is forecast to keep rates on hold.
There will likely be more activity next year as Citigroup estimates the advanced world’s average rate will reach its highest since 2008, climbing 0.4 percentage point to 1 percent. JPMorgan projects its gauge to rise to 1.2 percent, a jump of more than half a percentage point from 0.68 percent at the end of this year.
Citigroup expects the Fed and its Canadian peer to move three times and the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Norway once. JPMorgan is forecasting the U.S. will shift four times. The latest 
 also showed three Fed hikes in 2018, but moved forward one of them to March from June.
Behind the shift are expectations that the world economy will expand around 4 percent next year, the best since a post-recession bounce in 2011. Among the accelerators: falling unemployment, stronger trade and business spending, as well as a likely tax cut in the U.S.
The International Monetary Fund predicts consumer prices in advanced economies will climb 1.7 percent next year, the most since 2012, although it remains below the 2 percent most central banks view as price stability.
The global tightening will still leave rates low by historical standards and central banks may ultimately hold fire if inflation stays weak. Neither the ECB nor the BOJ are currently expected to lift their benchmarks next year.
Past and ongoing bond buying will cushion the withdrawal of stimulus elsewhere, as will easing by some emerging market central banks. Russia and Colombia may this week follow Brazil in cutting their benchmarks.
While BOE Governor Mark Carney and ECB President Mario Draghi pivoted away from easy money without roiling financial markets, the calm may not last. The Bank for International Settlements warned this month that policy makers risk lulling investors into a false sense of security that elevates the risk of a correction in bond yields.
Investors are already less bullish than most economists. In the U.S., where inflation has shown some signs of slowing, the market sees about two quarter-point hikes next year, according to federal funds futures contracts. There is also speculation the bond yield curve may even invert as long-term borrowing costs fall below short-term ones, a trade which sometimes foreshadows a recession.
Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, is betting that “quantitative tightening” will hit markets in the second quarter. That’s when he assumes U.S. inflation takes off and the ECB signals an end to bond buying.
“We see 2018 as a pretty key year for normalization,” said Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec in London. “It’s going to be quite challenging for central banks to get the balance right on how much to do.”

 will let its brokerage clients trade bitcoin futures starting on Monday, a week after they debuted.
Customers will gain access to the contracts offered by Cboe Global Markets Inc. To trade, they must have a minimum account balance of $25,000 and post margin -- or collateral -- that’s one and a half times higher than Cboe requires, according to a statement emailed Friday.
CME Group Inc. is introducing its own bitcoin futures on Dec. 17, but TD Ameritrade customers won’t immediately be able to trade those, the company said.
“Right now we are taking the same approach we did with the Cboe product, to wait and see how it goes,” said JB Mackenzie, managing director for futures trading at TD Ameritrade. “We want to watch that market open and become an orderly marketplace and see who the participants are in that marketplace. This is the same process we use with any new product. We want to see how the market reacts.”

=== Title: First Porsche, Now Lamborghini Adds a Luxury SUV in Its Range - Bloomberg ===

Lamborghini is unveiling a high-performance crossover that could double the size of the brand as the Italian manufacturer enters an increasingly crowded segment that’s attracting 
, 
 and 
’s Rolls-Royce.
Lamborghini’s Urus and other hulking sports utility vehicles from racing icons like Ferrari might send shivers down the spines of die-hard sportscar aficionados, but shareholders tend to benefit. Global demand for two-seater supercars is stalling, and even the top-end of the segment is succumbing to the broad customer shift toward more-rugged vehicles. The move is particularly pronounced in emerging markets vital for growth.
“Lamborghini is a hidden gem, and adding the Urus SUV will propel volume closer to Italian rival Ferrari,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michael Dean said in a note on Friday. Assuming a 175,000-euro ($207,000) selling price, the model could lift the brand’s earnings by more than 50 percent in 2019, he said.
Seeing limited appeal for Lamborghini Huracans and Aventadors in markets like China and Russia, German parent 
pushed to expand the lineup with a model capable of taking on trickier road conditions. Lamborghini last year sold only 188 cars in the world’s largest auto market, China, compared with 303 in the U.K., a market that’s 90 percent smaller.
The Urus will be Lamborghini’s first SUV since production of the LM002 -- the so-called Rambo Lambo -- ended in 1993. It had unveiled a prototype five years ago. Lamborghini officials have said there’s potential to sell at least 4,000 performance crossovers a year, which would more than double sales. They also indicated a partly battery-powered hybrid variant of the vehicle could be offered.

=== Title: Seven Ways Hotels Will Change in 2018 - Bloomberg ===

In response to the many geo-political, sociological, and technological changes that took place in 2017, five-star hotels are making changes—some small, some large. Here’s what to expect, based on predictions from a panel of leading industry insiders: Tina Edmundson, global brand officer at 
; Bjorn Hanson, clinical professor at NYU’s Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism; John Vanderslice, global head of luxury and lifestyle brands at 
; and Guy Langford and Marcello Gasdia, of Deloitte LLP’s travel, hospitality, and services group.
 
Hotels in major U.S. markets will become more expensive next year as the practice of adding resort fees, once reserved for getaways in exotic locales, becomes more and more common at urban properties—often with a nightly price tag of $25. NYU’s Hanson has noticed them most in New York, where high occupancy rates leave picky travelers with few alternatives. (They’re also rumored to be popping up in Chicago and Los Angeles.) Budget for the fee on business trips, as transparency is not yet what it should be. There is one slight silver lining: “This is better than hotels raising their room rates,” says Hanson, “since the fees aren’t subject to occupancy taxes.”
 
Enjoy those chocolates on your pillow, while you still can. “More and more hotels are making turndown service optional for two reasons. One is cost,” says NYU’s Hanson. The second, he says, is privacy. “We go through cycles when people are more private and more open, and right now—for reasons I can only speculate about—people are feeling more private about their personal space. Some people don’t like their toiletries straightened up.”
“It’s a fair comment” says Deloitte’s Langford. “My personal view is that there are things you value and things you don’t, and I don’t need anyone to turn down my bed. With certain companies, it may be part of a brand promise. But if it’s not, it’s a cost—and it doesn’t need to be provided.”
 
“Technology is top of mind for everyone right now,” says Marriott’s Edmundson—who oversees 
, including Ritz-Carlton, Edition, Luxury Collection, and St. Regis—specifically investment in the so-called “Internet of Things” (IoT) tech such as Nest temperature control units or Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa.
Marriott’s experimental “Internet of Things room,” created 
, includes showers that remember a guest’s preferred temperature, digital wall art that can be swapped for family photos, and mirrors with embedded displays—for on-demand yoga videos. The rooms will soft-launch in 2018; W hotels will likely be first to offer them.
Vanderslice may get there sooner. Hilton 
 a similarly teched-out room with mobile app controls for television, lighting, thermostat, and digital art. It will debut in major cities in the coming weeks, with a rapid rollout across all Hilton brands in 2018 and 2019. 
“2018 is going to be the year that the rubber hits the road with IoT technology,” says Deloitte’s Gasdia. “It took a while for this technology to mature, but now personalization can happen in real time. It’s a win-win for everybody.”
 
While lifestyle brands, such as Ace and 1 Hotels, have upended the old-fashioned lobby and turned it into a cool, collective workspace, luxury brands have largely stayed true to tradition. That will be challenged in 2018, says Hanson, who predicts that the check-in desk will slowly fade into oblivion, reflecting travelers’ shifting preferences for intimacy rather than formality. 
“Fifty years ago, people didn’t have credit cards, and bad guys would come jump the desk and steal the cash,” he begins. “But that’s not the case anymore, and hotels no longer need that type of tall, wide barrier. Now they’re thinking: ‘Why can’t we have a little seating area that’s very comfortable and intimate?’”
Living room-like check-in areas are indeed popping up at some of the world’s finest properties. Take the 
 in Paris, recently reopened after a four-year makeover by Rosewood. Its reception space is an elegant sitting room, with antique desks and a plush loveseat. The shift allows travelers to relax after a long journey—something Deloitte pinpointed as a key need, especially for business travelers, in its recent “Hotel of the Future”
study.
When the Eaton Workshop opens in Washington early next year, it will be 
. The company may be onto something. “Luxury customers are drawn to brands that communicate a sense of purpose—beyond just existing to sell something,” says Marriott’s Edmundson, pointing to “sky-high” engagement at two W hotel speaker series, “What She Said" and “Queer Me Out,” showcasing powerful women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ) thought leaders, respectively.
But it’s not in every brand’s DNA to plant such politically charged flags, so in 2018, top-tier brands will find softer ways to appeal to consumers’ values—being careful not to alienate any potential guests.
“Forty percent of guests will fall on one political extreme, and 40 will fall on the other,” says NYU’s Hanson. “Few are in the middle. But there are causes that nobody could disagree with, like human trafficking, 40 percent of which occurs in hotels,” he adds. “Nobody would be offended by a company taking a stand on that.”
 
“Wellness is going to be the next trillion-dollar industry,” predicts Deloitte’s Langford. “Everyone wants to capitalize on the huge swell, but 
. Nobody has figured it out yet.”
Already, Hyatt has bought legendary wellness brand Miraval 
, while JW Marriott has partnered with the Joffrey Ballet for on-demand barre classes. Meanwhile, Four Seasons has developed wellness rooms with de-chlorinating showers and Deepak Chopra meditation videos.
“At the bleeding edge, wellness resorts are changing their talent strategies, hiring more doctors, more NPs, more nutritionists—and that’s really expensive,” says Delotte’s Gasdia. “But they’re doing really well with revenue and gross bookings.” Hanson agrees: “With even select-service brands upgrading their fitness centers, this is a place where luxury brands have the physical space to stay ahead of the curve.”
Based on a recent survey of 5,000 Marriott guests, Edmundson says that “about 80 percent of respondents agreed that improving their physical 
 emotional well-being is more of a focus for them today than it was three years ago—sleep improvement, new diets, and meditation all scored high in terms of what travelers had participated in over the past 12 months.” Not coincidentally, her eight brands will “lean into this space” in 2018, with JW Marriott taking the leading role.  
 
The business of running a hotel company can no longer be boxed into four walls. “These days, we think of ourselves as being more in the travel business than the hotel business,” says Marriott’s Edmundson, who is overseeing the launch of 
 in the next two years.
“In every single sector, including travel, it’s all about ecosystems,” says Deloitte’s Gasdia. “Think about 
. It’s all about leveraging the power of adjacent spaces.” So what does that mean for travelers? Most notably, hotels will now attempt to fill up their itineraries with experiences and activities.
“The tours-and-activities space is going through a huge coming of digital age,” explains Gasdia—and hotels want to cash in. (
) Take Marriott’s 
, which unlocks 100,000 walking tours, biking excursions, and culinary classes in 800 destinations around the world. Or the new “Live Unforgettable” campaign for Waldorf Astoria; Hilton’s Vanderslice says it will link hotel guests with such celebrities as Gabrielle Union at high-profile dinner events.
NYU’s Hanson argues that selling activities is crucial for luxury hotels. It helps them control the end-to-end shopping experience, offers data that can feed guest personalization, and distinguishes high-end properties from mid-tier ones.
“Luxury hotels need to do more. We get ironing boards and bathrobes everywhere, don’t need business centers, and even the concierge has become irrelevant,” he explains. Experiences, though, are a winnable space. “Local walking tours, comped theater tickets, exhibits in the hotels, manager receptions for frequent guests—these are the types of things that only luxury hotels can do.”

=== Title: All You Need to Know About Bitcoin’s Rise, From $0.01 to $15,000 - Bloomberg ===

The initial price of bitcoin, set in 2010, was less than 1 cent. Now it’s 
 $16,000. Once seen as the province of nerds, libertarians and drug dealers, bitcoin today is drawing millions of dollars from hedge funds. The recent price surge may be a bubble. Or it could be a belated recognition by the broader financial community that so-called cryptocurrencies -- digital forms of money -- are going mainstream. It 
to nail down what a bitcoin is, and why its price has been going through the roof.
It’s a form of money that’s remarkable for what it’s not: It’s not currency you can hold in your hand. It’s not recognized by most Main Street stores. It’s not issued or backed by a national government. At their core, bitcoin and its imitators are sets of 
 for generating digital tokens and for tracking transactions in a way that makes it hard to counterfeit or re-use tokens. A bitcoin has value only to the extent that its users agree that it does.
The original software was laid out in a 
 in 2008 by a person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identify remains unknown, despite several efforts to assign or claim 
. Online fantasy games had long used virtual currencies. The key idea behind bitcoin was the 
 -- a publicly visible, largely anonymous online ledger that records bitcoin transactions.
Think about what happens if you make an online transfer using a bank. It verifies that you have the funds, subtracts that amount from one spot in a giant database it maintains of accounts and balances, and credits it in another. You can see the result if you log on to your account but the transaction is under the bank’s control. You’re trusting the bank to remove the right amount of money, and the bank is also making sure you can’t spend that money again. The blockchain is a database that performs those tracking functions -- but without the bank or any other central authority.
It’s done by consensus on a decentralized network. Bitcoin transactions can be made through sites offering electronic 
 that upload the data to the network. New transactions are bundled together into a batch and broadcast to the network for verification by so-called bitcoin miners.
Anybody, so long as you have really fast computers, a 
 and a desire to solve puzzles. The transaction data in each batch is encrypted by a formula that can be unlocked only through trial-and-error guessing on a massive scale. The miners put large-scale computing power to work as they compete to be the first 
. If a miner’s answer is verified by others, the data is added to a linked chain of blocks of data and the miner is rewarded with newly issued bitcoin.
Because every block contains data linking to earlier blocks, an attempt to spend the same bitcoin twice would mean revising many links in the chain. Plus, as miners compete, they

Bitcoin’s reputation has improved, partly because there are fewer large-scale thefts like the one in 2014 in which bitcoins

Enthusiasts see it as a new way of doing all sorts of business. Costs could be lower without a central middleman doing the work of keeping track of transactions, and charging for it. Banks and stock exchanges have invested heavily in developing blockchain technology, while retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are experimenting with using blockchain for

 about issuing blockchain-based official currencies. And other forms of blockchain emerged, often using their own cryptocurrencies to facilitate transactions. The most prominent is the 
 blockchain, sometimes described as a platform for so-called smart contracts.
As the number of cryptocurrencies and tokens

Fund manager Mike Novogratz calls cryptocurrencies “the biggest bubble of our lifetimes,” and yet he is starting a $500 million fund to invest in them.

=== Title: This Bartending Legend Wants You to Drink Less - Bloomberg ===

In the mid-aughts, America was on the tail end of its obsession with the Cosmopolitan and on the cusp of a classic cocktail renaissance. The country was reacquainting itself with the gin martini and the Old-Fashioned, drinks in heavy rotation on the hit TV series 
, which premiered in 2007.
That same year, I opened a speak-easy-style bar in the East Village called PDT (short for “Please Don’t Tell”). And then the global financial markets crashed. As the glut of capital that fueled sprawling clubs and lavish restaurants in Manhattan dried up, customers’ focus shifted from decadent décor to the quality of what was on their plates and in their glasses.
Looking back, PDT’s early success was surely due in part to the crisis, as New Yorkers sought more intimate spaces to ride out the recession. In turbulent times, people also tend to drink to calm their nerves. (Much as they do during the holidays.) The problem is that even after the markets rebounded, 
. About 12.6 percent of adults reported “high-risk” drinking in 2012 and 2013, compared with 9.7 percent in 2001 and 2002, according to a study in 
.
As the shelves at cocktail bars and liquor shops get more crowded, what’s been lost is the idea of moderation that, ironically, brought many of these places and drinks back into fashion. People couldn’t afford to overindulge in $12 cocktails every night of the week in 2007. But having spent the past 15 years bartending and trying to establish drinks’ position among the high culinary arts, I’ve come to accept the hard truth that they should serve a role similar to pastries: a delight more than a nourishment. Imagine dining at a restaurant renowned for its desserts. You don’t order three of them.
One big issue is 
 we’re drinking. As the country rediscovered classic cocktails, alcohol itself got stronger. Today, cask-strength bourbons and Scotches (around 125 proof), navy-strength gins and rums (around 114 proof), and mezcal straight off the still (around 100 proof) are all the rage. And that’s when we’re not drinking heady wines that commonly come in at 17 percent alcohol by volume, or double IPAs.
Once we went to high-proof Flavortown—a term coined by Jack Daniel’s-swilling TV chef Guy Fieri—many imbibers decided they didn’t want to leave. After years of chugging light beer six-packs or saccharine Alabama Slammers, drinkers began putting complex, boozy cocktails such as the Negroni on a pedestal.
People assume that overindulgence is good for me as a bar operator. That’s not true. My primary responsibility is to look after the well-being of my guests. On behalf of the ones who suffer the next day and into the future, as well as guests affected in real time by the behavior of nearby out-of-control drinkers, I’m alarmed at the amount some of my customers consume.
I’m not saying alcohol is bad for you. I love the character of the cocktails, beer, and wine I serve, along with their palliative effect as a social lubricant. Yet I’m astonished to see cocktail bars—which were once civilized escapes from noisy dives and clubs—start to resemble the vulgar venues they originally positioned themselves against.
And that doesn’t even take into account the sugar in our drinks: That ounce of Campari and sweet vermouth in a Negroni is just as deleterious to your health as the high alcohol content of the gin that mitigates the sweetness. Then there are the effects of alcohol itself; you won’t find a study that advocates for anything more than moderate drinking.
I know that in these roller-coaster times, it’s easy to feel out of control. The stock market might be surging, but it’s an anxiety-provoking ride. And paying attention to daily politics is a white-knuckle endeavor. But for those exact reasons, now is a time for vigilance and poise.
The moral of my story isn’t that you should never drink alcohol. The widespread availability of high-quality spirits, and cocktails served by passionate professionals, makes this one of history’s most exciting times to drink. Just do it a little less. Seek out drinks prepared with top-notch liquor and have two instead of five. When you return to the bar, help us out and bring someone who’s never tried a great cocktail and share the craft. Instead of the troubling binge-drinking trends we’re seeing today, I’d love to see more people respect alcohol as the rare treat it is. Now that would be icing on the cake.

=== Title: How Koenigsegg Broke the Land Speed Record With Its Agera RS - Bloomberg ===

This month a Koenigsegg Agera RS hit the highest speed ever for a production vehicle.
Driver Niklas Lilja averaged a top speed of 277.87 mph across two runs in the $2 million coupe on a 11-mile, closed-off stretch of Highway 160 near 
. 
That beat the previous record of 267.8 mph set by a Bugatti Veyron Super Sports model seven years ago in Germany. It also beat the Hennessey Venom GT and McLaren F1 that had previously owned or approximated similar top speeds.  
What’s more, Lilja set records for highest speed in a single direction on a public road (284.55 mph); a zero-400-zero km/h run (33.29 seconds); the highest average speed for a mile with a flying start on a public road (276.36 mph); and the highest average speed for a flying kilometer on a public road (276.9 mph).
The two latter records had been unbeaten since 1938. Nazi engineers set them with a modified Mercedes W125 race car along a section of the German autobahn. It was overdue for a topple.
Indeed. While the auto and technology industries have garnered plenty of hype for self-driving and autonomous cars—appliances, really—the field of drivable, high-powered super cars has never been more exciting. 
The Koenigsegg Agera RS that set the record had a 1,360-horsepower, twin-turbocharged V8 engine and a power-to-weight ratio near that of the famous Koenigsegg One:1 (so-named for its perfect 1:1 ratio). It also weighed just 1395 kg (3,075 pounds), not including the factory-installed roll-cage used while completing the records. That sounds heavy, but it’s more than 1,000 pounds lighter than the 4,162-pound Bugatti that previously held the speed record and roughly 200-hp more powerful—two considerable factors.
But it was also adjusted for downforce, Koenigsegg spokesman Steven Wade said on a phone call from the factory in Sweden. (Downforce is important for keeping a car stable as it accelerates and moves through space at high speed.) That proved the key factor to making the Agera RS faster than the more powerful, more expensive, more insane One:1. Where the One:1 was aerodynamically calibrated specifically to handle the curves of a track—the shape of its front splitter, rear wing, and air vents all direct the flow of air in the way that eases changes in direction and speed—Koenigsegg calibrated the Agera RS to optimize movement in a straight line.
“Agera doesn’t quite have the same quite dramatic aerodynamics [as the One:1], which it means it has less drag,” Wade said. “With less drag, you’re able to cut through the air quicker; with slightly less downforce, it’s better suited to a top speed, so this car was almost always a better candidate for a top speed record.”
The other main factors that allowed the Agera RS to excel in Nevada are much more mundane: tires and logistics.
After all, the Agera RS has been available since 2015. The car that set the record is a true production vehicle, so in theory Koenigsegg could have set the record back then. But it was only within the past six months that Michelin began working directly with Koenigsegg to go for a moon shot.
“Tires are critical when you’re talking about a high-speed run like this—they are the potential weak link,” Wade said. “If anything should go wrong with a tire, you’ve got a potentially fatal situation, to be honest.”
For instance, that tiny valve stem where you put air into the tires on your 911 weighs 30 grams when you hold it in your hand. That’s about equal to a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses. But when it’s rotating at 450 km/hour, it weighs closer to 170 kilograms, or 375 pounds, he said. That’s enough to affect the handling of the car or do serious damage as a flying object should anything go wrong.  
“It’s the centrifugal force,” Wade said. “So we had to rotate a wheel with that part in to make sure it would hold up. This hadn’t been done before, so we had to make sure. Luckily, it passed with flying colors.”
The deeper challenge was to mitigate heat, tire pressure, and wear at speeds faster than some airplanes travel at takeoff. For the Koenigsegg run, Michelin conducted the testing sessions at an aircraft testing facility in Michigan. Where some tires may have been able to sustain a high speed for a few seconds, these tires needed to be able to repeatedly withstand high speeds for minutes at a time.
“When you’re traveling at 250 mph, you’ve got to control for the growth of the tire,” Schmedding said. Heat and centrifugal force are the issue. “I kept checking everything run after run, and it all looked great. We felt comfortable. I just said, ‘Let’s keep going.’”
It’s no accident that the 
 that just broke the Nurburgring record also used stock Michelin tires—the company outfits most of the automakers competing in this rarefied air, although it uses strictly different tires for each brand and don’t share data between brands, Schmedding said.
Each of the four Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires used for the Koenigsegg record run consisted of a proprietary mix of rubber, thread compounds, steel bands, and filaments with Kevlar-style cords inside that allowed engineers to regulate the tension of each tire as it achieved top speed. They were also made without the seams in the rubber that “normal” tires have, which can create heavy spots in the tire when run at high speeds.
As with every other component of the record-setting car—the aspect that makes it so exciting to driving enthusiasts everywhere—the tires are available for sale to anyone who can afford their retail price of $300 to $400 per tire.
Clothing retailer Mark Stidham could afford the tires along with the car. It was his idea to go for the record (talk about bragging rights), and he was the first Agera RS owner to make his own car available for the attempt. Koenigsegg needed the support: There’s a three- to four-year waiting list for people who have already paid to buy Koenigsegg’s current car, the Regara; each of the 80 to be made were assigned to buyers long ago. As for the Agera RS, the brand will make only 25, plus three final edition cars.
“We only build cars for customers,” Wade said. “We did have plans to build an RS for ourselves, but we had sold the entire allocation that we were going to build, so we didn’t even have a demonstrator.”
It helped that Stidham reportedly has friends in the film industry. Those guys know how to shut down entire stretches of highway, a feat that takes no small effort to work through paperwork, permits, transport, fees, and scheduling. One of the reasons that 80-year-old flying-kilometer record stood for so long was simply that no one had taken the time to beat it.
Not that the challenge will keep Bugatti away. Or Hennessey, for that matter. Not by a long shot.
In a written statement, the Volkswagen-owned company said it “congratulates Koenigsegg on this achievement” and is “pleased to see that several super sports car manufacturers have entered the competition for records in the high speed range.”
“As announced at the Frankfurt International Motor Show a few weeks ago, Bugatti will be making its next high-speed drive in 2018,” the emailed statement said, referring to an anticipated run with the Chiron. The Chiron is limited to 500 vehicles, more than 300 of which have already been sold.
“In the future, we will maintain our philosophy of building a production super sports car that is not only designed for maximum speed but also meets the highest possible demands in terms of luxury, comfort, everyday drivability and durability,” Bugatti said. “The new Chiron combines the best in all these areas which makes it the world’s most complete super sports car and a unique concept.”
Outsiders expect the response to pack a resounding wallop.
“Koenigsegg took this record from Bugatti, who we work very closely with as well,” said Michelin’s Schmedding, who due to confidentiality agreements declined to give additional specifics about future projects. “I’m sure they will plan to answer in 2018 with the Chiron. We expect that will happen.”
Sitting in his office in Sweden, Wade also anticipates an answer from Bugatti. It’s only a matter of time.
“Bugatti gives the car certain characteristics in terms of refinement that its customers are looking for,” he said. “We are more aggressive from a track standpoint—we have a much lighter car. But Bugatti haven’t run the Chiron to top speed yet, so we’ll wait and see what they can do. It’ll be something.”

=== Title: 2018 Audi R8 Spyder Review: $175,000 of Power and Precision - Bloomberg ===

The 2018 Audi R8 Spyder is the first car I've driven that has caused a passerby to face-plant onto a concrete sidewalk.
He was so distracted, craning his neck to look at the canary-yellow supercar, that he fell face-first into the pavement. The sequence was so bad, so complete, it looked like a scene from a movie.   
It felt appropriate, not just because it is such an eye-catching car. Recently Audi itself has had a bit of a face-plant. Last week German authorities 
 they had uncovered more Audi vehicles equipped with systems rigged to cheat emissions tests. It’s the first time prosecutors have investigated Audi cars sold specifically in Europe as part of parent-company Volkswagen AG's “dieselgate” scandal.  
The announcement widened the ongoing criminal investigation that started in 2015 and most recently involved 
 at Audi in March. VW’s scandal has cost it 
 so far. The emphasis for the next few years is going to be on making sure drivers still trust Audi's excellent if bland sedans and appealing SUVs—the brand's bread and butter.
But anyway, let's talk about spending $175,100 on an Audi convertible!  
This is the soft-top version of the 
. Audi first unveiled it in 2009. Today, both of those cars are humbler cousins to the 
, also produced by VW. In fact, both the R8 coupe and the Spyder share an engine (540 horsepower for the Audis, 602hp for the Lambo), seven-speed transmission (AWD for the R8), and track-ready chassis with the decidedly more expensive, aggressive Huracán.
Some new elements on the Spyder are worth noting. Audi has pushed the driver’s cockpit in the Spyder farther forward in the car, echoing the command position in the R8 LMS GT3 race car on which it’s based. Audi has also integrated the Bluetooth microphone into the seatbelt, rather than the dash, so a driver may take hands-free calls with the top down without the wind obliterating every word.
The $192,000 R8 that I tested easily passed the open-air phone-call test on a weekend errand to Montauk, N.Y., with the designers and owners of Double Rainbouu and the head designer for DVF. I also drove it back and forth for the week to the office and on sundry jaunts around Manhattan's East Village. It’s equally at home in highway and city settings, though the tight suspension wore on us after a few hours at cruising speed, and the ramrod-straight seats, combined with stingy legroom, forced my 6’3’’ cyclist friend to fold his lanky frame like origami.
(The seats won’t move back very far because, well, that automatic top is stored under the shell at the rear of the car, right behind them. The storage space in the R8 is under the hood, rather than in the trunk—this is a mid-engined monster, remember. Cyclist was fine with it. Thankfully, it was a warm, dry night. The scenario would have been impossible had we needed the top up.)
Fuel efficiency here is 17 miles per gallon in combined driving, similar to that of the 
 and less than the 
's. But efficiency is not why one would buy a sports car, anyway.
There are other reasons to buy the R8. For one, it looks sexy with those back vents along the rear, new Audi laser-light headlights, and huge carbon-fiber blades that flank the air vents on either side of its body. Its snub nose, low stance, and all-new, 20-inch, 10-spoke-Y design forged wheels keep the overall impression compact—blessedly in check with a design that could easily have become outré. (I’d choose another color over yellow.)
The interior is wrapped in high-gloss carbon and subtle, soft leather. Four distinct drive modes allow it to fly down the highway so magnetically smoothly you might as well be on a monorail; its turning radius and four-corner visibility are so superior as to embolden a driver to the point of dangerous (at least, over-entitled) arrogance; its engine contains some magic quality that allows it to sing as you downshift from 80 miles per hour but remain nearly silent (aka polite) as you crawl through 
. You can hit 60mph in 3.5 seconds. Top speed is 198mph.
While the R8 lacks the intangible but unmistakable driving personality of a 
 or Corvette (maybe it’s all those safety and stability systems), this is certainly the best Audi has to offer, even more prestigious and exciting to drive than the R8 coupe. Yes, I know it’s heavier, but that’s so literal. As you know if you ever look through 
 
, there’s something about convertibles that ignites the imagination.
My favorite part about the R8 is its virtual cockpit: genius. Everything, including the 12.3-inch LCD digital instrument cluster, is set behind the steering wheel, right in front of the driver. That means you never have to glance right to change music or climate settings. I felt more safe and focused while driving with this format than I have for a long time.
What’s more, the round gauges contained therein are so beautiful and well executed that they look like they’re jumping out from the screen in front of you. And the design clears the dashboard of extraneous knobs, so where nearly all other luxury cars today have a big computer screen in the center of the dashboard, only an air vent disrupts the line of the modest black dash. In a car whose space comes at a premium—there is no back seat, not even a ledge, and the “trunk” at the front can hold only the smallest overnight bags—such intelligent design is crucial.
As it wades through its legal problems, Audi shouldn’t lose this type of thought and careful consideration as to how technological function must influence form.  Here’s hoping.
 
 

=== Title: McLaren 720S Review: For $280,000, It's a Little Awkward - Bloomberg ===

The McLaren 720S has earned many accolades.
Most notably, 
 named it 
 for 2017. 
But the McLaren 720S is a difficult car to love.
It’s not that it doesn’t represent a phenomenal feat of engineering and design. It does.
But this car is so advanced, it’s clinical. The 720S may be worth the $284,745 required to own it when it comes out in May, but I predict you’ll have more fun—you know, emotionally—on a regular basis living with something else.
McLaren’s 720S is the first car I’ve driven in a long time that genuinely required an orientation before pulling out of the parking lot. By orientation, I mean a technician sitting in the passenger seat and taking 15 minutes to explain how to change drive modes (Comfort, Sport, or Track), adjust the height of the front nose (to negotiate potholes and sudden inclines), engage the rear air brake, use the push-button parking brake, and even turn on the radio. At least a few of those things shouldn’t have had to be explained.
This is not a knock on the car per se. Vehicles should be evaluated based on their intended, stated purpose. McLaren positions its newcomer as having “extreme performance DNA,” and that it certainly does. If that is the only thing you are looking for, you will likely appreciate it. This machine is not meant for silk-walking SoHo’s cobblestone labyrinth or navigating Chinatown’s back alleyways. (I mean, I did do that, among other, smoother, faster jaunts to upstate New York and Long Island. But I don’t count those hairy moments against it.) The space in the cockpit is larger than that of its predecessor, big enough to feel comfortable. And the front trunk is large enough to accommodate a light weekends’ worth of luggage.
But since I look at cars from more of an experiential perspective, I feel obliged to warn you about its drawbacks. In the midst of all the car’s splendid advancements, something has been lost. Maybe user logic was just overlooked in favor of other priorities, but few things in this car are easy or intuitive. Reach out to change the positioning of a side mirror, say, and you’ll spend a few moments looking for a knob in the wrong place. (It’s underneath the steering wheel.) You’ll wait three seconds before the parking brake disengages. You’ll push one small button to “activate” an override system before “activating” the spoiler and then turning other knobs to switch drive modes.
It’s one thing to sacrifice comfort and ergonomics in the service of the shape and function of a vehicle that’s more rocket than car. But the awkwardness inside the 720S goes even further than that of its high-priced rivals, the Lamborghini Aventador S and the Bugatti Chiron. (Those will set you back about $420,000 and $2.99 million, respectively—raising the fair question of whether having a conveniently-placed side mirror toggle is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to you.)
Combined with overactive proximity sensors that beep and ring even in normal traffic, a stop/start function that functioned roughly half the time, and an odd, Star Trek-y center console that literally blocks direct access to the cup holder that sits behind it, many things in the cabin of the 720S feel just a step too difficult. When the cutouts in the bottom portion of the (optional) sport seats routinely consume cameras and wallets and cell phones because you set those things there between your legs instead of any (absent) door wells, or side pockets, or even divots around the cabin big enough to hold the normal accoutrements of modern daily life, you’ve got a problem.
This struggle to achieve a smartly minimal yet dynamic cabin design, with intuitive working crash-avoidance, driving, and entertainment systems is not new to McLaren. When the 650S Coupé made its debut in 2014, the only real demerits from most critics regarded the car’s electronics.
The 720S represents the first time McLaren has replaced an entire product family; it is the successor to the 650S and the second-generation in the Super Series line that denotes the highest-performance side of the McLaren brand. The universe inside its two-passenger rounded pod of a cockpit 
 better than the company’s first effort. It just needs to be better than better.
Anyway, I started with dissecting the interior of the car because I want to end this column on a positive note. And there are many positive things to say about the 720S.   
The 720S is lighter, faster, and more dynamically capable than its predecessor. Credit goes to a new carbon fiber monocoque “tub” and upper structure that give newfound strength and rigidity to the 2,828-pound coupe.
From behind the wheel, it feels feather light. You experience the lightness, without question, the moment you get inside and push the gas pedal—but especially in the higher gears. When it comes to the drive, the word “flawless” comes to mind, as does “compliant.” The responsive, instantaneous steering and balanced grip of the 720S even around the most harrowing of corners are without peer.
New (of course) are the 4.0-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 mid-engine and seven-speed, dual-clutch, rear-wheel-drive transmission. They produce 710 horsepower and 568 pound-feet of torque. Top speed is 212 mph; zero to 60 mph is an insane 2.8 seconds.
It does feel insane. At one moment cruising up the Palisades Parkway last week I saw 115 mph on the speedometer. I had no idea we were going that fast—the car was as chilled and compliant (there’s that word again) as a little robot kitten. This, more than any car I’ve driven this year, represents a dangerous proposition when it comes to speeding tickets: To drive it is to get lost in the experience of moving beautifully and effortlessly through space. Unfortunately “lost in the experience of moving beautifully and effortlessly through space” doesn’t tend to convince state troopers that one shouldn’t be punished for speeding.
I should note that the superfluous wind noise above 100 mph was disappointing. It grated on the nerves and impeded on conversation, radio levels, peace of mind. And latent brakes lacked the initial bite one loves to feel—expects to feel—from a car of this magnitude. They left me needing more immediate feedback than what they gave.
If you are a fan of McLaren, the first thing you’ll notice about the 720S is that looks different from anything else on the market—but maybe you won’t be able to put your finger on why exactly it screams, “Look at me.” It’ll take a moment or two to determine that the odd feeling comes from the lack of radiator intakes on either side of the car. It’s like seeing a belly without a button.
Instead, the “double-skin” design of the dihedral doors channels air to radiators that help cool the engine. With the doors raised, the 720S is among the top two or three most visually arresting cars on the road today. (See also: 
, or anything from 
 and 
.)  
The 720S has the widest breadth of any McLaren ever built. This makes it at least incrementally more suitable for traipsing around town. You’ll definitely want to do that, too, mostly to show off. This is nothing if not a jaw-hanging-to-your-chest type of car—both from behind the wheel and from the sidewalk.
Just be sure you get the full orientation before you push Start.
 

=== Title: As Traders Await Bitcoin Futures, Margin Requirements Are High - Bloomberg ===

Among the complications in trading bitcoin future contracts that launch this Sunday: People speculating on the cryptocurrency will need to put more cash on the table. 
Options Clearing Corp. has set the initial margin requirements at 44 percent of the daily settlement price. Cboe Global Market Inc., which announced that amount on Monday, hasn’t updated it through bitcoin’s wild price swings in the days since. It was raised to that level from 33 percent “in view of bitcoin price volatility,” the exchange operator said at the time.
The cryptocurrency has swung at least 15 percent each of the last three days, and has surged by almost $5,000 this week. It was at $14,990 at 1:15 p.m. in New York on Friday.
A margin requirement is how much investors have to set aside as collateral, so that other parties in the trade know any losses can be covered. The requirement for bitcoin futures is several times that of commodities such as gold and oil.
“One of the reasons why the futures margin requirements are so high is because of the limited size of the overall bitcoin market,” Kevin Kelly, managing partner of Benchmark Investments, which analyzes futures markets to develop indexes. “There’s a lack of depth and breadth.”
The requirement for minimum maintenance margin was also increased to 40 percent from 30 percent, according to the letter.
The Futures Industry Association said in a letter to regulators this week that the trade group of banks and brokers doesn’t believe cryptocurrency trading risks have been properly assessed. The concerns included that exchanges failed to get enough feedback from market participants on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests and clearing.
The price swings have put some of the

In London last September, some lucky duck paid

. A vintage Bentley may be expensive to maintain, and it may not gain more than a few percentage points in value each year, but it will hold its value for decades.
And from behind the wheel, it’ll make you feel like a million bucks.
“There are plenty of examples of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys that can be purchased for entry-level prices,” said Jonathan Klinger, spokesman for Hagerty. “For someone getting into the fun side of the car industry, just the name Rolls-Royce or Bentley is all you need.”
At the moment, they are valued “properly” in the relative market, Klinger said.
This means that now-obscure models such as the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph (manufactured from 1998-2002) and Bentley Arnage (1998-2009) can be had for the same price as a midsized Toyota, but with scads more personality and style.
“For the Arnage, a savvy buyer can watch that market and expect it to gain value over five years,” Klinger said. “Certainly, over the next couple years, the Arnage is one to watch.”
Or take the Rolls-Royce Corniche, a coupe-and-convertible model made from 1971 to 1995. The Corniche replaced the older Silver Shadow and brought a then-revolutionary V8 engine and self-righting suspension to the English automaker’s stable. With a large, flat silver grille and the obligatory Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament; a wide wood-polished dashboard; slim steering wheel; firm, yet springy seats; and just enough modern technology (radio, heat, air conditioning), the Corniche is as livable on a daily basis as it is handsome.
The average value of a Corniche Series I is $34,300 for one in excellent condition—or as low as $25,000 for one 
.    
, an artist based in Los Angeles, bought an affordable 1981 Corniche several years ago. He still drives it every day.  
“I bought the Corniche because it was different—timelessly elegant and thoroughly British,” James said. “And it’s something that is driveable in the meantime.”
The flip side: Maintenance on something such as the Corniche can easily surpass the car’s value. While James maintains a close relationship with a trusted mechanic friend that keeps costs for him very low, others are not so lucky. Klinger has known L.A.-area Bentley dealers to charge as much as $35,000 to repair one turbo in a late-model Continental. (The 
 close to $1,500 online.)
Those looking to buy a modern classic Rolls-Royce or Bentley should demand a very documented service history. Avoid examples with neglected or deferred maintenance, unless you like to do a lot of the work yourself or are prepared to pay a king’s ransom to have someone else do it.
But most of all, be patient in the hunt. While late-model Corniches and Arnages 
 in value over the past few years, Hagerty hedges that values could always dip, too, so it’s really about waiting for the right car, as opposed to jumping in at the bottom to try to maximize your investment. These models aren’t going anywhere. 
“If you want a comfortable luxurious car, they absolutely represent a lot of car for the money,” Klinger said. “They always stand for the pinnacle of luxury. And that goes on throughout any stage of them.”

=== Title: U.S. Growth Pickup to Spur Earlier Fed Hike in ‘18, Survey Shows - Bloomberg ===

A strengthening U.S. economy may spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates twice in the next 3 1/2 months as a tight labor market pushes risks to the upside, a Bloomberg survey showed.
Median results of the survey of 41 economists, conducted Dec. 5-7, showed economists still expect three rate hikes in 2018 but moved forward one of those projected moves to March from June. There was near unanimity the central bank will raise the target range for the federal funds rate a quarter percentage point to 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent after its two-day meeting starting Tuesday in Washington.
“The unemployment rate has fallen sharply to 4.1 percent and on top of that we’ve had two straight quarters of 3 percent-plus growth,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. “Everything on the economic front is pointing toward more and not fewer hikes.”
The Federal Open Market Committee will issue a statement and new economic projections at 2 p.m. on Wednesday. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m.
That’s expected to be Yellen’s last post-meeting session with the media. Fed Governor Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump’s nominee to succeed her in February, is likely to be confirmed by the Senate.
Economists don’t expect the leadership change to result in any major shift in Fed policy in 2018. Ninety percent of those surveyed said they believe the path of the fed funds rate will be “about the same” next year compared with their expectations had Yellen been reappointed.
Economists do, however, see the economy beginning to pick up in ways that weren’t evident in mid-2017. The survey showed the perceived balance of risks to the outlook for inflation and growth shifting noticeably higher, with 63 percent of those surveyed now seeing risks tilted to the upside. That means they think it’s more likely that growth and inflation will exceed the Fed’s expectations than fall short. In the September poll, just 25 percent saw risks tilted to the upside.
That balance was tilted to the upside in Bloomberg’s March survey, but shifted to “roughly balanced,” and slightly to the downside, after inflation readings fell below expectations for several months beginning in March.
The Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, after excluding food and energy, fell as low as 1.3 percent in August, though inched back to 1.4 percent in October. It’s been below the Fed’s 2 percent target for most of the past five years. Gross domestic product on an annualized basis exceeded 3 percent in the second and third quarters this year, the first time it’s done that in two consecutive quarters since 2014.
Economists predicted a few changes in new quarterly projections that Fed officials will submit next week. Most notably they expected the median Fed forecast for economic growth in 2018 to reach 2.3 percent, up from 2.1 percent in September. They didn’t expect policy makers, however, to adjust their median forecast for inflation at the end of 2018 from 1.9 percent.
For those predicting higher growth forecasts, respondents were split over what would be the single biggest driver, with 15 citing the Republican tax package currently making its way through Congress and 15 pointing to faster global growth.
“Global growth is going to be a positive for U.S. exports, there’s no question about that, but consumer spending is 70 percent of the economy,” said Brian Horrigan, chief economist at money manager Loomis Sayles & Co. in Boston. Tax cuts for households and companies “could be a bigger factor” in boosting the economy in 2018, he said.
When it comes to the biggest threats to the U.S. economy in 2018, 45 percent chose “an external economic or financial shock.” Another 25 percent said a steep decline in stocks was the biggest potential threat while 23 percent chose “a disruption in external trade relations.”

=== Title: Maria Balshaw of the Tate Museum Has the Art World on Her Shoulders - Bloomberg ===

The normally staid world of museum exhibitions has been upended over the past two years by a series of protests that have made global headlines. In 2016, Greenpeace shut down an exhibition at the British Museum sponsored by BP Plc, the fossil fuel giant. In March climate activists in Paris staged dramatic protests demanding that the Louvre abandon its financial agreement with Total SA, another oil and gas behemoth.
That same month, a group of artists in New York attempted to remove a painting depicting the open casket of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black boy who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, from the Whitney Museum of American Art, because it was painted by a white woman. Meanwhile, anti-gay protests closed a gender-diversity exhibition at Santander Bank’s cultural center in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
Call it a symptom of regional strife or simply the growing pains of an increasingly global society, but for Maria Balshaw, who became director of 
in June, an energized, politically active public presents an opportunity. “The goal I have for the Tate is one where an artistic vision is held alongside, and absolutely permeates, a sense of our social mission,” she says on a recent afternoon, sitting in the sixth-floor restaurant at London’s Tate Modern.
The cavernous brick monolith looming over the Thames is one of two Tates in the city. Liverpool has another outpost, and St. Ives, a popular seaside retreat in Cornwall, England, has yet another, which reopened in October after an overhaul that cost £20 million ($26 million).
Balshaw, 47, has taken the helm at arguably the most fertile point in the museum’s history: Last year the Tate branches together hosted 8.4 million global visitors, a figure that would represent 15 percent of the U.K.’s total population. According to an 
 survey, the Tate Modern is the world’s most popular modern and contemporary art museum.
Now that the renovation of the Tate St. Ives, housed in a former gasworks, is complete, Balshaw is free from major capital campaigns and can devote her considerable resources to the exhibitions that she—and the public—cares about most. “We have a responsibility to balance that social, ethical, and artistic vision together,” she says. The museum generally plans its programming five years in advance, and, with its various locations and £110 million budget, it’s far from agile. But Balshaw’s top priority doesn’t need to wait: She simply wants to bring art to even more human beings. And then more after that. “By 2027, let’s say, I would hope that the Tate is part of the life experience and cultural activities of a much wider demographic of people,” she says. “The Tate has expanded the landscape for art in this country. Now it needs to ensure that that expanded landscape is shared with the widest community of people possible. That’s the social return on the public’s investment.” Her bet, she says, is that a more diverse range of artists will bring in a more diverse public. “I don’t think we should underestimate the curiosity in our wider audience.”
Paul Owens, the director of arts consultant BOP, says Balshaw’s predecessor, fundraising juggernaut Nick Serota, had a strategy that “depended on very wealthy people.” He adds: “In major cities, where you have a rampaging inequality, cultural institutions are trying to answer the question: How do they address other people in society?”
Whether by accident or design, Balshaw has a résumé tailor-made for the times: Her first job after leaving academia was to research the impact of art programs in schools. After a subsequent stint as a regional director of development for the Arts Council England, she was hired as the director of the University of Manchester’s Whitworth Art Gallery in 2006.
It was at the Whitworth that Balshaw began to flex her muscle, giving female artists such as Cornelia Parker huge solo shows and championing exhibitions that examined cultural conflict. She spearheaded one timed to the bicentenary of Britain’s abolition of slavery, “Trade and Empire: Remembering Slavery,” which combined 18th century watercolors that depicted slaves working in sugar colonies alongside contemporary pieces by black artists.
In 2011, Balshaw took on the additional role of director at the Manchester Art Gallery. There, she pushed exhibitions with a political bent, such as a multimedia show by the conceptual artist Jeremy Deller that explored the impact of the British Industrial Revolution on popular culture. The lead image of the exhibition was possibly Deller’s most famous: a 1973 photo of the glam rocker Adrian Street, covered in makeup and draped in a bejeweled cape, vamping next to his coal miner father, who wears a look of comic terror.
“She has this incredible ability to bring people and communities from all walks of life together through art,” says Raqib Shaw, an artist who had a solo exhibition at the Whitworth. “Her projects are accessible, immersive, and thought-provoking.”
When it was announced in January that she’d be replacing Serota, the Tate’s director of three decades, it was a surprise to many in the international art world, but a logical choice to most people who knew her. “It was absolutely the most perfect progression,” says Samantha Lackey, who is senior curator of programs at the Whitworth and who was hired by Balshaw.
The organization Balshaw inherits at the Tate—with its permanent collection of more than 70,000 artworks, a staff numbering more than 900 employees, and at least a dozen exhibitions going on at any given moment—is a dramatic departure from Manchester. “It has an enormous brand,” says Gail Lord, the president of Lord Cultural Resources Inc., an international consultant that’s done work for the Tate. “They now have an awful lot of real estate. The real challenge will be to make it work and get significant numbers of more people engaged.”
The museum was founded in the late 19th century by Henry Tate, a sugar baron who, after his donation of pre-Raphaelite art was rejected by the National Gallery, led a campaign to build a new museum for British art. He opened the first gallery, overlooking the Thames a short walk from the houses of Parliament, in 1897. When Serota took over its single building in the 1970s, through sheer force of will he raised the funds to open the Tate Liverpool (1988) and the Tate St. Ives (1993) and to purchase the derelict power station in Bankside, across the river from St. Paul’s Cathedral, that would become the Tate Modern (2000). Sixteen years later he expanded that building by 60 percent with a $372 million addition. “It’s important to remember that 20 years ago, London was not the center of the art world,” Balshaw says. “We just accept it as if it’s always been like this.”
But with that stupendous growth came the absence of anything that would ruffle the feathers of the museum’s myriad supporters. Only about a third of the Tate’s funding comes from the government; it generates the rest through corporate and private donations and ticket sales to special exhibitions. (Bloomberg LP, which owns 
, is a major donor to the Tate.) And so, over the past decade or two, the Tate Modern has put on inoffensive blockbusters such as the exhibition of Matisse cutouts in 2014. The Tate Britain has had wild successes as well, like the recent David Hockney retrospective, seen by a record half million visitors. Another magnificent show, “Turner and the Masters,” compared English Romantic painter J.M.W. Turner’s art with paintings by Rembrandt, Titian, and Canaletto. This sort of programming, while popular, sparks discussion of art history rather than a raw examination of current affairs.
Balshaw’s willingness to break from that model might rock the boat. But the trustees who appointed her seem to be ready for a change. Several shows, including “Queer British Art” at the Tate Britain (which closed on Oct. 1) and “Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power” at the Tate Modern (which closed on Oct. 22), demonstrate that leadership had already begun to pivot toward more “woke” programming even before it hired Balshaw.
She’s thought of some quick strategies to expand her audience. She mentions extending museum hours: “Fifteen years ago, when my children were under 5, I would have given any amount of money in the world to find somewhere that was open and had something interesting going on before 6 a.m.” And she’s hoping to encourage an event-based culture, citing a gay pride celebration in the context of “Queer British Art” as an example. If she can prove that a more diverse crowd wants to learn from exciting, controversial work, she expects all the museum’s various supporters will get in line.
“We don’t get money from the public purse just because someone fancies it,” she says. “We’re funded because we make a difference.”

=== Title: Num June Paik Is the Art-World Bargain Everyone's Missing Out On - Bloomberg ===

As prices for mid-century American artists rise to 
 that make even billionaires blanch, dealers have turned to 
, northern 
, and 
 to “discover” people whose markets still have room for growth. But savvy collectors who rifle through the annals of Western art history might be shocked to discover that some of the most important artists of the 20th century remain bargains hiding in plain sight.
Those collectors might start with 
 (1932-2006), a Korea-born American who is widely considered the father of video art. Paik’s work, which started out as performance and composition, then moved to video art, is in the permanent collection of museums around the world. Paik’s 
, moreover, is in the Smithsonian Institution, and in 2015 his estate 
 that it would be represented by the powerful, multinational Gagosian Gallery.
And yet Paik’s prices, while not at flea market levels (they mostly range between $20,000 and $200,000, with a few spikes in excess of $1 million), are dwarfed by such contemporaries as Robert Rauschenberg, whose art regularly sells for 10 times that amount.
“Paik is a very important figure for art-historical development within the last 40 years,” said Heike Grossmann, a director at 
 in Munich, which organized a show last year that combined Paik’s work with his better-known peer, artist Joseph Beuys. “But compared to other [similar artists], he’s underrated on the market,” she said.
Now, as six artworks by Paik come up to auction this spring in New York, Seoul, and Hong Kong, with prices ranging from $3,000 to $230,000, dealers are taking a hard look at the causes for Paik’s relative market obscurity. Most of these reasons for his relative lack of popularity appear to come down to a dearth of art-historical awareness from collectors, an absence of aggressive gallery support, and, to a much lesser extent, concerns regarding the long-term condition of the work. The final possible cause—whether people are willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for video art at all—has been put to bed only in the last decade: Last year a video by artist Bruce Nauman sold for $1.6 million at Christie's New York, and artist Bill Viola's work (auction record: $700,000) regularly sells for more than $200,000 at public auction.
Paik was prolific. He began with music compositions in the early 1960s, in one instance splicing together a piano score, sound effects, and his own screams. Soon he started working with TVs, initially spreading them around a room and distorting them with magnets.
He almost immediately found patrons in Germany—the billionaire Flick family reportedly bought many of Paik’s early pieces directly from his studio. By the late 1980s, when Paik’s market had taken off, “he was working with too many dealers,” said Hans Mayer, whose eponymous 
 has sold work by Paik for more than 25 years. “I was doing a lot of business with Paik, but certainly when my colleagues realized what kind of business was possible, everyone jumped on it.”
Many dealers were selling Paik’s art, but there wasn’t one gallery to control his distribution channels—and by extension, his prices. "I’d say his work was just kind of lost in the market for a number of years," said Nick Simunovic, director of Gagosian Gallery Hong Kong, who handles the Paik estate. "Partly because there wasn’t a strong gallery, and I also think there was a sense that the technological aspect of things could sometimes frighten collectors away."
Without a dealer to explain away collectors' misgivings and advocate for strong prices, Paik’s market was left to founder. “Masterpieces are selling for $600,000,” said Mayer. “Considering the importance of the artist, they should be selling in the range of $1.2 million.”
Paik’s market hasn’t drifted completely into obscurity. Korea is arguably still his most enduring market. “In Korea, he was a superstar,” said Carl Solway, whose self-titled 
 is Paik’s longest- running dealer. “In Seoul you could get a taxi and ask the driver, and he’d know who Paik was. It was always a strong market for him, because he was one of the first Korean artist to establish on an international level.”
Gagosian also recently held a show of Paik's work in Hong Kong with works from the estate. "It sold really well," said Simunovic. "Mostly to museums or private collectors who are building museums in Asia." 
Even so, Paik’s glow in the U.S. has surely faded.
Part of that has to do with the nature of the work itself, which “requires learning and understanding,” said 
, an artist who worked in Paik’s studio for more than 25 years, and who now consults on Paik’s work. “Visually [his art] is nice, but the content can be heavy and philosophically deep. It’s not so easy.”
That opacity could be a barrier for some collectors who are new to Paik’s art. “I always explain it by saying when you’re invited to someone’s house and see a work by 
, you know it cost a million dollars,” said Mayer. “And so people can come in and be knowledgeable and say, ‘Oh what a wonderful Fontana!’ It’s the same thing as fashion: If you buy something from Prada, everyone knows it’s expensive.” When you come into a room and see a Paik video installation, in contrast, some explanation would invariably be necessary.
Paik’s art, which includes compilations of video screens in the shape of dogs and piles of monitors meant to look like robots, could therefore be shunned by some new collectors because it doesn’t carry cultural cachet.
Still, said Saueracker, Paik’s obscurity also presents an opportunity. “Currently, owning a Paik work is about connoisseurship, or because the collector met the artist in person,” he said. “But this will change over time, and I think the idea of discovering everything Paik stands for will drive a new momentum.”
The other barrier to entry in Paik’s market is the question of the works' condition: Paik used technology that wasn’t built to last: TVs burn out, machines break down, lights break and go dark. When art has an expiration date, collectors might (understandably) be more reticent to spend millions on it.
Paik’s advocates brush away questions of maintenance. “You can just call a specialist who can repair it when the TV breaks,” said Mayer. “This isn’t a problem. Perhaps in 20 or 30 or 40 years, it could be.”
Saueracker, who is one of the specialists people call when their Paik is broken, said that even in 40 years, the work should still be fine. “They can all be repaired,” he said, pointing to a technician in Germany who now make replacement tubes for TVs. “Now we’re more or less able to put another life-cycle in a TV, which is kind of a major thing.”
Even if a TV were to be irreparable, "the point is that a Paik sculpture or installation is not about the circuitry or the guts inside," said Simunovic. "It’s about the format of the work and the emotions that it’s communicating. And obviously if it has a moving image component, when that component is played on a cassette or an LP or a data file, it’s irrelevant."
Ultimately, said Saueracker,  “it’s not easy to have a Paik, but it becomes a very personal object. You have to live with it, and if you can handle the challenge, it’s very rewarding.”

=== Title: The Forks and Fights Behind Bitcoin's Turbulence - Bloomberg ===

’s price has always been volatile, but its November performance -- including a 
 followed by a rebound to a 
 -- was a doozy even for it. For those trying to follow along, there was no shortage of bitcoin jargon to wade through -- forks, bitcoin cash, Segwit2x and transaction blocks among them. The big picture is this: The turmoil is what happens when a community designed so no one person or group is in charge tries to sort through the vexing technical and commercial problems created by the pioneering digital currency’s success. This may be a minor bump in the road before factions with diverging interests and ideologies come back together. Or it may be a sign that bitcoin’s future is likely to be fractured.
Like most other pieces of software, the bitcoin network needs periodic upgrades to add new capabilities. Bottlenecks in processing bitcoin transactions have been rising, making the 
 for some small transactions. But unlike other pieces of software, it requires a consensus of users -- specifically, miners, whose computers run its software -- to move to a new version. Over the last few months the bitcoin network has already split -- or, in industry parlance, forked -- twice, into three different versions still running today.
In late July, the bitcoin network split into two, giving birth to 
 which featured changes allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. Then in October, the network split off again, giving birth to bitcoin gold, which has a different take on how mining should be done.
When bitcoin cash was launched, most members of the bitcoin community thought of it as an unnecessary step that would be brushed aside by a broader network upgrade already planned for later. Called 
, it was to double the blocks in which bitcoin transactions are processed, increasing the network’s speed and reducing fees. But the long agreed-upon upgrade was scratched at the last minute as support for it waned amid worries about security and clashes between core developers and miners. After the cancellation, bitcoin’s price dove, while bitcoin cash -- currently the bitcoin network with the biggest blocksize -- rallied, coming close to becoming the second-largest crytpocurrency by market capitalization.
Many miners and other users worried that instituting another fork for the SegWit2x upgrade would leave the network open to the so-called 
, meaning that the same transaction could be carried out on the old software and the new. There was also criticism that SegWit2x hadn’t been developed in a transparent manner, which could lead to potential security holes or give its developers an upper hand in governance of the network.
There’s widespread agreement that the bitcoin network needs to be made faster. Proponents of SegWit2x argue that those needs will lead to its eventual adoption. Others have moved on to look for entirely new solutions -- which could mean even more fragmentation of the bitcoin universe.
 was built with security more in mind than the kind of volume its success has brought. To prevent counterfeiting, bitcoin transactions are verified by so-called bitcoin miners in batches called blocks. The blocks are then strung together to form the decentralized open ledger known as the blockchain that’s one of the currency’s biggest selling points. Worries about cyberattacks led the system’s designers to cap the size of blocks at 1 megabyte. But as bitcoin grew in popularity over the past nine years, transaction times and processing fees soared to record levels.
The average time to confirm a bitcoin deal ballooned from under 20 minutes to six hours at one point this year, according to 
. The 
 of transactions rose to a record, 
 as bitcoin holders offered miners increasing amounts to deal with their transactions sooner. In recent weeks, the congestion (and fees) have lightened significantly as some users have steered clear of the traffic jam. Still, the fees are often high enough to render bitcoin’s use in transactions impractical for many consumers.
Created in 2009 by a person or a group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin initially attracted an array of figures including libertarians who wished to counter the control of sovereign regulators and central banks. One attraction is that, in contrast to limitless printed currencies, there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins. And as bitcoin’s market value has surged, the debate has intensified over whether it should embrace more mainstream capitalism or fortify its position as a libertarian beacon. More practically, the debate has revolved around whether bitcoin should become like gold and other assets that store value, or whether the community should focus on developing it as a payment system and platform for economic activity. And -- more importantly -- whether its underlying technology should ever be forked or split.

=== Title: How That Yelp Review Could Complement Government Data: Eco Pulse - Bloomberg ===

Your next restaurant review might offer insight beyond the merits of a local cheeseburger. 
Data from the online restaurant- and business-review platform Yelp.com can provide an up-to-date reading on business conditions, new research suggests. Those findings are the lead item in our economic research roundup this week. We also summarize research on whether a common global factor is weighing down inflation, whether low stock-market volatility is a dangerous sign of complacency, and on spillovers from mass bond-buying programs. Check this column each Tuesday for blurbs on interesting studies from around the world. 
Yelp data can measure economic developments in close-to-real time, new research shows, making the figures a potential complement to government data. Changes in the number of businesses and restaurants reviewed on Yelp can predict shifts in the number of establishments and restaurants in official figures, Harvard University’s Edward Glaeser and his co-authors find. 
Focusing on New York specifically, the authors discover that Yelp seems capable of tracking how neighborhoods are changing even below the zip-code level. So beyond helping with timeliness, leveraging data from online platforms could help make government data more granular. One limitation to this measure: the algorithm they built using the customer-review website’s data is most accurate for dense, wealthy and more-educated areas, because those places make much more extensive use of Yelp than their more rural counterparts. Because it lacks the breadth and consistency of government surveys, the researchers suggest it's a complement to – rather than supplement for – official surveys.
The labor market is luring back people who had given up on searching for work, rather than drawing in large numbers of the unemployed. The graph above shows the two figures as a share of the total population. This matters because if people increasingly come in from off the sidelines, rather than from joblessness, the working population can expand without quickly pushing the headline unemployment rate lower. This is a cyclical pattern – it happened last time the U.S. had a tight labor market– but the gap has gotten wider today as the pool of officially-jobless shrinks. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s economics team is still casting a skeptical eye on the idea that advanced economies are experiencing weak inflation because of common factors. While health care costs have been contained in many nations, weighing on price indices, a dive into other inflation components suggests that most of the slowdown in price gains is due to country-specific effects.
This bolsters the researchers’ confidence that as drag from health care and multifamily housing wanes in the U.S., prices should respond to a tight labor market by picking up. Sweden and Australia could be instructive, they suggest – in both countries, price increases have been gaining steam as tight resource utilization bites. 
Does low stock-marker volatility suggest that investors are complacent? The jury is out, according to New York Fed researchers. On one hand, it’s possible that volatility has been historically elevated, making the current low-volatility situation a return to what should have been normal.
The logic here: theoretically, stock prices should represent the discounted value of future dividends, but in reality they’ve been a lot more volatile than dividends over time. Today’s level is close to what theory would predict, “suggesting that the low volatility puzzle is perhaps less puzzling than originally thought.” On the other, an estimate of the volatility risk premium – basically the expected return from selling insurance on stock-market volatility – is “somewhat low,” suggesting that investors have become more risk tolerant. 
Unconventional monetary policy in the euro area spurred greater lending from the region’s banks to the rest of the world, new research from the European Central Bank finds. The authors also find evidence that area banks boosted lending to Europe’s private sector in response to unconventional policy in the U.S. The effects were especially strong for banks that had been liquidity-constrained, suggesting that global central bank balance sheet expansion provided a major boost by increasing individual banks’ ability to lend. 

=== Title: Jamie Dimon Slams Bitcoin as a ‘Fraud’ - Bloomberg ===

JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer 
 said he would fire any employee trading bitcoin for being “stupid.”
The cryptocurrency “won’t end well,” he told an investor conference in New York on Tuesday, predicting it will eventually blow up. “It’s a fraud” and “worse than tulip bulbs.”
If a JPMorgan trader began trading in bitcoin, he said, “I’d fire them in a second. For two reasons: It’s against our rules, and they’re stupid. And both are dangerous.”
Bitcoin has soared in recent months, spurred by greater acceptance of the blockchain technology that underpins the exchange method and optimism that faster transaction times will encourage broader use of the cryptocurrency. Prices have climbed more than four-fold this year -- a run that has drawn debate over whether that’s a bubble.
Bitcoin initially slipped after Dimon’s remarks. It was down as much as 2.7 percent before recovering. Last week, it slumped after reports that China plans to ban trading of virtual currencies on domestic exchanges, dealing another blow to the $150 billion cryptocurrency market.
Tulips are a reference to the mania that swept Holland in the 17th century, with speculators driving up prices of virtually worthless tulip bulbs to exorbitant levels. That didn’t end well.
In bitcoin’s case, Dimon said he’s skeptical authorities will allow a currency to exist without state oversight, especially if something goes wrong. “Someone’s going to get killed and then the government’s going to come down,” he said. “You just saw in China, governments like to control their money supply.”
Dimon differentiated between the bitcoin currency and the underlying blockchain technology, which he said can be useful. Still, he said banks’ application of blockchain “won’t be overnight.”
The bank chief said he wouldn’t short bitcoin because there’s no telling how high it will go before it collapses. The best argument he’s heard, he said, is that it can be useful to people in places with no other options -- so long as the supply of coins doesn’t surge.
“If you were in Venezuela or Ecuador or 
 or a bunch of parts like that, or if you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than U.S. dollars,” he said. “So there may be a market for that, but it’d be a limited market.”
To be sure, Dimon later noted that his daughter purchased some bitcoin.
“It’s interesting that somebody with that high profile of the establishment is out there with that bold statement,” Jeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer of DoubleLine Capital, said on a webcast Tuesday after Dimon’s remarks. 
Gundlach said he doesn’t have a view on bitcoin but that he’s concerned it may be more vulnerable to manipulation than enthusiasts admit. “Maybe I’m just too old, but I’m going to let this mania go on without me.”
One place where cryptocurrencies and traditional finance are coming together is at 
, the owner of the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Last month, the firm teamed up with Gemini Trust Co. -- the startup created by the Winklevoss twins made famous by the 2010 Facebook film “The Social Network” -- with a plan to offer bitcoin futures.
CBOE’s chairman and CEO, Ed Tilly, defended such efforts after Dimon’s remarks.
“Like it or not, people want exposure to bitcoin,” Tilly said. Believers can bet on its rise, and Dimon is welcome to take the other side, he said. “We’re happy to be the ones in the middle.”

=== Title: How Far Will You Go for a Quality In-Flight Movie Experience? - Bloomberg ===

On a recent flight to Florida, I’m in row 32, seat B. To my left, a teenager watches 
 on his iPhone. To my right, a grandma watches 
 on the seat-back TV, sound bleeding from her airline earbuds.
Me? I’m catching up on the original 
, viewing a screen that extends to the edges of my peripheral vision, with resonant, crystal-clear, surround sound. My butt may be in coach, but my head is in an IMAX theater.
I’m wearing the 
, a $799 “mobile theater” that debuted earlier this year. The headset combines noise-cancelling headphones with twin 1920×1080 curved optical displays that, according to the website of Fremont, Calif.-based Royole Corp., creates an experience equivalent to seeing a movie on an 800-inch screen from 65 feet. I’d describe it as sitting in the third row in front of the big screen at your local multiplex. 
The eyepiece, which fits over your face like a scuba mask, are hinged to the headphones at the ears. To control your experience, the Royole Moon uses a modified Android operating system, which you control by swiping on the side. With a Wi-Fi connection, you can access such apps as Netflix, Hulu, and the recently added “Royole Lounge”—a partnership with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. For offline viewing, the Royole Moon comes with 32 gigabytes of onboard memory, enough for nearly 20 movies (though the battery will last only through about 5 hours worth).
If you were to see a plane full of people wearing these, you’d feel as if you had stepped into a stylishly appointed dystopian film. When you’re the only person on the plane wearing one, though, the effect is a touch more comedic. (Being an early adopter is hard.) At least the effective noise cancellation (>92%) and the eyepiece that completely envelopes your vision means you won’t see or hear the people who point and ask each other what that thing is on your head.
For those who want to maintain a little more situational awareness in a smaller package, try the $499 
 from Belmont, Calif.-based company Avegant Corp. Rather than having two bands hinged together as the Royole Moon does, the video headset’s eye pieces are contained on the inside of the headband. In use, it looks like a chunky pair of Beats headphones worn with the headband over your eyes, an effect mimicking the look of Geordi La Forge, the 
 character played by LeVar Burton.
The adjustable headphones fit snugly, depending on the size of your head, and the sound is full and crisply layered. With a small wraparound cover over the eyepieces, these can be used as headphones, though they’re not comfortable enough to sustain long listening sessions.
When watching video, the eyepiece containing part of the headband rests on the bridge of your nose, using one of four included, adjustable nosepads. The video headset has no storage or means of connecting directly to the web. Instead, it connects to your phone, tablet, or laptop via a mini-HDMI cable. 
Comparing the resolution of the two is tricky, because of the unusual technology deployed for the Avegant headset. Rather than having screens with familiar pixel resolutions, it beams images directly onto your retinas, using an array of 2 million microscopic mirrors. The resulting image is clear and bright, though not as seemingly “large” as the Royole Moon’s. And because the eyepieces rest on the bridge of your nose, without any kind of scuba mask apparatus surrounding the eyepieces, you can have an immersive cinematic experience while retaining enough peripheral vision to know if a flight attendant is approaching with the drinks cart.
That additional peripheral vision gives the Avegant another function as a computer monitor. In fact, I am typing these words on a Bluetooth keyboard connected to my phone, which is plugged into the headset. The text is visible to me with essentially the scale and clarity I’d enjoy sitting at my desk facing a 23-inch monitor.
Even though I touch-type, I prefer a bit of a look at my hands on the keys. Should the in-flight laptop ban return, I see myself using this as a workaround. More practically, either of these headsets would also be useful for late night, in-bed TV viewing that won’t disturb a sleeping spouse.

=== Title: Robot Productivity Boon Demands a Little Patience: Eco Pulse - Bloomberg ===

Don’t give up on the robots just yet. 
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are not currently driving major pickups in productivity and output, but that doesn’t mean they won’t, Erik Brynjolfsson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Chad Syverson at the University of Chicago write in a new paper.
That’s the lead item in this week’s economic research roundup, which also summarizes studies on the dollar’s influence on global trade and a look at how the recession scarred trade. Check this column every Tuesday for summaries of new and pertinent studies from around the world. 
Productivity growth has declined by half over the past decade and inflation-adjusted incomes are stagnating. The trends are confusing in an era marked by technological advancement and the dawn of artificial intelligence, but Brynjolfsson, Syverson and their co-author Daniel Rock argue that this is partly due to a lag effect: AI and machine learning technology capabilities just haven’t had time to diffuse widely.  
New technologies have historically taken a long time to spread in an economically important way, the authors note. E-commerce didn’t become the driving disruptor in the retail industry until years after the dot-com boom, for instance, as infrastructure and customers took time to adjust. Now, leveraging the newest technologies will require investments in human capital and skills and the creation of new processes and business models.  “Both the AI investments and the complementary changes are costly, hard to measure, and take time to implement, and this can, at least initially, depress productivity as it is currently measured,” the authors write.

A 1 percent rise in the U.S. dollar against all other global currencies predicts a 0.6 percent to 0.8 percent drop  in trade volume between countries in the rest of the world over the year. That’s the finding of a new paper from Harvard University economist Gita Gopinath and co-authors, which leverages a massive new dataset of bilateral trade prices and volumes and controls for the business cycle. The paper’s main point is to challenge the Mundell-Fleming paradigm, which holds that the price of imported goods fluctuates closely with the bilateral exchange rate. In previous work, Gopinath has made the case that the value of a nation’s currency relative to the dollar is actually a crucial driver of import prices and quantities, regardless of where the goods come from – in large part because most trade is invoiced in a handful of dominant currencies, and the dollar plays an outsize role. This new paper’s results support that dominant currency theory. 
International trade collapsed in the years in and after the Great Recession, costing the U.S. a generation of exporters, a new Fed analysis finds. As existing firms shuttered, new entrants into the business slowed dramatically, cutting into the variety of U.S. good sold abroad. Had entry and exit rates stayed near their historical averages, 2014 exports would have been 31 percent above the pre-recession level. Instead, data show they were only 14 percent higher – underlining the extent of the slump. At the same time, the exporters that stayed in business sold in higher volumes, making the contraction less important to the overall quantity of goods sold overseas. 

=== Title: This Is How You Can Short Bitcoin - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin’s assault on $10,000 has stirred bears who see fresh evidence of a bubble. There are ways to bet on a crash, but they’re even riskier than trading the cryptocurrency on the way up.
The options to short bitcoin are mostly through unregulated exchanges, and very risky given bitcoin’s volatility. Not to mention it hasn’t exactly been a good year for bitcoin bears given the 10-fold surge in price. But for those daring enough to try, there are ways to bet against bitcoin’s rise.
“All the options to short in common markets are becoming available in the bitcoin market,” said Charles Hayter, co-founder of market tracker CryptoCompare. “There’s pretty good liquidity for shorting bitcoin. The main difference with shorting the Nasdaq for example, is it will be a lot more volatile, so there’s a lot more risk. The rate to borrow will also be a bit higher.”
One of the most popular ways to short bitcoin is through CFDs, a derivative that mirrors the movements of the asset. It’s a contract between the client and the broker, where the buyer and seller of the CFD agree to settle any rise or drop in prices in cash on the contract date.
“CFD is currently a great market if you want to short bitcoin, especially ahead of that milestone 10K mark, which we think will bring some retracement,” said Naeem Aslam, a chief market analyst at TF Global Markets in London, which offers the contracts. “The break could push the price well above $10,100 and it would be in that area when we could see some retracement.”
Another common way to short bitcoin is through margin trading, which allows investors to borrow the cryptocurrency from a broker to make the trade. The trade goes both ways; a trader can also increase their long or short position through leverage. Depending on the funds kept as collateral to pay back the debt, this option increases the already risky bitcoin trade. Bitfinex, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, 
 initial equity of 30 percent of the position.
Short-margin trading positions on Bitfinex were at around 19,188 bitcoins on Monday, versus 23,931 long positions, according to bfxdata.com, which tracks data on the bourse.
Most of the brokerages that allow margin trading will also let clients borrow bitcoin to short with no leverage. This will be a less risky way to bet bitcoin prices will fall.
The futures market isn’t as widely developed as CFDs and margin trading, but it’s still possible to make bearish bets on bitcoin with options. For now, LedgerX is the only regulated exchange and clearing agent for cryptocurrency options in the U.S. The CME Group Inc. and the Chicago Board Options Exchange have both asked for approval to list bitcoin futures, so that may open up the market to more investors.
Investors can also indirectly bet against bitcoin by shorting exchange traded notes with exposure to the cryptocurrency, like Stockholm-based Bitcoin Tracker One, and Grayscale Investments LLC’s 
. The risk is that these notes don’t always trade in line with bitcoin, so the exposure won’t be perfect.
Aslam at TF Global Markets said he’s not seeing an increase in demand to short bitcoin.
“Right now as of this minute, the race is still to the upside,” he said.

=== Title: Bitcoin’s Wild Ride: A Rally, a Rout and Outages on the Exchanges - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin plunged as much as 20 percent hours after a rally past $11,000 generated a surge in traffic at online exchanges that led to intermittent outages.
The plunge capped a wild day for the largest cryptocurrency that included a breakneck advance to a high of $11,434 before the reversal took it as low as $9,009. As of 3:36 p.m. in New York, it traded at $9,911.10, virtually unchanged from where it began the session.
The heaviest selling came amid 
 of service outages and delays on some of the largest online exchanges. The extent of the problems on platforms such as Coinbase and Gemini remained unclear, with several saying massive spikes in traffic had caused unspecified problems. Coinbase remained unavailable to some users.
Bitcoin had rallied 20 percent in just four days, topping $10,000 for the first time earlier this week in a runup that drew increased warnings it was in a bubble. The cryptocurrency ended September at $4,171.25.
“After doubling in such a short period of time, people are taking profits,” said David Mondrus, chief executive of Trive, a blockchain-based research platform. “Issues in the exchanges add to it without a doubt. When you have a lack of ability to exit, then people dump in order to exit faster.”
While not uncommon, outages at online exchanges have 
 led to selloffs in cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, one of the biggest platforms, earlier tweeted traffic was at an all-time high after bitcoin surged to a record $11,434 at 9:11 a.m. in Bloomberg composite pricing.
The cryptocurrency is extremely volatile and susceptible to major dips -- it’s fallen by at least 25 percent on three separate occasions in 2017 already.

=== Title: GM Takes On Ferrari and Lamborghini With the 2019 Corvette ZR1 - Bloomberg ===

Tonight at a party in downtown Los Angeles, Chevrolet unveiled the fastest Corvette ever, the 2019 Corvette ZR1.
It’s also the most powerful street car General Motors has ever produced.
The six-figure coupe comes with a 755-horsepower V8 engine and a top speed of 210mph. That’s more powerful than even Ferrari’s $320,000 F12 and Lamborghini’s $422,000 
. As many as 2,500 will be made, and pricing will start at $119,995. A convertible version will also become available in spring 2018, which will start at $123,995.
Chevy initially unveiled it in Dubai earlier this year, but this is the first time the car will be seen live in North America. The model is the fourth-ever iteration of the ZR1 badge, which ran intermittently in the 1970s and 1990s and early 2000s.
“The car is a move against the supercar landscape. It's the best Chevrolet can do,” said Ron Kiino, the spokesman for GM’s corporate division. “You’re going to have those folks who do have McLarens and Ferraris and Porsches who are drawn to the car for its styling and performance.”
During a year when the LA Auto Show is dominated by primo SUVs and electric-powered concept cars, the ZR1 stands out as one of the most exciting debuts of the show.
Certainly it’s the most exciting debut from Motown at this showcase.
The ZR1 has a new, more-efficient intercooled supercharger system that offers 52 percent more displacement volume than the supercharger on the $80,000 existing Corvette Z06. That helps the ZR1 get at least 100 horsepower more than the Z06 as well. (For context, that’s also 300hp more than the $55,000 standard base version of the Corvette Stingray.)
It also has the option of either a seven-speed manual or eight-speed paddle-shift automatic transmission. It’s the first time a ZR1 has ever come with the possibility of automatic transmission.
That kind performance directly influenced how the ZR1 looks. Most notably, it has an all-new front fascia and a special “halo” hood made from carbon fiber and with an open cut-out in the middle to show off the supercharger itself. That component is raised nearly three inches higher than in previous Corvettes as well, which adds to the visual drama and sense of aggression about the car.
Inside, the two-seater comes with Bose audio, a carbon fiber trimmed steering wheel, and competition sport seats or Napa leather-covered seats with heating and cooling systems as well.
Track-hungry buyers can also splurge on “aero packages” that come with both high and low wings that increase downforce with less drag and assist braking—both which provide for faster lap times.
The new ZTK Performance Package also includes a front splitter with carbon-fiber end caps, Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 summer-only tires, and specific chassis and Magnetic Ride Control tuning for greater cornering grip, plus the adjustable high wing.
Needless to say, those upgrades will be essential for beating those Italian supercars.
The ZR1 goes on sale Spring 2018. 
 

=== Title: Inside Banks, Bitcoin Futures Are Riling Trading Executives - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin is coming to Wall Street on Sunday, and some executives at the world’s biggest banks aren’t sleeping well.
With just a few days left until 
 debuts futures contracts on the cryptocurrency, many banks are still weighing whether to offer them to clients -- and if so, how to handle the mechanics. Several of the largest firms, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., aren’t immediately offering clearing of the futures as they wait to see how it will work, according to people briefed on the plans.
In interviews, some executives and traders said their desks are eager to get in on the action -- but most sounded cautionary notes, ticking off concerns and unanswered questions. Bitcoin’s violent price swings this week have made the new market look all the more dangerous.
All of the people -- speaking from a half-dozen major firms -- asked not to be named, in some cases saying they’re worried about contradicting their bosses’ public statements. Others said it’s still too early to take a position. These are a few of their top concerns: 
Some bank CEOs and industry leaders have spent months deriding bitcoin publicly -- “it’s a 
,” “the very definition of a 
” or an “index for 
” -- and who knows what they’ve said privately. Now, what will it look like if firms help clients into investments that blow up? How might internal commentary over the futures sound if it ever spills into legal cases? One executive, for example, privately referred to the cryptocurrency as “sh*tcoin.”
Enthusiasts say bitcoin is a currency. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission says it’s a commodity. So does 
. So it may seem natural for trading desks in those markets to handle the new contracts. But one executive said there’s at least an argument to be made that equities desks (and delta one traders specifically) are used to the math: Bitcoin is like a volatile stock, and futures, at least in some ways, are like the options that track it.
When asset prices are steady, it’s relatively straightforward for banks to make markets: Help a customer buy or sell an asset, and then take some time to find another client who wants to take an opposite position. But bitcoin is too radioactive for banks to hold -- it swings wildly within minutes and there’s no established model to account for it on the balance sheet. So banks will try to clear the new contracts, matching one investor with another. That can be tough. A few traders, for example, said many clients are only interested in shorting. That can make for a pretty hard day at the office: Without longs, the trades may be costly and hard to set up.
This was laid out in a letter this week from the Futures Industry Association, which said Cboe and larger exchange operator 
 are rushing the futures to market without a proper consideration of the risks. The trade group, made up of some of the world’s largest derivatives brokerages, said it was concerned that the cryptocurrency’s extreme volatility could lead investors to default if prices swing. That could sting firms that clear the contracts.
It’s going to be tough for big bureaucratic banks to figure out all of these mechanics -- and their own stomach for the business -- on a tight schedule. A person close to Goldman Sachs said on Thursday it will initially clear bitcoin contracts for certain clients on a case-by-case basis. Dutch lender ABN Amro Group NV said it will clear the futures for some clients who request specific approval, and said it has received fewer than 10 requests so far.
, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada are in the camp with JPMorgan and 
deciding not to offer clearing right away, people briefed on their plans said. At some other firms, executives said they may enter when ready. So if they do choose to wade in, it’ll be smooth. But will a small presence from big players give an advantage to nimbler, risk-friendly firms that embrace the new market out of the gate?

=== Title: First Look: The Most Powerful Audi TT RS Ever - Bloomberg ===

Today, Audi unveiled the most powerful TT ever, the 2018 Audi TT RS.
The tiny coupe is a mighty effort in badging and so-called "sport packaging," but the engine does pack a legitimate punch. It's a good step forward for the model that first debuted as a bit of a soft little coupe but has quickly ramped up to add serious racing elements. 
The TT RS has a unique five-cylinder engine that gets 400 horsepower and most of its 354 pound-feet of torque from the rear wheels, even though it comes with standard permanent all-wheel drive. (This, thanks to a trademark "electrohydraulic" multi-plate clutch that's positioned for ideal axle load distribution.) The TT RS can hit 60 mph in 3.6 seconds—roughly a half-second faster than a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S. Top speed is 174 mph with an optional sport package.
Audi has done much here to play up the signature five-cylinder sound and gear-shift sequence in this new car. It’s part of the reason why you might buy this TT vs., say, its natural competitors such as the Jaguar F-Type or Porsche Cayman. (The extra RS badges let everyone know it’s the most powerful variant in the TT line.)
As racing enthusiasts will know, the odd configuration of the 2.5-liter engine echoes the original turbocharged five-cylinder that the Audi Ur-Quattro used in the late 1980s.
Other small improvements gird the latest TT: The car is lighter than previous generations, with 57 pounds saved in the engine alone thanks to new aluminum components, and 8 pounds shed via new carbon-ceramic brake discs on the front of the car. Also new this year are Comfort, Auto, Dynamic, and Individual drive modes integrated directly into the seven-speed transmission.
And the new TT RS has optional OLED (organic light-emitting diode) 3D rear taillights that haven’t been available before in a series production car from Audi. The lights—and a large rear-wing spoiler—help the car seem more like a true racer than just the little brother of the 
.
Inside, Audi has added a screen particular to the TT RS that displays information on tire pressure, torque, and G-forces; the colored background of the scale on the screen also prompts the driver to upshift as the car accelerates. Much like the Audi R8 V10, it also has a three-spoke, flat-bottom sport steering wheel with shift paddles and two buttons atop it that allow for engine Start/Stop and Drive Select. 
The car will go to showrooms later this spring. It'll be 
 option from Audi if you want something small, light, and affordable. Pricing starts at $64,900. 
 
 
 

=== Title: Bitcoin Wildness Highlights Worries as Futures Trading Nears - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin’s poised to go legit. Is it really ready?
Three days before Cboe Global Markets Inc., one of the world’s biggest regulated exchanges, debuts futures on the cryptocurrency, it had one of its wildest sessions ever. On Coinbase Inc.’s GDAX exchange, prices zoomed up to almost $20,000 from $16,000 in only about 90 minutes -- then crashed back down. The largest digital currency is still up more than 16-fold this year, trading at 16,126.32 as of 11:52 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg composite pricing.
Coinbase, one of the largest U.S. online exchanges used by investors, temporarily crashed and continued to suffer from service delays. Trezor, a wallet service, tweeted that it’s having “minor issues” with its servers, while Bitfinex, the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, said on Twitter that it has been under a denial of service attack for several days and that it recently got worse.
Cboe and CME Group Inc. last week got permission to offer bitcoin futures. CME’s products launch Dec. 18.
The entrance of Cboe and CME is a watershed for bitcoin because many professional investors have been unwilling to do business on the unregulated platforms where bitcoin currently trades. Cboe and CME are regulated, potentially assuaging those concerns.
Some big traders had just warned about the impending introduction. On Wednesday, the Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- 
 were rushed without enough consideration of the risks.
The group outlined their concerns in an open letter, questioning whether the exchanges would be able to adequately police market manipulation for bitcoin futures. FIA added that the exchanges didn’t get enough industry feedback on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests, and clearing for the products before bringing them to market.
Laurie Bischel, a spokeswoman for CME, declined to comment.
Cboe worked with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to design and improve its contracts and “committed to continue to work closely with the CFTC to monitor trading and foster the growth of a transparent, liquid and fair bitcoin futures market,” according to a statement from the company.
Other trading experts have sounded alarm bells on the possibility of manipulation. The thinking goes that because cryptocurrency markets aren’t policed by a central regulator, cheaters could fly under the radar if they try to move the price of bitcoin on exchanges with scant volume.
The CFTC “has strong anti-manipulation rules for futures, but those won’t necessarily protect investors if the bitcoin cash markets are manipulated,” said Ty Gellasch, executive director of the Healthy Markets Association, an investor advocacy group.
Cboe’s contracts will be based off the price of bitcoin on the Gemini Exchange. CME is using four exchanges, including the Coinbase GDAX market where prices proved so volatile Thursday.
Both Cboe and CME have curbs in place to calm price swings. Cboe halts trading for two minutes if prices rise or fall 10 percent, and a five-minute halt kicks in at 20 percent. At CME, prices aren’t allowed to move more than 20 percent.
The futures appear to be getting a high-profile endorsement. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. plans to clear bitcoin futures contracts for certain clients when the derivatives go live in coming days, according to a person with knowledge of the firm’s plans.
Goldman Sachs, one of the largest firms helping clients buy and sell futures contracts, will act in an agency capacity and won’t serve as a market-maker or build inventory in the derivatives, said the person, who asked not to be identified talking about the plans. The decision to clear client trades will be made on a case-by-case basis, the person said.
“Given that this is a new product, as expected we are evaluating the specifications and risk attributes for the bitcoin futures contracts as part of our standard due diligence process,” Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for the bank, said in an emailed statement.
At Coinbase on Thursday, bitcoin was almost $3,000 pricier than the levels seen on other markets, a record high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The premium reflects surging demand from new investors flooding into the exchange as the fear of missing out on bitcoin’s massive gains this year intensify, said Bryce Weiner, a blockchain developer since 2013. Coinbase has added at least 300,000 users since just before the Thanksgiving holiday and almost tripled its customer base in the past year.
“Coinbase is the biggest consumer-facing exchange,” said Weiner, who plans to launch his own cryptocurrency exchange Alt Market Inc. “The rest of the ecosystem can’t keep up -- that’s how much money is flowing in right now.”

=== Title: Bitcoin Crashes and Then Surges in Wild Weekend Action - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin is proving that investing in digital currencies isn’t for the faint of heart.
After plunging as much as 29 percent from a record high following the cancellation of a technology upgrade on Nov. 8, the largest cryptocurrency came roaring back in early trading Monday before fluctuating between gains and losses.
“Crypto trading is not for the novice investor,” said John Spallanzani, chief macro strategist at GFI Securities LLC in New York.
While multiple reasons are being cited for the price volatility, one of the more viable is that some investors are switching to alternative coins. Bitcoin cash, an offshoot of bitcoin that includes many of the technical upgrades being debated by developers, has more than doubled in the same period.
“We have seen similar steep falls in bitcoin throughout the year -- specifically in June and September -- but every time a considerable decline occurs, new investors jump in to experience the new asset class,” Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at ForexTime Ltd., a currency broker that uses the brand FXTM, wrote in a note Monday.
While markets had been focusing on bitcoin’s more than 500 percent surge this year, bitcoin cash was gaining popularity because of its larger block size. That’s a characteristic that makes transactions cheaper and faster than the original.
When a faction of the cryptocurrency community canceled plans to increase bitcoin’s block size on Wednesday -- a move that would have created another offshoot -- some supporters of bigger blocks rallied around bitcoin cash.
The resulting volatility has been extreme even by bitcoin’s wild standards and comes amid growing interest in cryptocurrencies among 
, banks and fund managers. While skeptics have called its rapid advance a bubble, the asset has become too big for many on 
 to ignore. Even after shrinking as much as $38 billion since Nov. 8, bitcoin boasts a market value of about $110 billion.
Supporters of bitcoin’s technology upgrade “are now switching support to bitcoin cash,” said Mike Kayamori, head of Tokyo-based Quoine, the world’s second most-active bitcoin 
 over the past day. “There’s a panic about what’s happening. People shouldn’t panic. Just hold on to both coins until we see how it plays out.”
The cancellation of last week’s bitcoin upgrade has left users to choose between the two versions of the cryptocurrency. On one side is the original bitcoin, powered by so-called SegWit technology, which aims to improve its performance by moving unessential data off of its underlying blockchain. On the other side is bitcoin cash, which allows its blockchain to handle eight times as much data as the original.
Proponents of bitcoin cash believe their approach is simpler and closer to the original goal of bitcoin, which was described primarily as a payment system in its 
. Supporters of the original bitcoin say that vision is too limited, and that by improving the blockchain with SegWit technology, bitcoin can become a new digital-asset class that not only supports payments but countless other functions.
While bitcoin cash has been around for months, it saw limited support as the community awaited last week’s technology upgrade for the original bitcoin, which promised similar features. Now that the upgrade has been called off, businesses that use the cryptocurrency primarily as a payment method are expected to increase adoption of bitcoin cash.
While bitcoin cash surged over the weekend, it hasn’t been a straight line up. The cryptocurrency was trading at $1,300 at 4:45 p.m. in New York, down from a high of about $2,478 on Sunday, Coinmarketcap.com prices show.
Bitcoin has been similarly volatile; it initially rose after news that it would avoid another split, but the gains were 
. Its plunge earlier Monday to as low as $5,605 compares with an intraday record $7,882 on Nov. 8.
Volume across bitcoin exchanges jumped to 436,021 bitcoins on Sunday, the highest since September, Bitcoinity.org data show. BitMEX, an exchange for cryptocurrency derivatives that allows 
, saw record activity on Sunday, Chief Executive Officer Arthur Hayes said.

=== Title: CFTC Warns of Bitcoin-Futures Dangers, After Allowing Them - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin is going mainstream via the futures market, and the U.S. regulator that allowed it to happen has a message: buyer beware.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a statement Friday detailing “the risks of virtual currency trading” and urged investors to educate themselves before buying into an asset class that has surged more than 1,700 percent this year.
The warning underscores that even as Washington makes it easier for bitcoin to move out of the shadows, worries remain that the mom-and-pop investors who’ve helped fuel its rise have little idea what they’re jumping into. Some of the biggest names in finance have called the digital currency everything from a massive bubble to an outright fraud.
Two weeks ago, the 
 enabled a watershed for bitcoin by announcing that CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc. would start offering bitcoin derivatives: a move that has helped fuel an 80 percent jump in the spot market.
Although the futures products didn’t technically require regulatory approval, the CFTC could have stymied the exchanges’ plans if it wasn’t satisfied with them. The agency let them go forward, and trading on the CME is set to start Sunday after a Cboe contract listed earlier this week. The exchanges got the green light after going through a process called self-certification -- a pledge to the CFTC that the contracts don’t run afoul of the law. 
“Like all futures products, speculating in these markets should be considered a high-risk transaction,” the CFTC 
. “Customers should inform themselves as to how the index or auction prices used to settle the contract are determined.”
In addition to warning about the futures market, the CFTC on Friday also listed dangers on the spot market which include: manipulation, hacking of customer wallets, lack of regulation and volatility.

=== Title: Korean Crypto Exchange Suffers Outage During Bitcoin Cash Surge - Bloomberg ===

Bithumb, one of the world’s most heavily trafficked bitcoin exchanges, is getting heat from customers who were unable to make transactions after its server went down over the weekend.
For about two hours on Sunday, users of the Seoul-based exchange couldn’t make withdrawals and deposits after a sudden surge in usage caused a server connection failure, Bithumb 
 on its website. Trading volume was about 800 percent higher than the October average as prices in some virtual coins experienced wild fluctuations.
The Korean exchange specifically pointed to bitcoin’s lesser-known cousin, bitcoin cash, as the culprit. It’s soared in recent days after key members of the cryptocurrency community decided to call off a software upgrade to bitcoin’s blockchain, leading some investors to rotate into different digital coins.
Bithumb said it canceled some transactions to minimize damage and is having conversations with law firms about how to compensate users who lost money. Frustrated investors who were unable to take advantage of the price fluctuations have joined forces to discuss filing lawsuits against Bithumb, according to local Korean news sites.
This isn’t the first time Bithumb has had problems. In June, customer information was stolen from an employees computer. It also isn’t the first crypto exchange to grapple with performance issues. Coinbase, one of the most popular U.S. exchanges, has faced an 
 of customer complaints this year as it has struggled to keep up with unprecedented volume driven by skyrocketing prices and speculation.

=== Title: Bitcoin’s Digital Cousin Is Disrupting Cryptocurrencies - Bloomberg ===

Just when you thought you had a handle on the newfangled crypto craze, here comes bitcoin cash.
Bitcoin’s lesser-known cousin, the so-called cash version has 
 the $200 billion market and over the weekend got close to overtaking ethereum as the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
The main difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash is the block size. A block is equivalent to a file storing data on approved transactions, which is uploaded and hooked to the previous file, and makes up the blockchain. Bitcoin’s blocks hold 1 megabyte of data, while bitcoin cash holds 8 megabytes.
Supporters of bitcoin cash say bigger blocks allow for faster and cheaper transactions, and view the size increase as the update bitcoin needed to become a better means of exchange to compete with payment services such as Visa or Master Card. Bitcoin handles about seven transactions a second, compared with around 2,000 for Visa.
Bitcoin developers decided to start solving this problem with an update called Segregated Witness, or SegWit, which aims to move some of the work required to check transactions off the main chain, in practice allowing for more data to be stored in each block. While this update was activated in August, most transactions in the bitcoin network are still not using it.
SegWit2x was meant to be the second stage of SegWit and increase the block size to 2 megabytes. Most of bitcoin’s core developers say SegWit should be fully implemented before moving on to other updates. The sides had been locked in disagreement until supporters of the SegWit2x upgrade, which had been threatening to break off from the main chain even if they didn’t have full support, decided to cancel the split last week.
Disappointed supporters of a bigger blocks saw bitcoin cash as an alternative and flocked to it, causing the price to surge to as high as $2,446 on Nov. 12, from around $600 before SegWit2x was called off Nov. 8. The digital asset has since given back some of those gains and is trading at about $1,170 today.

=== Title: Bitcoin Jesus Praises New Coin After $7 Million Wager Falls Through - Bloomberg ===

The man known as Bitcoin Jesus feels like a winner even though he wasn’t able to collect $7 million from a wager with other cryptocurrency evangelists over the success of a now canceled offshoot of bitcoin.
That’s because the version of bitcoin that Roger Ver’s promoting with as much fervor as he once preached in the early days of the original cryptocurrency is on a tear. Bitcoin cash, which sprung from a split from bitcoin in August, has more than doubled to about $900 since an upgrade to the underlying technology was 
 two days ago. Bitcoin is down about 10 percent during the same period.
Bitcoin cash is gaining as traders who were disappointed with the suspension of the so-called hard fork, or split, may view it as an alternative. Both Bitcoin cash and the version known as SegWit2x have larger block size than bitcoin. Ver, who says bitcoin will have to allow for larger block size to speed up transactions and reduce fees, called the cancellation more reason than ever to be bullish on what he calls "the real bitcoin."
Ver’s wager was with Charlie Lee, founder of the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency litecoin, and three others for 1,000 bitcoin. He predicted that new coins resulting from the SegWit2x upgrade would have more value than the original bitcoin. The terms of the trade were that at least 100 blocks had to be mined on the new chain, but that’s unlikely to happen for now after the main proponents of the update on Wednesday said they’re suspending the split to avoid deepening divides in the developer community.
“The way the actual terms of the bet were written is that there have to be at least 100 blocks on the fork in order for the bet to be considered valid and it sounds like that’s not going to happen,” Ver said at a bitcoin meetup last night in Santa Monica, California. He wore a gray blazer with a blue t-shirt underneath that read BCH PLS -- BCH is the symbol for bitcoin cash. “I’m going to use those 1,000 bitcoins to buy more bitcoin cash."
Ver answered questions from the audience of about 200 people for nearly two hours, in what at times felt like a religious revival, with many of the people thanking him for what he had done to promote bitcoin over the years. The house the event was held at resembled a computer coder’s version of a frat house; bare furniture, the guts of computers and wires scattered on counter tops, no toilet paper, and the distinct smell of cat urine in several parts of the house.
Lee confirmed the trade was canceled for now and says he expects bitcoin will continue being the more valuable coin because the August update called Segregated Witness, or SegWit, allows for a better way to make transactions faster, since it takes some of the work off the main chain.
“Bitcoin cash is trying to scale everything on-chain but this doesn’t work for a decentralized system,” Lee said in a telephone interview. “Bitcoin cash is also miner-controlled and miner-centralized. It’s pretty much all sorts of wrong.”

=== Title: North Korea Is Dodging Sanctions With a Secret Bitcoin Stash - Bloomberg ===

North Korea appears to be stepping up efforts to secure bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which could be used to avoid trade restrictions including new 
 approved by the United Nations Security Council.
Hackers from Kim Jong Un’s regime are increasing their attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea and related sites, according to a 
 from security researcher 
. They also breached an English-language bitcoin news website and collected bitcoin ransom payments from global victims of the malware 
, according to the researcher.
Kim’s apparent interest in cryptocurrencies comes amid rising prices and popularity. The same factors that have driven their success -- lack of state control and secretiveness -- would make them useful 
 and money laundering tools for a man threatening to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. With tightening sanctions and usage of cryptocurrencies broadening, security experts say North Korea’s embrace of digital cash will only increase.
“We definitely see sanctions being a big lever driving this sort of activity,” said 
, a researcher at FireEye and author of the new report. “They probably see it as a very low-cost solution to bring in hard cash.”
The 15-member Security Council on Monday approved 
 aimed at punishing North Korea for its latest missile and nuclear tests. U.S. officials said the new measures would cut the country’s textile exports by 90 percent, restricting its ability to get hard currency.
So far this year, FireEye has confirmed attacks on at least three South Korean exchanges, including one in May that was successful. Around the same time, local media reported that Seoul-based exchange Yapizon lost more than 3,800 bitcoins (worth about $15 million at current rates) due to theft, although FireEye said there are not clear indications of North Korean involvement.
North Korea’s telecommunications ministry didn’t respond to an emailed request for comments. The country’s diplomats and official media have denied the country played any role in cyberattacks, including the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014.
North Korea operates what South Korea believes is an army of hackers expanding its focus from military espionage to financial theft. The regime’s Reconnaissance General Bureau, which directly reports to Kim Jong Un, handles peacetime cyber operations from espionage to network disruptions and employs an estimated 6,000 officers, according to a 2016 report from the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
In the recent round of attacks, South Korea may have become a target not just due to its proximity to Pyongyang and shared language, but because the country has become one of the busiest trading hubs for cryptocurrencies this year. Seoul-based Bithumb is the world’s biggest exchange for ethereum. In June, it said hackers had stolen customer information from an employee’s computer, without identifying the attackers.
"As more money goes into cryptocurrency exchanges and more people buy bitcoin and ethereum, exchanges become larger targets for this group,” said McNamara. He said so far he did not have evidence that Kim Jong Un’s regime has targeted cryptocurrency exchanges outside of South Korea, but did not rule out the possibility in the future.
Besides exchanges, FireEye said an English-language bitcoin news website was breached by North Korea, which would likely allow hackers to identify people visiting the site. It declined to name the website and said it believes North Korea prefers larger targets like exchanges than individual owners of cryptocurrencies.
The firm 
 it had found a connection between Pyongyang and the WannaCry attack from May and June, which affected more than 300,000 computers worldwide. McNamara said he also sees indications North Korean hackers are getting involved in cryptocurrency mining.
Attacks on the South Korean exchanges were carried out through so-called spear-phishing attacks, or emailing files laced with malware to specific targets. FireEye identified the malware, known as PEACHPIT, and provided examples of documents it was attached to, including one published by Seoul-based Hyundai Research Institute about the state of bitcoin industries. When contacted, the author of the report confirmed he wrote it in 2014, but was unaware that someone was distributing a press release about it this year.
The group behind the hacks, which FireEye identified as TEMP.Hermit, has made a name for itself out of bitcoin theft, including a 2015 attack on South Korea’s nuclear industry. The hackers have also been 
 by other security firms to last year’s attack on Samsung Electronics Co.’s corporate messenger app and, most prominently, the breach of Sony Corp.’s film studio, which the FBI 
 on North Korea.
"They’re pretty capable actors in comparison to other North Korean activity we see,” said McNamara. "They’ve been creative in how they use their cyber-espionage capability."
The malware used in bitcoin hacks is linked to the group suspected of attacks on the payment systems of global banks last year, according to FireEye. The FBI is also examining North Korea’s link to the theft of $81 million through the New York Fed last year, Bloomberg Markets reported last month.
FireEye said if the hackers wanted to convert bitcoin or ethereum into dollars or won, they’d likely first exchange them into 
 cryptocurrencies like Monero and then into fiat currency. A similar technique was used last month to 
 the bitcoin wallets related to WannaCry.
“They could compromise an exchange and transfer those bitcoins to other exchanges elsewhere in Asia or exchange them for a more anonymous cryptocurrency,” said McNamara. “There are variety of things they could do to cash out.”

=== Title: The Best White Dress Shirts for Men - Bloomberg ===

The plain white shirt is a wardrobe staple, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be plain,
as in boring. Just because it is the most basic of all shirts—the one must-have dress shirt of Western culture and global business—doesn’t mean that it must be basic in the derogatory sense. 
This can be a hard lesson to learn. Some men find it difficult to break the habit of reordering, say, the same tissue-like Van Heusen item that their mothers used to cop at the mall. Maybe you’re stuck in the Brooks Brothers rut. Others are perhaps unfamiliar with options that might provide superior fits for their particular frames, shapes, suit collections, social contexts, and sensibilities.
At a bare minimum, the best white dress shirts enable a guy to conform to written and unwritten dress codes without feeling like a drone. And at their very best, triumphing over vanilla anonymity, they can even help an individual express his individuality. Examine the nine fine specimens below and choose which best suit you.
 
When you want a shirt with the best French cuffs, you head straight to the best French shirtmaker. At

—the company’s characteristically precise stitching comes to bear on this 
. 
 
The details that made 
 button-downs a hit in the 1950s—the box pleat, the locker loop, the rear-collar button—are here. And the suavity of all of them is elevated by the chambray fabric and mother-of-petal buttons.

Balancing the business-dressiness of poplin weave with the more casual pleasures of a button-down collar, this 
 version is the contemporary ideal of a white shirt. The back darts clinch its modern fit. 
 
, the biggest name in outfitting the under-6-foot male, smartly cuts its dress shirts, with their modest spread collars, from pinpoint oxford. Sizes range from 1 (with a 15-inch neck and 31-inch sleeve) to 4x (17-inch neck, 33-inch sleeve). 
 
Because the Stockholm-based shirtmaker 
 gives a crease-resistant finish to this linen-blend fabric, the shirtfront stays as sharp as the angles of its dashing, high, cutaway collar. 
 
In seersucker, with a band collar, the Paris-based 
 gets the win with this summery option. 
 
Doubling down on old-school details, this limited-edition oxford-cloth from Japanese shirt maker

worthy of an Eton schoolboy with a tab collar radiating Ivy League vibes. The mellowness of the oxford-cloth whole balances the daintiness of the details. 
 
Is it possible to wear a white short-sleeved button-down without looking like a

=== Title: Five Easy-Drinking Beers That’ll Be Your Best Friend This Summer - Bloomberg ===

Summer’s most popular beverage? It’s not rosé.
Raise a can, a bottle, and a growler for beer. It is, after all, the quintessential drink in hot weather. And according to Bevspot, beer sales hit their annual high in July and August of 2016, while wine sales were at their lows.
Last year, the brew world’s watchwords were triple IPAs and beer milkshakes—the sort of beers that are defined by an extra-boozy and decidedly rich, more filling, taste. For 2017, the beer world has swung in the opposite direction, opting for quaffable, easy-drinking recipes that are low enough in alcohol to keep you from falling down in the middle of the afternoon.
“This summer, I felt like the right move was to go basic, clean, refreshing,” said Augie Carton, founder of Atlantic Highlands, N.J.-based Carton Brewing. Adam Vavrick, beer director of Publican Family in Chicago, agreed. One of his summer beers is the Boulevard Ginger Lemon Radler. “It’s a blend of lemon soda and beer, with ginger, too,” he said. “It’s low alcohol and incredibly drinkable.” 
Here are five beers to help you avoid the irrational exuberance of the big, hoppy brew when temperatures start to climb.
 
Since it started in 1995, 
 has become one of the country’s defining craft breweries, and founder Sam Calagione recently won the James Beard Award for Outstanding Wine, Beer, or Spirits Professional. Seaquench took two years to develop, the longest Calagione has ever worked on a beer. The alcohol by volume (ABV) is 4.9 percent, and it’s got only 9 carbs and 140 calories per 12-ounce serving. That's a little more than the miniscule 95 calories in a Michelob Ultra, but it comes with a flavor profile that will please margarita lovers and drinkers of pinot gris.
 “As I’ve gotten older, I want a less-heavy, less-fattening beer,” Calagione said. “This is the most thirst-quenching beer that Dogfish has ever brewed, made with lime and sea salt. It’s also the most low-cal and low-carb we’ve ever done. It’s three beers brewed in sequence—a kolsch, a gose, and a Berliner weisse made with lime zest and juice, and is a great all-day beer that doesn’t fill you up. A six pack might not be inappropriate. I can honestly say that it’s one of the fastest-growing beers in the history of Dogfish.”
Carton Boat, the best-selling beer from Augie Carton, described as an IPA “for everyday drinking, when you’re thirsty from softball, fishing, or explaining why your team is best.”
 
 
Chicago’s 
 is famed for its dedication to beer, oysters, and pork, with a special focus on brews from Belgium and Chicago. Its beer director, Adam Vavrick, says the brew to drink this summer is table beer, which comes from the Belgian tradition of low alcohol brews (1 percent to 3 percent ABV) that are made for children and to drink with meals. The enjoyment comes via its subtlety, he says. “This is the year all the breweries are making table beer.”
“I see beer consumers calming down a bit from the ‘irrational exuberance’ of buying every extreme barrel-aged whatever they see. On tap at Publican, I have a hefeweizen from the 
, a monastic brewery in Upper Bavaria, Germany. Hefes are the perfect beer for summer: low-alcohol, soft, and quaffable with an aroma of banana that adds a fruity pop to it.”
 
. “It’s a Radler, so it’s a blend of lemon soda and beer, with ginger, too. It’s low-alcohol and incredibly drinkable. Another is 
. “It’s a Berliner weisse with yuzu added. It’s already zippy and tart; the yuzu adds this gorgeous, fresh citrus flavor that melds perfectly.”
Augie Carton, founder of the 
 based in Atlantic Highlands, N.J., has a day job working in exotic rate derivatives, which “is harder to explain than the fact that cream ale isn’t creamy,” he joked. In his side gig, Carton has garnered a reputation for doing outrageous but delicious styles of beer—for instance, the Shinshu, a miso-spiked cream ale. Beach, Carton's newest brew, will comes out in mid-June; it's a session beer, a low-alcohol beverage said to hearken back to the early 20th century, when British workers were allotted time to drink on the job.
 “Last summer, I made a dry-rubbed, smoked porter called Rub,” Carton said. “I was barbecuing a lot. But this summer, I felt like the right move was to go basic, clean, refreshing. A beer that makes more sense if you drink a couple of them in a row. The Beach is a 4 percent-AVB session beer, a yeast ale made with 3 hops and orange zest. It’s going for a dry crispness, with a drinkable bitterness and citrus. I specifically see you drinking it on the beach.”
 Sundae, another Carton brew. “It’s a Russian imperial stout with freeze-dried ice cream thrown in. It’s made from a beer I made last year, Cosmonaut, aged in cognac barrels with maraschino cherries and walnuts. It’s essentially an ice cream sundae as beer.”
Bay Area brewer 
 is known for hoppy beers, but this year it's highlighting a lighter style. Said Brandon Borgel, the company’s brand manager: “We tried launching Kick Back five years ago, and the market didn’t want it. So now the brewery, with its two-year-old beer garden, Drake’s Dealership—in a former car dealership in Oakland—is re-releasing it for summer. 
 “Fast-forward to now, and it’s a totally different response,” Borgel said. “Kick Back is a sub-5 percent IPA that’s crisp and clean with tropical juiciness and peachy stone fruit. We’re trying to do as many low-ABV beers as we can. We don’t sit around drinking multiple triple-IPAs. Pilsner used to be the lawnmower beer, now it’s supplanted by a session IPA. We call them ‘sessionable,’ because if you say ‘crushable,’ you sound like a frat guy.”
 Foraging Raccoon. “We’re bottling it for the first time. It’s a citrus-forward IPA, a straight-ahead West Coast citrus bomb that’s grapefruit-y and a little pine-y but not over the top, like you just licked a sap tree.”
 
The Brooklyn and Manhattan-based craft-beer destination 
 has a long, deep selection on its menu, as well as a killer reserve list of limited-edition brews. Kyle Kensrue, the bar’s director of operations, said that a return to classic styles started under the radar last year but is now starting to reach critical mass. Vliet Pilsner, from Threes Brewing in Brooklyn, is one of his favorites. “It’s my rooftop go-to,” he said. “I will keep my fridge stocked with this refreshing beer all summer.”  
 “Pilsner has made a big resurgence, especially in New York. A beer like Viet Pilsner is perfect for outdoor gatherings, hiking trips upstate (the can goes with you everywhere), or watching baseball at home on a Sunday afternoon. I love hoppy beers just as much as the next guy, but during the summer, I lean more toward the session side of the styles.”
  Sierra Nevada Otra Vez. “It’s a great beer from one of the best breweries in the country. Slightly tart, with a touch of salt and the refreshing wave of prickly pear cactus and grapefruit. One of the beauties of this beer is that it’s available all over the place. Head to your local beer stop, grocery store, or even bodega, and they’ll most likely have it stocked.”

=== Title: 2017 Audi A4 Allroad Quattro Station Wagon Review - Bloomberg ===

Are you tired of crossovers yet? 
: Last year, sales of large SUV rose by about 
, and entry luxury SUV sales rose by more than 15 percent, while car sales stalled by nearly 20 percent in some segments. 
But if you feel like diverging from the pack, here’s an alternative: The 2017 Audi A4 Allroad. Although the car has been around since 2001, it deserves to be ranked among the small handful of exceptional wagons—the Mercedes E-Class Wagon, BMW 3 Series Sports Wagon, and Volvo V90, among them.
Wagons are strange beasts (though critics 
 them). Born and bred on a car body and platform, they share no engineering DNA from the original truck-based SUVs, but they do have a lengthened rear end for more storage at the back. And in America, at least, they don’t sell in large numbers. Last year, Audi sold 2,300 of these A4 Allroads, compared with 34,687 of its A4 sedan. In January 2017, Audi sold 222, a 49 percent increase over the same period for 2016, but that was still fewer than the e-Tron, Audi’s plug-in hybrid. By contrast, the company’s current bestseller, the Q5 SUV, 
 3,636 units in the same period. 
I drove a $52,625 Audi Allroad last week in New York during the worst snowstorm we’ve had this season and consider it a perfect antidote to wagon-wary buyers. I’ll get to why in a minute, but first a little background.
The low sales figures can be traced to the natural evolution of the American car market since the 1960s. In the 1960s and 1970s, the family car was the station wagon. At the time, the wagons were oblong, unwieldy, embarrassing sloops of metal. They were the only choice for those who needed a vehicle big enough for a family but didn’t want to throw the kids in the back of a pickup.
But by 1980, SUVs had started to emerge. Automakers realized they could sell these high-riding sport utes as the cool, independent 
 choice for families. Pretty soon, they began to dominate with such offerings as the Lexus RX, Chevy Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade, and Chevy Suburban; cool dads and affluent weekend warriors alike could pick these large, utilitarian vehicles without resorting to the wagons that recalled their own nausea-inducing childhood road trips—or worse, minivans, which emerged in 1983 with the Dodge Caravan.
So by the time Audi, Mercedes, and BMW catapulted their own exceptionally sporty wagons into the U.S. in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was too little, too late. There was no chance of mass domination or even the warm embrace of avants, as versions of the wagon are called in 
. Subaru’s Outback and Volvo’s “V” wagons never really left, but those sell to even smaller pockets of enthusiasts who live in mystical places such as Oregon and Maine.
 
I highly recommend the one I drove. The 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine matches the same 252 horsepower and 272 pound-feet of torque as that of the bestselling A4 sedan; the seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission and all-new Quattro all-wheel-drive system are possibly Audi’s greatest accomplishments as an automaker so far.
Plowing through the foot of snow dumped into Manhattan last week proved more of a lark than drudgery. Driving a wagon like this in inclement weather is like letting a Labrador jump in the lake—he’s happiest in his natural habitat. All-season 18-inch tires and electronic stability control come standard, and the $500 Cold Weather Package, which includes heated rear seats and heated steering wheel, is a smart investment.
Compared with its closest competitors BMW and Mercedes, Audi is a young brand in the U.S.—it didn’t start selling massive numbers in America until the 1990s. That’s an advantage in some ways, because staying out of their sales-numbers death match every year (BMW and Mercedes trade top honors every other year or so) allows Audi more freedom to present itself as the option for progressive free thinkers and young spirits.
The interior of the Allroad matches this philosophy. The dashboard is low and slim with lateral vents across the front set off by a high-resolution control screen on top. There’s also a 12.3-inch virtual cockpit behind the steering wheel that shifts from a classic-dial display to a panoramic setting depicting maps, driving systems, and other assistance settings. The overall effect is less fussy than in the Mercedes but softer than in the BMW, a pleasant neutral path.
Sliding into the cockpit of the Allroad feels the same as sliding into that of the A4: Nougat brown leather-wrapped steering wheel; firm, ergonomic seats; a massive panoramic sunroof; three-zone climate control; and privacy glass all come standard. From behind the wheel, combing the exciting performance and the chic, clean interior, you’ll forget this is anything but a sport sedan. I promise.
The moment you open the trunk, though, you will remember this is a wagon. While the back seat is expectedly spacious, and the headroom at both front and back is enough for us tall folks to love, it is the trunk that somehow does that magic thing that great cars do, which is offer more space inside than what an outside cursory glance would guess. And though the cargo space is not quite as large as the BMW in this category, the split-folding rear seatback offers able functionality—it folds flat and wide enough to slide in furniture, appliances, snowboards, or bicycles. (But, really, put those on the roof.) Honestly, when you see the space back here you’ll get giddy imagining all the things you can do with it. I did. 
Fuel efficiency on the Allroad is 23 mpg in the city and 28 on the highway. (It’s an inline four, turbocharged to perfection, remember.) That easily beats the admittedly more powerful E-Class wagon, for instance, and also the next-up-in-size Audi Q3.   
Can you see where I’m going with this? The Allroad represents a thoroughly considered, smart choice compared with the knee-jerk crossover crowd. It’s about belonging to a small group of insiders who 
. Because even though the Allroad wagon isn’t a volume leader for Audi, it does perform exceptionally well, proportionately, for a certain set.
Here’s proof: According to Audi, the Allroad outsold the European equivalent A4 Avant by more than three to one when it was introduced. Consider it good company.

=== Title: World's First Bitcoin Short Notes Allow Bears to Ride Big Swings - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin bears now have another way to bet on price falls.
Swiss structured products houses 
 and 
 started separate products on Friday that allow investors to profit if the price of bitcoin tumbles. Not that it has tumbled much lately. Bitcoin is trading at a record high and has soared more than 700 percent this year.
But the new certificates could usher in more two-way price movement in what has largely been a one-way market so far. Intraday price swings of 10 percent or more are not uncommon in bitcoin trading.
The ability to go long and short paves the way for investors to “take advantage of bitcoin’s significant price swings,” said Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the University of Cambridge.  “The lopsided cryptocurrency investment playing field, historically slanted in favor of long positions, is about to be leveled.”
The certificates, which will be listed on 
 today, come as the cryptocurrency starts to gain mainstream acceptance as a financial instrument after 
, the world’s biggest exchange, said it would start bitcoin futures next month.
“The initial feedback has been extremely positive,” said Manuel Dürr, head of public solutions at Leonteq. “Clients do very much appreciate the possibility of choosing between a long or a short investment in bitcoin.”
Leonteq’s product has a two-month maturity, while Vontobel’s is longer, but in both versions investors can exit early like regular exchange-traded instruments.
The advantage of a mini-future certificate compared with a futures contract is the limited loss potential, Eric Blattmann head of public distribution of financial products at Vontobel, which will launch a short mini future on SIX Exchange on Friday.
“We have seen big demand for our long tracker certificate from investors interested in playing the upside potential of bitcoin, and now they have also the possibility to hedge their position or go short,” Blattmann said.

=== Title: How Alexander Calder Sold the World on Moving Art - Bloomberg ===

The artist Alexander Calder died 41 years ago, but today he seems more famous than ever: In 2017 he’s been featured in four solo exhibitions, and in November no fewer than 31 of his colorful mobiles, massive sculptures, prints, and paintings will be auctioned at Christie’s and Sotheby’s. According to Artnet, his art has gone under the gavel more than 10,400 times; his record sale was set in 2014 at Christie’s in New York, when a hanging mobile went for almost $26 million.
A biography by the art historian and critic Jed Perl, 
, attempts to explain how a single artist could come to so completely dominate the field of American modernist sculpture. The writing practically hums as Perl describes Calder’s work, which he clearly adores, and the text has reams of novel insights: We learn about Calder’s indebtedness to the painter Piet Mondrian—not an obvious connection—and that it was Marcel Duchamp who suggested Calder describe his hanging sculptures as mobiles, a term that came to connote an entire artform. The book’s most illuminating portions highlight how closely interwoven the artist’s social life was with his professional success. Through his connections and his efforts to market his own work, he helped to create, then cement, a type of artistic fame that persists to this day.
Calder was born in 1898 in Lawnton, Pa., into a family of artists. His grandfather, Alexander Milne Calder, sculpted the 37-foot-tall statue of William Penn that sits on the dome of Philadelphia’s City Hall. (We’re told he was haunted until his death by the conviction that the builders had mounted it in the wrong direction.) A. Stirling, Calder’s father, a famous fin de siècle artist, sculpted, among other things, the figure of George Washington that adorns New York’s Washington Square Arch.
Calder himself backed into a career as an artist rather than pursuing one outright—he went to university to study engineering and, only after dragging his heels following graduation, studied at the Art Students League of New York. In 1926 he would move to Paris.
Soon after his arrival, in an attempt to earn some money, he made his 
, a miniature stage set starring tiny circus performers that he could manipulate with wires and strings to do tricks. (The original is in the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.) He held performances in his studio and, eventually, in fashionable drawing rooms in the U.S. and Europe. Socialites would invite him and a coterie of friends, including the sculptor Isamu Noguchi, to operate the 
 during cocktail parties.
Calder’s star began to burn even brighter in 1931, when he married Louisa James, a wealthy grandniece of the author Henry James. Her trust fund largely supported the couple for the next decade. Perl notes, delicately, “The fact that Louisa’s family was well set financially couldn’t have been a matter of indifference to Calder.” By 1933 the couple had moved into a spacious apartment in Paris.
While the rest of the world was plunged into the Depression, Calder and his wife were “coming into their own as hosts,” comfortably entertaining the disparate, immensely important interwar milieu that would shape the world of art and culture for the rest of the century. Over the years, they became friends with Alfred Barr Jr., the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York; Martha Graham, the modern dancer and choreographer; the artist Joan Miró; the playwright Arthur Miller; and dozens of other luminaries.
It’s here where Perl’s book feels particularly thin, clearing Calder of anything as unscrupulous as ambition. He thus brushes aside the possibility that the artist could have been canny enough to use his connections to further his quest to establish a serious position in the art world. So while Perl carefully details Calder’s social gifts and role as expansive host and charming houseguest at English country estates, he discounts any impact it might have had on the artist’s career. “Variations on this portrait of Calder as a sly opportunist reappeared throughout his life,” Perl writes. “The accusations were unfounded.”
The book ends in the early 1940s, when Calder had officially made it. (A second volume, scheduled for publication in November 2019, will address the rest of his life.) By then, his massive mobile, 
, had been installed in the stairwell of MoMA; the Rockefellers had commissioned a candelabra. Later, banking scion Paul Mellon bought cuff links made by Calder. Perl quotes a contemporary who says, “In those days, ‘all the right people’ wore Calder jewelry.”
It takes more than just “the right people” to sustain a 50-year career, of course, and anyone who’s had the pleasure of standing beneath one of Calder’s mobiles can understand the genius it took to transform abstractions into three dimensions. But his transition from a lighthearted tinkerer to ringmaster of Calder Inc. took a lot of help and a surfeit of goodwill. Perhaps Perl’s next volume will make a point to give credit where credit is due.

=== Title: Citadel's Ken Griffin Says Bitcoin ‘Bubble’ May End in Tears - Bloomberg ===

, founder of $27 billion hedge fund Citadel, said today’s bitcoin frenzy resembles Holland’s tulip mania centuries ago.
“Is bitcoin a fraud? No,” Griffin said in an interview Monday on CNBC. “But these bubbles tend to end in tears, and I worry about how this bubble might end.”
The leader of the Chicago-based firm, which makes its money from stock picking and quantitative strategies, said that valuations in the overall market were more stretched now than is typical, driven by low interest rates, low inflation and reasonable growth in revenues.
“We’re in the seventh inning of this market rally,” he said. “But it’s not in the classic mania of a bull market.”
Griffin said that while tax reform for individuals is well thought-out by Congress, lawmakers may be driving the corporate tax rate too low.
“I would have thought we would have landed it somewhere around 25 percent for our corporate rate, not 20,” he said. “But probably not worth splitting hairs over.”

=== Title: Donald Trump’s Ferrari Disappoints at Florida Auction - Bloomberg ===

 he owned a bright red Italian supercar.
President Donald Trump’s 2007 Ferrari F430 F1 Coupe left the sale block before meeting reserve 
 in Florida. Bidding on the car stopped at $240,000, $10,000 below its low estimate. Hours later, the auction house issued a statement saying "we can confirm it exchanged hands just minutes after it left the podium" for a final sale price of $270,000. 
The company did not say who purchased the vehicle and offered no further details about the off-the-record sale. Were it the hammer price, this would have been the most paid for an F430 Coupe with semi-automatic transmission at auction. It had been expected to take as much as $350,000.
Prices can vary widely on this exotic V8, 490-horsepower stallion. RM Sotheby's sold a
 for €459,200 ($490,310) in January in Paris; a 
 sold for $182,600 at a Motostalgia sale in Amelia Island, Fla. And Sotheby's sold a yellow 
 for $357,500 in 2016. Other F430s in various conditions can found 
, for as much as $234,500 and as little as $121,000. 
Pristine, low-mileage versions—especially those with manual transmission or special craftsmanship—hold value better than lesser examples. Trump’s included Daytona-style seats and Scuderia crests on the fenders; it had yellow dials, a radio with a CD changer, and a carbon dash insert.
Other Trump-owned cars have fared better at recent sales.
Trump's 
 took $68,261 at a Bonhams sale last month in England. The total was four to seven times the average value of an American limo from the same era, according to Hagerty data. His 
 took $460,000 in September last year—on EBay. That was 75 percent higher than today's current average price for Diablos.
The low price could have been affected by the fact that the car belonged to a "polarizing" president who used it himself, said Jonathan Klinger, a spokesman for Hagerty.
Trump purchased it new in 2007 and owned it for four years, enough to add on 2,400 miles. (Total mileage is near 6,000.) It’s certainly the only supercar to have been owned by a sitting president. Maybe it would have been worth more if Trump 
 owned it. (The car was offered to the auction house by its second and current owner.)
“The appeal is slightly lower than if [bidders] were buying the car directly from Trump,” Klinger said.
In fact, most sales of presidential memorabilia come after a former chief executive's death. Last year, a pair of cowboy boots 
 carried a high estimate of $20,000 but sold for $199,500; 
 of the Berlin wall signed by Reagan sold for $277,500. It had been expected to take $20,000.
Today's results (and unfortunately for 
) also add evidence that the F430 is not necessarily a superior investment, something the vintage car market has shown for some time. Average values at auction for this model have fallen 15 percent over the last five years, according to Hagerty, hovering near $120,000 to $130,000 for a car with an F1 (paddle-shifter) gearbox. The original MSRP ranged from $185,000 to $215,000.
The gearbox is key to holding value, Klinger said, specifically whether a car has a true manual transmission vs. the six-speed paddle-shifter in Trump’s Ferrari. 
“I would expect the cars with the F1 gearbox, like this one, to continue to depreciate for the near future,” Klinger said.
“These were some of the last Ferraris available with manual transmission, making them worth considerably more than the F1 cars,” Klinger continued. “A manual car is worth somewhere from 50 to 75 percent more than the F1 gearbox cars.”
 
 
 
 

=== Title: Paying $15 to Send $25 Has Bitcoin Users Rethinking Practicality - Bloomberg ===

Ryan Charles recently switched his business, the social platform Yours Inc., from using bitcoin -- simply because he couldn’t afford it.
Fees for sending money over the distributed-ledger network have risen nearly 
, from 13 cents per average transaction in the second quarter of 2016 to $2.40 in the same quarter of this year, according to researcher CoinDesk. While they’ve moderated somewhat since, the fees still undermine the San Francisco-based company’s business model, which is built around writers receiving small payments from readers of their posts.
"Bitcoin is now in a situation where the fees are very high and are likely to continue to increase, so it’s not even competitive with PayPal or Western Union in most cases," Charles said in a phone interview. 
When bitcoin debuted in 2009 it was hailed as a technology that would revolutionize the world of finance by making micro-payments practicable, and international money transfers cheaper than Western Union Co. In some cases, particularly in low-value transactions, fees to run payments over the blockchain technology based network can actually be higher.
The fees go to so-called miners, whose computers run the software that makes the network tick. Miners didn’t suddenly raise prices. The bitcoin blockchain is a supply-and-demand-driven system. When there’s lots of demand, users have to pay higher prices for transactions to post fast. They can pay lower fees, but then the payments will get a low priority, and postings could take days. Most consumers don’t even know about the low-cost option: They simply pay fees imposed by what are known as wallet companies that facilitate transactions. And fees have been spiking often.
That’s making bitcoin impracticable for many people. Nearly 60 percent of the world’s bitcoin owners hold less than $4 at current prices, according to 
. At the recent average of $2.46 per transaction on the bitcoin blockchain, the fees would swallow most of the funds. On Aug. 22, the average transaction fee was $8.90, according to Lucas Nuzzi, senior analyst at Digital Asset Research.
For many companies hoping to do commerce via bitcoin, the fees are prohibitive, especially in emerging economies like India and Vietnam, where consumers often earn a few dollars a day. Even U.S. residents can feel the burn. It can cost as much as $15 to send $25 from the U.S. to a bank account in the U.K. via bitcoin, or three times as much as using Western Union, Nuzzi said.
"It’s very cumbersome and complicated,” said Khalid Fellahi, head of Western Union Digital in San Francisco. “We haven’t seen that today being an alternative to what we do.”
To send the $25 from the U.S., Nuzzi used a credit card to buy an equivalent amount of bitcoin on exchange Coinbase Inc., which charged a 3.99-percent fee this month. Then he paid a bitcoin network fee of $1.34 to send the payment to the U.K. While converting bitcoin to pounds was free on the exchange Coinfloor, Nuzzi had to pay $13.56 to place the money in a U.K. bank account. He ended up paying $15.90 to get the payment through.
Granted, some users don’t convert to a fiat currency, and transact in bitcoin directly. But even those users would pay fees to miners.
"Bitcoin cannot be used properly for commerce when a transaction costs more than $2," said Shaun Chong, lead developer of mining community Bitcoin.com Pool, which makes between 10 percent and 30 percent more in revenue now that the fees are higher.
"If the fees were lower, the bitcoin price would be even higher because bitcoin would be more usable," Chong said, adding that in its current state, the network is "broken."
There are several reasons why network fees are so high. Many startups have been requiring investors to pay in bitcoin for Initial Coin Offerings. Since those were often only open for a limited period of time, investors sped up money transfers to avoid missing out, pushing costs higher, said Nuzzi.
What’s more, as bitcoin’s profile rose, the network often got overloaded. With demand high, and supply short, transaction prices went up.
Some of the fees may decline in time. Developers are working on different ways of expanding the network’s capacity, with one major fix implemented in late August, and another due in a few months.
But bitcoin developers remain split over how to improve capacity. Already, some of them decided to create and run a separate bitcoin-like digital ledger called bitcoin cash earlier this year. And another split off could be coming in 
. Even if the most promising solution, called 
, is implemented, fees could remain high as demand increases, said Charles. That’s why he switched to bitcoin cash, which charges lower fees.
"We see bitcoin losing market share in comparison to other currencies if more events like that spike network fees," Nuzzi said. There are around 1,000 digital currencies and nearly all of them charge lower transaction fees than bitcoin right now. So some entrepreneurs and users are moving to litecoin, bitcoin cash or ethereum to find better prices.
"Bitcoin has a lot of value in terms of moving large amounts of value using digital currency," said 
, chief executive officer of cryptocurrency exchange operator Circle Internet Financial Ltd. "The fees don’t matter when you are dealing with larger transactions. If you are using it for a $25 transaction –- then yeah, the fees would be too much."
As transactions get more expensive, perceptions of what bitcoin is are changing, too. Because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin issued, it’s considered to be a scarce resource that investors can park money in, hoping for appreciation. Already, bitcoin’s price has nearly quadrupled this year, despite pressure from Chinese regulators.
"It’s forced bitcoin into moving away from being a cheap payment system to being a store of value like digital gold," said Anthony Di Iorio, founder of digital wallet provider Jaxx.

=== Title: Bitcoin's Surge Prompts U.S. to Police It Like Other Commodities - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has moved it out of the shadows of finance. The latest sign that its becoming part of the mainstream came Friday when a key U.S. agency proposed that trading be regulated much like other commodities.
Specifically, the 
 made clear to market participants that there could be penalties if they can’t show buyers can take physical control of purchased digital coins in 28 days -- a framework that already applies to wheat, oil and gold.
The long-existing rules that require traders and exchanges to be able to deliver physical commodities has sowed some confusion for bitcoin because it’s an asset class that exists only in cyberspace. What makes the issue even more complicated is that many investors are amplifying their bets with margin, or borrowed money.
Bitcoin has jumped more than 1,700 percent in 2017, captivating everyone from retail investors to Hollywood celebrities. The digital currency has advanced 82 percent this month alone, a rise fueled by the CFTC’s decision to allow bitcoin futures to begin trading on exchanges run by CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc.
In its 
, which the CFTC will seek public comment on for 90 days, the regulator said that if a trader can’t take possession of a virtual currency bought on margin within about a month, the transaction will be treated as a futures contract. Futures contracts are subject to strict CFTC oversight, and failing to register them could subject firms to fines.
The CFTC’s proposed guidance could apply to U.S. exchanges or transactions overseas involving Americans.
“The commission regulates retail commodity transactions, with the exception of contracts of sale that result in actual delivery within 28 days,” the CFTC said in a 23-page document. “The commission considers virtual currency to be a commodity.”
The CFTC said it has faced questions about its views on the delivery of bitcoins since it 
 Bitfinex, one of the biggest digital token markets, last year.
The regulator said Bitfinex broke the law because digital coins weren’t provided to buyers in the required time frame. Instead, the platform “held the purchased bitcoins in bitcoin deposit wallets that it owned and controlled,” according to the CFTC. Bitfinex agreed to pay $75,000 to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations.
Friday’s proposal is the latest move by the CFTC to police virtual currencies, whose surge this year has largely caught regulators 
. CME, the world’s biggest exchange operator, plans on Monday to begin offering cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts. Earlier this month, the regulator said it would allow the CME contracts to start trading, as well as futures from Cboe, after they pledged that the products don’t run afoul of the law.

=== Title: Bitcoin Shorts Retreat in Sign Selling Pressure Could Be Easing - Bloomberg ===

Bearish investors in bitcoin have started to cover their short positions, suggesting selling pressure may be waning after concern over the cryptocurrency’s future wiped out some 
 in value in the past week.
Short positions on Bitfinex -- the world’s 
 cryptocurrency exchange -- were at around 9,300 bitcoins ($59 million) on Monday, according to 
, which tracks data on the bourse. That’s about a third of the roughly 28,000 bitcoin shorted as of Nov. 7, before a surprise decision to cancel a 
 that prompted some users to switch out of bitcoin in favor of rival bitcoin cash.
The current short positions are the lowest since July, right before tensions soared ahead of a divisive split that resulted in the birth of bitcoin cash. Back then, the contracts dropped to a low of 6,000 bitcoins, before soaring to a record 43,000 bitcoins, according to bfxdata.com.
Meanwhile, traders betting on gains have increased their long positions to 23,000 bitcoins as of Monday, from 18,000 bitcoins a week ago. On Monday, the digital currency was down 2.7 percent in late Asian trading.

=== Title: 2017 BMW 5 Series Review: Perfect Details You Didn't Even Notice - Bloomberg ===

BMW has made its 5 Series sedan since 1972.
It is the company’s second-bestselling model, after the 3 Series. This is quite a feat, considering that passenger cars (as opposed to SUVs and pickup trucks) composed 39 percent of the car market last year, down from 43 percent in 2015 and as much as 52 percent in 2012.   
In the current automotive landscape, 
.
But the 5 Series and its rival sedans—the more homogenous Audi’s $47,600 A6 and heftier Mercedes-Benz’s $52,150 E-Class—have something the fresh-faced sport utes don’t: longevity. And the seventh-generation version of this six-cylinder 335-horsepower sedan, codenamed G30, has lasted so long because it excels at getting the little things right.  
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG has long been rightly acknowledged for crafting superior chassis, suspension, and handling. But the Bavarians have been a little behind on the technology front—early versions of its iDrive 
 for coming up short on what drivers actually needed. Meanwhile, since the early 2000s, Daimler AG's Mercedes unit has led the pack with progressive innovations.
BMW has been working furiously to narrow that gap, and this year's 5 Series offers a surround view system with 3D view exterior cameras. The system uses four cameras that work together to create three-dimensional views of the space surrounding the vehicle. The effect is that you can see obstacles in the entire vicinity, not just slivers of it, including things so low as curbs. When I drove the 540i last week in New York, I was transfixed. It’s like watching a movie of your actual drive. After using it, anything less feels vastly inferior.
Yes, everyone has rear-view cameras, but the ones in this car are better thought-out in how they show the car and its surroundings. The screens are clearer. The angles of the camera shots are better. Heck, the whole thing is slightly angled to please the driver first.   
What’s more, this technology is displayed on a new, 10.3-inch display touchscreen that syncs with features that you can control with buttons on the steering-wheel and center console. It's also sensitive to voice commands and hand gestures (results may vary), and even the top of the iDrive knob, which has a touchpad on it.
This is perhaps the best setup in the game, not because it’s revolutionary, but because it executes the little things well. (It’s the system BMW's Rolls-Royce subsidiary also uses.)
BMW excels at painstaking attention to details that add up make this sedan striking in a sea of ho-hum contenders.
The challenge when driving—and writing about—midsize luxury sedans is that they are ubiquitous, innocuous, and frequently bland in style and temperament. They are the cars you buy so you don’t get accused of being ostentatious. It’s difficult to find anything about them—good, bad, or otherwise—outside the lines.
That is also the reason for their popularity. A $56,450 car such as the 2017 BMW 5 Series 540i I drove last week in New York allows you to possess something precious without inciting class warfare. The BMW 5 Series is why we can have nice things. (In fact, at $82,610 with upgrades, the one I drove was 
 nice.)
This car won’t leap out at first glance, but here’s what to look for on the second: the way the crenellations on the hood are slightly pinched compared with previous models, making it look just a bit leaner; the way the body is made of high strength steel, magnesium, and aluminum, which means it’s lighter and stronger than products made from mere aluminum and steel.   
New this year is an etch along the lower part of the sides, which you'll notice the way you come to appreciate a new set of abs after you’ve been working out a while. The door height and handles are positioned and weighted for perfect entry; you don’t even notice getting into and out of the car.
What’s more, the adaptive LED lights (larger than in previous years) complement slightly larger kidney grilles that now contain automatic shutters for the first time, helping move air around the car for improved aerodynamics and therefore, improved efficiency. It’s a small change, that grille engorgement, but it makes the car just that much more memorable.
The bottom line: While the Audi’s gaping grille may be more noticeable on the street, the 5 Series as a whole, with its structured body and bulging hood, is the more chiseled option in the segment.
In this midsize luxury sedan segment, a place potentially as sexy as the floor of a movie theater, details matter—especially details that feed the five senses. The 540i has many, beginning with the sound of the improved soft-close automatic doors. The Dakota leather trim (richer, softer) smells like a saddle shop, and will keep its scent for months. The way the rear-view mirror gently auto-dims after you turn off the car will satisfy you like the last pop in a sheet of bubble wrap. 
And the new, optional, 20-way ergonomic seats, which can inflate to change from bucket-style racing seats to plush loungers, will make even mother happy.
I also loved the full-color, heads-up display. This technology is nothing new—except this version was clearer and 75 percent larger than in previous generations. This was noticeable, and it mattered. The controls on the center console, set squarely around the center dial, were big, easy to use, and clearly labeled. Dare I say foolproof? I daren’t, but still.
The interior is the part of the car we directly interact with, so it’s essential to get it right. Apart from the actual driving experience, the mood set in the cabin most closely reflects the caliber of the car.
Germans … uh, German 
… can be cold. This one is warmer than most.
Now for the good stuff. Driving the 540i provides a lesson in proper German engineering. As it picks up from the lower of its eight gears to topping out in sport mode, the balance of the car's lighter weight (BMW claims to have shaved 137 pounds from previous models) and renewed connection on its now-standard run-flat tires harmonize beautifully, better than in previous years.
Why? We now have an upgraded dynamic handling package and an M Sport package ($2,600) that is lowered. We also have a newly stiffened suspension; adaptive drive mode, which automatically adjusts the electric power steering and automatic transmission to your driving style and road conditions; and optional integral active steering, which combines rear-wheel steering with variable-ratio steering up front. That means the steering becomes quicker the more you wind the wheel, even as it remains consistent in velocity. This all makes for a more predictable car.
Predictable, yes. But not boring.

=== Title: Bitcoin Exchange Sees Complaints Soar - Bloomberg ===

The most popular online exchange for trading digital currencies is generating a surge in customer complaints this year even as investors are lured by a dramatic rise in prices.
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has received at least 293 complaints about Coinbase Inc., according to 
 reviewed by Bloomberg. That compares with about six complaints for all of 2016, and makes Coinbase the biggest recipient of CFPB virtual currency complaints this year. The website has struggled to keep up with spiking volume and longer transaction processing times as the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies soared to record highs.
More than a third of the grievances came from individuals who said they were unable to access their money when promised. Many people also complained about other transaction or service problems. Accusations of fraud represented less than 15 percent of the complaints.
"The funds were supposed to be transferred to my checking account within three-to-five business days," one customer complained to the CFPB in May. "I need the money."
Megan Hernbroth, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Coinbase, declined to comment on the CFPB complaints.
Since the beginning of 2017, the CFPB has received more than 250 complaints under the "virtual currency" category. About 60 percent of those were directed at Coinbase, while many of the others were aimed at 
 and large banks.
Coinbase, which was founded in 2012, said in June that it’s working to improve customer support. The exchange has grappled with a slew of 
, including outages, slow load times and a 
 in ether, the second most valuable virtual coin.
"Over the past few months, we’ve seen an unprecedented increase in the number of customers signing up to use Coinbase," wrote the company’s co-founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong, in a June 6 
. "As a result, our systems have been pushed to the limit. This has caused many customers to have a negative experience."
On its 
, Coinbase says transaction timing can vary depending on a customer’s location and payment method, and U.S. bank transfers can take up to five business days.

=== Title: How to Flawlessly Pull Off Sneakers with Your Suit - Bloomberg ===

See the guy on the subway platform with his gray suit and New Balance running shoes, which—like Melanie Griffith in 
—he wears exclusively for his commute? Or see the eminent graybeard in your workplace, the gentleman who believes, with some justification, that he has earned the right to wear a dark pinstriped suit with an especially horsey pair of Under Armour SpeedForm Geminis?
OK, forget those guys, because they’re doing things ineptly.
Once upon a time, the suit-and-sneakers combo was primarily adopted by narrow subsets of the male population, such as self-conscious rebels wearing Converse Chuck Taylors to homecoming dances. Also, victims of chronic ankle pain.
But no longer. “Sneakers with a suit is the big trend right now,” says Loris Spadaccini, vice-president in charge of the men’s division at M. Gemi, which sells Italian shoes directly to consumers. “It’s accepted even in traditional business environments.” He ventures further that the craftsmanship of high-end shoemakers—“our uppers are not glued but stitched to the sole”—has helped to facilitate the acceptance. 
Now, instead, look at this trendy young guy with the hem of the tiny trousers of his bright blue suit hovering a full three inches above the green heel tabs of his box-fresh Adidas Stan Smiths. You can quarrel with the tailoring, but the guy is on to something. The relaxed jackets of the moment, with their 
, are mainstreaming the sneakerhead ethos to memorable effect.
Consider the testimony of Sébastien Kopp, who 12 years ago co-founded the French sneaker company Veja. “When we created the brand, we never imagined someone wearing sneakers with a suit,” Kopp says. “But we’ve seen it across the board, from businessmen to artists to TV personalities. It works best when the shoe pops and is quite visible. It shouldn’t be subtle, but rather make a statement.”
Well-dressed men intuit this, as I discovered the other day loitering on West 55th Street and watching Midtown Manhattan power-lunchers of a certain age exit Michael’s. The flashy casual kicks worn by those executives and aspirants confirmed that we have plunged feet first into a new era.
They tended to observe what is, though not an ironclad law, a smart guideline: Use contrast to make a suit-with-sneakers outfit sing. Their sedate medium-toned suits were paired with sneakers that split the difference between wine-dark opulence and pumpkin-bright flamboyance, sporting what looked like 
 with the intrecciato motif, rich brown 
 with a similar weave, and ultra-lightweight, napa-calf low-tops from 
. 
Spadaccini specifically advocates for the white sneaker to go with a blue suit: “We like this idea of high contrast to make footwear the centerpiece of the outfit,” he says. It’s a low-degree-of-difficulty move: Match the resort-hotel airiness of a perforated leather court shoe against the citified solidity of a solid suit.
A somewhat riskier—and, therefore, potentially more rewarding—move is to juxtapose the earth tones of khaki with the space-suit silver gleam of metallic trainers. And though high tops can be highly tricky in this arena, a pair will perfectly accessorize with a skinny dark suit in certain contexts, such as overpriced nightclubs and televised music-industry award shows.
In the best such pairings, the sneakers in play are proud of their 
, I believe. They might be elevated—by way of the quality of the leather, the stitching, the shoelaces—and they might be minimalist, with a light touch on multicolored trademarks and lavish logos. But they don’t shy away from being, in a fundamental way, sneakers. 
Ironically, a sneaker that too closely resembles a dress shoe looks worse in most cases. A black slip-on sneaker, for example, can sometimes assume the sad aspect of an orthopedic loafer.
Once you embrace the spryness of the ensemble, you can explore the versatility of the look. Years ago, on the day of my bachelor party, I wore a seersucker suit, a blue polo shirt, and a pair of Adidas Rod Lavers from the Belmont Stakes to Wolfgang’s Steakhouse. You can go anywhere in such an outfit—and go there faster than you can in other kinds of shoes. I suggest trying a lightweight suit with a flashy pair of kicks at a beach wedding, where you’ll appreciate the extra traction, especially if you get cold feet and sprint away from the altar at the last second.   

=== Title: Biggest Crypto Exchanges Hit by Delays With Demand Surging - Bloomberg ===

Investors fearful of missing out on the frenzy in digital currencies are being greeted with service outages and delays on some of the largest online exchanges.
Coinbase tweeted that traffic on its platform was at an all-time high with bitcoin surging past $11,000 earlier today, eight times the peak demand experienced in June. Gemini 
 it addressed performance issues after receiving complaints. GDAX said it resolved log-in problems, while Bitstamp tweeted that it resolved an issue with users not receiving confirmation emails. The latter 
 that a delay on the bitcoin network may be to blame.
Nearly all exchanges have had to grapple with periodic outages and performance issues during the more than 10-fold increase in bitcoin and the rise in the value of other digital currencies this year. Coinbase has experienced outages, slow load times and a June flash crash in ether, the second most valuable virtual coin.
The number of accounts at Coinbase, which serves as a platform for trading bitcoin and rivals such as ethereum, had almost tripled to 13 million in the past year, Bespoke Investment Group LLC said earlier.
“While some users may have suffered from slower performance, much of the site was unaffected,” David Farmer, Coinbase’s director of business operations, said in a statement. Service “should be fully resolved in the next couple of hours."

=== Title: Bitcoin, Ether Lead Digital Currency Slide From Highs - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin declined as much as 17 percent, while smaller competitor ether continued to slide after experiencing a “flash crash” last week, raising concern about mainstream acceptance of the digital currencies.
Bitcoin slumped to as low as $2,255.44 in intraday trading, the least since June 15. Ether, the virtual currency based on the ethereum blockchain, plunged 26 percent to $221.45, according to data compiled by Coindesk.com. And ripple, the third largest digital currency based on market cap, has dropped about 13 percent to around 26 cents, according to 
.
Ether slumped June 21 after congestion on its network slowed transactions, causing some cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitfinex and ShapeShift to halt transactions. Coinbase’s GDAX exchange experience a "flash crash," as price slippage sent ether to trade around 10 cents, said GDAX Vice President Adam White, who on Monday decided to 
 not to refund flash-crash victims. He said the crash on GDAX was instigated by a multimillion-dollar market sell order.
The two biggest digital currencies have still surged in value this year. Ether started the year around $8, meaning even with its current drop, the price has doubled many times over. Bitcoin has advanced about 150 percent year to date.
"When people fixate on price movements over a single day, my recommendation is zoom out of the price chart and look at the broader trend," said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a Washington-based nonprofit research firm focusing on cryptocurrencies. "Blockchain could either catch on as the rails for global finance, or not, so valuations for a digital currency like bitcoin can either go to zero or be worth much more than it is today, so these assets are bound to be very volatile as people’s calculations of what they are worth can be all over the map."
Coinbase was down earlier Monday, according to online forums on ether, which could explain some of the losses, as this comes after other exchanges temporarily suspended trading last week due to a bottleneck on ether orders.
The steeper decline in ether than bitcoin means ether’s market cap at $25 billion is now just about 60 percent of bitcoin’s, down from about 80 percent, when ether climbed over $400 two weeks ago. The rapid growth of the ethereum network had prompted speculation that ether would overtake bitcoin to become the biggest cryptocurrency as soon as this year, a phenomenon known as the flippening.
Chipmakers that had benefited from cryptocoin miners last week are now giving up some of those gains. 
 dropped for the third consecutive day, slumping 1.1 percent to $152.15 per share. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. dropped 0.6 percent to $14.08.

=== Title: Cybersleuths Unearth More Clues Linking WannaCry to North Korea - Bloomberg ===

Cybersecurity researchers at 
 and 
 have uncovered more evidence tying this month’s WannaCry global ransomware attacks to North Korea.
The cyberattack that infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide was “highly likely” to have originated with Lazarus, a hacking group linked to the reclusive state, Symantec said. The software used was virtually identical to versions employed in attacks earlier this year attributed to the same agency, the company said in a 
 late Monday.
FireEye on Tuesday agreed WannaCry shared unique code with malware previously linked to North Korea. “The shared code likely means that, at a minimum, WannaCry operators share software development resources with North Korean espionage operators,” Ben Read, a FireEye analyst, said in an emailed statement.
North Korean diplomats and official media have denied in recent days that the country played any role in the attacks.
WannaCry, the malware behind a global 
 dubbed “unprecedented” by Europol, infected an estimated 200,000 computers worldwide, infiltrating global institutions from the the U.K.’s National Health Service to FedEx Corp. and 
 It gave its victims 72 hours to pay typically $300 in bitcoin or risk permanent loss of data. As of last Friday however, the estimated total amount of ransom paid failed to hit six figures.
The initial attack was stifled when a security researcher disabled a key mechanism used by the worm to spread, but experts said the hackers were likely to mount a second attack because so many users of personal computers with Microsoft operating systems couldn’t or didn’t download a security patch released in March labeled “critical.”
Last week, a Google researcher posted on Twitter that an early version of WannaCry 
 some of the same programming code as malicious software used by Lazarus, the alleged North Korean government hackers behind an attack on Sony Corp. in 2014 and the theft of $81 million from a Bangladeshi central bank account at the New York Fed last year. 
Other researchers have speculated that if the perpetrators were indeed North Korean, their intent may have been to cause a widespread internet outage to coincide with a scheduled missile test.
“Despite the links to Lazarus, the WannaCry attacks do not bear the hallmarks of a nation-state campaign but are more typical of a cybercrime campaign,” Symantec wrote in its report.

=== Title: Bitcoin Surges on Hopes That Upcoming Split May Be Avoided - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin soared to a record after a technology upgrade that was threatening to disrupt the biggest cryptocurrency was called off, removing another concern for mainstream investors captivated by this year’s more-than-sevenfold gains.
The virtual currency jumped as much as 11 percent to $7,882 after the main architects behind a change to its underlying software, known as SegWit2x, canceled their controversial plans, saying they wanted to avoid deepening divides in the developer community.
Bitcoin developers, users and miners -- those running computers that crunch the complex math required to verify transactions -- have been trying to agree on ways to make transactions faster, as the network’s growing popularity has led to congestion. After an initial upgrade in August known as SegWit, short for Segregated Witness, a group in the bitcoin community was calling for SegWit2x. The second upgrade hadn’t gained as much support and was only a week away from confronting bitcoin with one of its hardest tests ever.
"Uncertainty is gone, Wall Street is going to hit hard," Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, said in an email. "Short term, expect bitcoin to keep pumping."
Bitcoin has climbed from about $6,00O since CME Group Inc., the world’s largest exchange owner, said on Oct. 31 that it wants to offer bitcoin futures by the end of the year, only a month after dismissing such a plan. Cboe Global Markets Inc. said in August that it wants to sell futures. Both need approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 of the digital currency ranging from billionaire Warren Buffett to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon have warned that the unregulated asset is a speculative bubble in danger of bursting.
SegWit2x’s goal was to double bitcoin’s blocksize to two megabytes, which in practice increases speed and reduces fees. While most miners and many businesses 
 the change, many of bitcoin’s core developers opposed it, leading to bitter and public fights, including a 
 of 1,000 bitcoin between Roger Ver, an early investor in bitcoin who is known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” and Charlie Lee, the founder of the fifth-largest digital coin, Litecoin.
In interviews before the upgrade was called off, Ver said users should be "excited because it makes bitcoin faster and cheaper" and called opponents a "loud and vocal minority," while Lee said the change "could destroy the faith of bitcoin as a cryptocurrency."
The lack of consensus meant the upgrade couldn’t be implemented without breaking the chain. The main proponents of SegWit2x said in a 
 Wednesday they decided to call off the hard fork because of this reason.
“Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time,” developers and industry leaders including Jeff Garzik, Jihan Wu and Wences Casares wrote.
Users worried about potential disruptions the upgrade could cause as SegWit2x, unlike previous forks like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, didn’t have so-called replay protection. This means it might be possible to run the same transaction through two networks. Exchange Coinbase planned to disable trading of bitcoin for eight hours before the fork, for example.
Bitcoin had rallied after the Bitcoin Cash fork didn’t cause any problems on the main network. Bitcoin Cash, which allows for bigger block size, is now trading at $587. Bitcoin Gold, another digital asset that split from bitcoin, now trades at $140.
“There was definitely risk involved so, in that respect, it’s great to have that risk taken off the table -- at least for now,” said Spencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital LLC. “It would have been great for bitcoin to prove its resiliency once again and to strike this scenario off the ‘fear list.’ Overall though, the cancellation of the 2x fork highlights bitcoin’s resiliency and reaffirms bitcoin’s status as the honey-badger of money."
SegWit2x 
 had been trading at around $1,500 yesterday, signaling it still didn’t have enough support to overtake bitcoin. They’ve plunged to $278.
That said, some industry insiders say bitcoin developers may still need to implement SegWit2x at some point -- perhaps next year, Meltem Demirors, director of Digital Currency Group, said in a tweet Wednesday.
But as the uncertainty and the infighting around the hard-fork was lifted at least temporarily, it clears the way for institutional investors preparing to enter the space, with bitcoin derivatives and even exchange traded funds potentially on the way.
“When you have toxic conversations on Twitter between CEOs of large companies involved with bitcoin, it turns off mom and pop users because nobody needs drama in their life,” said David Mondrus, chief executive of Trive, a blockchain-based research platform. “It also turns off money. Institutional investors have concerns about trusting 25-year-olds writing code who can’t even be civil to each other.”

=== Title: WannaCry-Linked Bitcoin Wallets Have Been Emptied, Analysts Say - Bloomberg ===

The three Bitcoin wallets that are linked to the WannaCry malware, which hit hundreds of thousands of networks using 
’s operating system in 150 countries, were emptied out earlier this morning, analysts have confirmed.
In each of the cases, the tokens have been divided into multiple smaller amounts, and sent off to other, various bitcoin addresses. The wallets contained a total of about 52 BTC, which amount to around $140,000, explained Rayna Stamboliyska, an independent cyber risk manager in an email. "This morning, between 3:00 and 3:30 AM GMT, the three wallets have been emptied and the money split into further ones," she said.
In May, large-scale ransomware attack dubbed WannaCry 
 to about 300,000 computers in 150 countries, where access to data was blocked unless a ransom was paid through bitcoin. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service, 
, 
 and 
 were among entities impacted. The fallout for European companies 
 has proven costly.
Orla Cox, director of security response at Symantec, said there is no way of knowing whether it was the WannaCry attackers, or even law enforcement, that accessed the three Bitcoin addresses. "These addresses may not represent all of the attackers’ earnings as WannaCry can generate unique bitcoin addresses per infection."
Stamboliyska said the money may have been moved in an effort to obscure its origins, much like laundering. "The whole transaction lot is, however, still fresh, so we digital investigators will need some time to follow these breadcrumbs."
Indeed, researchers quickly traced the bounty to its next destination.
"We figured out that the authors of WannaCry 2’s ransomware moved bitcoins they got from the last attack to another cryptocurrency called Monero," said Alberto Ornaghi, a cybersecurity researcher at Milan-based Neutrino, a company specializing in bitcoin intelligence.
The conversion pattern scheme -- using a range of 1-1.5 bitcoins for each conversion transaction -- is the same used with WannaCry 1 ransomware and the cryptocurrency conversion service used is called ShapeShift.io, Ornaghi added in a phone interview. 
"Knowing the destination of these bitcoins and the conversion service the WannaCry authors used could allow law enforcement to figure out their real identities,” Ornaghi said. “The conversion is still continuing and we are closely monitoring it.”

=== Title: Bitcoin's Push to $8,000 Fades as Free-Money Trades Unwind - Bloomberg ===

Turns out not everyone is happy with the detente in bitcoin’s civil war.
While the cryptocurrency soared to a record $7,882 within minutes of news that it would 
 another split on Wednesday, the gains quickly evaporated. Bitcoin is now trading about 3 percent below where it was before a faction of the community scrapped plans for a so-called hard fork.
Some speculators are disappointed they won’t get the additional coins that would have been created by a hard fork. While bitcoin splits are potentially disruptive, they’ve so far amounted to free money for holders of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash, the result of a hard fork in August, now trades for around $600 and Bitcoin Gold, created in October, fetches about $140.   
Bitcoin’s reversal was “likely due to disappointment among some that they wouldn’t get their free coins,” said Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin Ltd. “But overall we see the price recovering, given that bitcoin’s future is more certain now.”

=== Title: Around the World in 30 Steaks: The Best From Las Vegas to Tokyo - Bloomberg ===

Restaurant food doesn't get much simpler than a properly cooked chunk of beef—and rarely delivers so much pleasure.
The smoky sweetness of the char, with its hint of crispness. The soft flesh releasing the deep and earthy flavors of the meat. It's the stuff of  meaty dreams and enjoyed worldwide.
Yet it's easy to ruin a steak. No amount of sauce or mustard can fix bad beef. Overcooked meat will be dry and chewy. Walk into a random steakhouse when traveling and you may suffer more disappointment than joy.
Help is at hand. We asked leading chefs and restaurateurs for their picks around the world, from the classics of New York through the quality meats of South America through to the upstart steakhouses of London and Tokyo.
"I love the steak with garlic and soy," says chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, whose restaurants include Jean-Georges and Prime steakhouses in Las Vegas. "It's wagyu beef wood-grilled, brushed with garlic and soy, cooked rare, sliced and served with white rice on the side."
This chophouse (and former speakeasy) in the West Village is the pick of chef Chris Cosentino of Cockscomb in San Francisco. "The best steak I ever had, hands down, is at the Beatrice Inn. It was a 137-day whisky-aged huge tomahawk. (Chef) Angie Mar learned the technique in France and brought it to the U.S. That steak blew my head off. It was insane."
"It's my favorite steakhouse," says chef Daniel Boulud, whose New York restaurants include Daniel. "It's the oldest in New York city, since 1885, and the most authentic and classic. Plus they have the most amazing collection of Scotch."
"There's so much history there," says Will Guidara, co-owner of Eleven Madison Park and NoMad, in New York. "It feels as New York as any restaurant in the city. Go for the mutton chop and stay for the prime rib hash."
Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti is a fan. "I always love Keens: Mutton chop and a few steaks," he says.
Butcher-and-chef Richard H. Turner of Hawksmoor in London agrees: "I am not a fan of USDA (American beef) but I like Keens."
Keith McNally's Greenwich Village brasserie is a winner for Garutti. "My favorite place for steak in New York City isn't necessarily a steakhouse," he says. "It's Minetta Tavern." He goes for the dry-aged cote de boeuf with bone marrow and recommends a burger as mid-course.
"I would put Minetta Tavern up there for sure," says chef John Cadieux of Goodman steakhouse in London, "Great steak and great atmosphere."
"The idea of a steakhouse has been dandified by chefs who have complicated things," Nobu co-owner Drew Nieporent says. "Customers like a steakhouse that is very straightforward. The Palm has always been my favorite. It's very consistent, with excellent hospitality."
"My favorite steakhouse is a New York favorite: Peter Luger," Vongerichten says. "The T-bone steak is aged perfectly in house, cooked rare, sliced then butter on top, under the broiler and finished medium-rare. Succulent and fantastic beef flavor."
Food writer Tom Parker Bowles keeps going back:  "I love it just for those huge slabs of old school corn-fed beef. Plus crisp bacon as a snack and slightly grumpy waiters. "
Chef Albert Roux of Le Gavroche in London says:  "The whole atmosphere was wonderful and the cuts of meat superb."
"Sparks is a nostalgic and traditional favorite," says Danny Meyer of Union Square Hospitality Group. "Amazing wine list. Standard order: crab and shrimp cocktail, prime sirloin steak, hashed browns, spinach, Basset's double chocolate chip ice cream for dessert! I go there every time we close a deal with a landlord for a new restaurant, since I was taken there in 1985 when I bought the lease for the space that would become Union Square Cafe."
Dry-aged steaks are cooked over a mesquite grill at Alfred's, which traces its history to 1928 and is now owned by chef Daniel Patterson. "Daniel is bringing in great varieties of different styles of beef and different ages. with steamed spinach, baked potatoes—just really beautiful classic stuff," says Cockscomb's Cosentino. "That's what makes Alfred's so cool."
Chef Cosentino serves up a meaty menu that features pin-bone steak with a marrow dip. "It's a good town and he's the man you want," says St. John's Trevor Gulliver. "He knows that provenance and good butchery are a must and he's as happy as the proverbial when cooking."
This fine-dining restaurant with views over Seattle is another of Garutti's picks. "It's not a steakhouse but it's the best restaurant overall and steak in Seattle," he says.
Wolfgang Puck's steakhouse at the Venetian has great meat, chef Roux says. "I didn't go for the wagyu—I'm a purist when it comes to beef," he says. "I went for grain-fed USDA, typical American. People knock it but I thought it was bloody good. The steak of choice for me would be a big slice of rump char-grilled."
"This is a random one for you if you're ever in Ithaca, New York, where I went to school," Garutti says. This restaurant near Cornell is known for its dry-aged steaks. The specialty is a 40 ounce Porterhouse for two, at $98.
This privately owned chain first opened in 1976, founded by a family of immigrants from Greece. The steaks are dry-aged in house.  "Excellent meat and an extraordinary wine list," says chef Joan Roca, co-owner of El Celler de Can Roca, in Spain, which has twice won the title of World's Best Restaurant. 
Vongerichten's Prime restaurant in the Bellagio Hotel is known for its classic dining room and its great meat. "Jean-Georges has elevated every side dish and salads, too," Nieporent says. "It's the quintessential Las Vegas restaurant."
This restaurant in Browns Hotel traces its history to 2004 and bills itself as the first modern steakhouse in the U.S. "It's an endless great scene, with massive portions and a solid steak," Garutti says.
Parker Bowles says it used to be one of the only decent restaurants in South Beach. There are "many more now, but it still holds nostalgic appeal," he says.
Wolfgang Puck's restaurant in Maui is the pick of chef Shane Osborn of Arcane, in Hong Kong. "The best steak I've had in recent years was there," he says. "The bone-in ribeye was delicious."
This is a secret restaurant, without a website or even a sign to identify it. You have to be known to the chef to get a table. Wolfgang Puck is a fan. "My chef at Spago, Tetsu Yahagi, told me about the restaurant," Puck says. "What I love about it is that it is not a traditional steakhouse. Chef Kaz Oyama serves an eight-to-10-course menu of beef prepared in various ways, including 
 style where you grill the meat yourself at your table. It’s also BYOB and is the perfect place to bring your favorite bottle of red wine; just be sure to save a glass for the chef."
Hawksmoor first opened in London in 2006 and is now preparing to open in New York. "I'm a Hawksmoor man," says Shake Shack's Garutti. "Porterhouse with beef-dripping fries and a Caesar salad."
Chef Michel Roux Jr of Le Gavroche in London is also a fan. "I had an amazing steak," he says. "I was very, very impressed. It's the quality of all the different cuts, from high-end fillet, which I am not a big fan of, to the tomahawk for two or three people. "
Trevor Gulliver, co-owner of St. John restaurant in London, credits chef  Turner for Hawksmoor's quality: "If he's at the heat I'm there. He knows his animals as a butcher and the flames as a chef."
This unfussy steakhouse is one of the best in Latin America. "Don Julio is by far my favorite steakhouse," says Peruvian chef Gaston Acurio, of Astrid & Gaston in Lima. "They use grass-fed beef from the pampas of Argentina, for sustainable quality and flavor."
"It's a traditional family restaurant with extraordinary meats, especially 
 (skirt) cuts, says chef Roca.
This bistro is among the best-known in Paris, with a reputation for simple cooking, without fuss. "The steak frites are definitive," says Nobu's Nieporent.
"This is a great place," chef Puck says. "The chef has an incredible selection of Italian beef - my favorite is the Chianina - and a fantastic wine selection from Tuscany.”
This Nihonbashi restaurant is hard to find. Cronut king Dominique Ansel discovered it on a visit to his bakery in Tokyo. "The best bite I had in Tokyo was a steak sandwich from Shima," he says. "The chef perfectly sears the most beautifully marbled wagyu from Kyoto, and if you have any left over, he makes a sandwich for you to take home."
This butcher's shop and restaurant is a favorite of chef Roca. Owner "Renzo Garibaldi has converted his restaurant into a cult location for meat," he says.
"The restaurant came out on top in a film about the best steaks in the world," says Hawksmoor's Turner. "They do steak tasting menus that are stunning. (Owner) Jose Gordon rears his own cattle and hangs his own meat. He's a butcher, farmer and chef. Everything is done on site. It's very, very good."
Tucked away in a mountain village in the Basque region, Casa Julian is owned by a father-and-son team and is well worth the trip, says chef Elena Arzak of Arzak in San Sebastian. "There is only one main course option: 
(chops), fire-grilled rare," she says. "Big handfuls of sea salt are spread across the meat as it crackles and crisps above the flames. It's turned once, sprinkled again with salt, and then served still sizzling."
"The meat is crispy, dark, and umami-rich on the outside, while the middle retains the fresh and flavorful bite of pure grass-fed beef," in this restaurant close to the French border, Arzak says. "Next to the reception is the star of the show: a great glass case with enormous loins of beef under spotlights. There are cuts from cows and oxen, some young and bright, while others have the dark wisdom that can only be obtained by slow and steady dry-aging."
This steak restaurant specializes in older cattle from Iberian breeds. "The chef, Carles Tejedor, manages this new restaurant," says chef Roca. "It has a very good location, and a casual and elegant atmosphere."
This Basque restaurant sits in countryside near the coast, close by the French border. "They raise their own cows from 100 percent wagyu stock," Arzak says. "Perfectly marbled steaks—buttery in flavor and in texture—are expertly grilled in this multi-generational farmhouse restaurant."
This modern Australian barbecue restaurant is the pick of Australian chef Osborn. "Anything (chef-owner) Dave Pynt cooks in his bespoke built barbecue is awesome, especially the Mayura wagyu from Oz."
This restaurant is housed in the Mercado del Puerto. The old port market building is filled with restaurants and the smell of roasting beef. El Palenque has been open for more than 50 years and has a good wine cellar. "There's an endless array of grilled meats perfectly cooked over low embers," Nobu's Nieporent says.

=== Title: Junk on Broadway Review - Bloomberg ===

“This is the story of how kings are made,” a jaded journalist proclaims at the start of 
, 
. “Or what passes for kings these days.”
Financiers who lived through the dizzy 1980s will remember the era of Wall Street royalty, when a new guard of dealmakers began to see debt differently, as a thing of value. As investors chased yield, they embraced risk with zeal—and the most voracious among them were rewarded with mountains of cash. In Akhtar’s cautionary study of the period, in previews at New York’s Lincoln Center Theater, an older financier can’t get his head around the core of what came to be called “creative financing.” “Debt is not an asset,” he declares. “Debt is debt!”
We meet Akhtar’s protagonist, Robert “Bob” Merkin (Steven Pasquale), after his coronation. The cover of 
 magazine labels him “America’s alchemist,” a man who forges multimillion-dollar deals out of debt and equity. He’s driven by avarice but also titillated by risk, insulated by a sense of invincibility. Merkin sees himself as a modern-day J.P. Morgan. “We’re going to change history,” he confides to a colleague. “We’re going to change the world.”
We have certainly learned the lessons that came with these changes, more than once now. But the subject matter seems especially relevant today, as we reckon with the consequences of this kind of dealmaking. Akhtar himself was a student of the junk bond boom. When he moved to New York in 1995, his dad offered to pay his rent if he agreed to read the 
 every day. “I started to observe how all this stuff was transforming our lives,” Akhtar says after a recent performance. “Or at least I believed it was.”
In 
, Merkin’s unsuspecting takeover target is Everson Steel in Allegheny, Pa., thousands of miles and a world away from West Los Angeles, where Merkin is based. Here, the conflict crystallizes. Thomas Everson Jr. (Rick Holmes), presiding over a small empire of mills and smelters, feels responsible for his thousands of employees. When an outside investor amasses a sizable position in Everson Steel, he sees barbarians at the gate. The company has been struggling, but Everson hasn’t been looking for a lifeline.
Performing sorcery depends on secrecy and subterfuge. The artist knows that if a viewer fully understands what happens behind the scenes, magic becomes, well, less magical. Financial wizardry has some of the same mystique, which makes the playwright’s job difficult: How do you make a complex financial transaction comprehensible—and, better still, compelling—to theatergoers?
“It is incumbent on me, as a writer, to provide enough information for the audience, through action and context and dialogue, to understand at least what the basic concept is,” Akhtar says. The play isn’t overly didactic, though. You don’t have to understand all the jargon to grasp the implications of what happens. That said, viewers familiar with the ways of Wall Street will be grateful to Akhtar for doing his due diligence. Two of his closest friends are in finance, and one of them edited an early draft.
“Finding a way to write about business, where the human stakes do have consequence, is really the challenge,” Akhtar says. “Getting a deal done is about getting a deal done, but it is not always about whether someone is going to live or die.”
It helps that so much in the show—and the plight of Everson and his employees—feels familiar and real. The financiers, investors, reporters, and lawyers in 
 are Akhtar’s own creations, but he acknowledges that Bob Merkin’s resemblance to Michael Milken extends beyond their near-rhymed surnames. And Akhtar suspects there will be ticket holders who are acquaintances of some of the men who inspired his characters. But, he cautions, “there isn’t a consistent line to be drawn” between Merkin and Milken. His advice? See Merkin as a metaphor.
 focuses on a pivotal moment in American history, when the country’s value system started to shift, along with the definition of “success.” Three decades later, it’s worth reflecting on what changed and what’s happened. At one point, Merkin and his colleagues raise the specter of “Dow 20,000.” I heard laughter in the audience as the characters debated its inevitability. The Dow Jones industrial average crossed that threshold earlier this year, and in October, the index set a new high.

=== Title: Coal Is Fueling Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin has a dirty secret.
The cryptocurrency has wowed markets this year with breakneck gains as investors flocked to an asset that exists only in cyberspace. But the laborious creation of each digital bitcoin by private computer networks has real-world consequences in the form of massive energy use -- including from fuels that cause the most pollution.
Eight 100-meter-long metal warehouses in northern China are a case in point. Bitmain Technologies Ltd. runs a server farm in Erdors, Inner Mongolia, with about 25,000 computers dedicated to solving the encrypted calculations that generate each bitcoin. The entire operation runs on electricity produced with coal, as do a growing number of cryptocurrency “mines” popping up in China.
The global industry’s power use already may equal 
 U.S. homes, topping the individual consumption of 
, according to the Digiconomist Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. As more bitcoin is created, the difficulty rate of token-generating calculations increases, as does the need for electricity.
“This has become a dirty thing to produce,” said Christopher Chapman, a London-based analyst at Citigroup Inc.
Energy has always been part of 
’s DNA. The person credited with creating the currency, identified only as Satoshi Nakamoto, devised the system that awards virtual coins for solving complex puzzles and uses an encrypted digital ledger to track all the work and every transaction. As the market grew from a hobbyist culture in 2009 to a global phenomenon this year, ever-more computing power was needed by large networks.
Bitcoin prices have surged more than 2,000 percent in the past year on some exchanges and touched a record of more than $17,900 on Friday. Cboe Global Markets Inc. began offering bitcoin futures on Dec. 11, reaching $18,850 on the first day of trading. There are other 
, such as ethereum and litecoin, but bitcoin is by far the largest.
China, which gets about 60 percent of its electricity from coal, is the biggest operator of computer “mines” and probably accounts for about a quarter of all the power used to create cryptocurrencies, according to a study of the industry published in April by Garrick Hileman and Michel Rauchs at Cambridge University.
About 58 percent of the world’s large cryptocurrency mining pools were located in China, followed by the U.S. at 16 percent, the researchers said. China is the biggest producer and consumer of coal, and server farms in provinces such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Heilongjian are heavily reliant upon the fuel.
Estimates of how much electricity goes into making cryptocurrencies vary widely -- from the output of one large nuclear reactor to the consumption of the entire population of Denmark. But analysts agree that the industry’s power use is expanding rapidly -- especially after a price rally that made bitcoin almost four times more valuable than just three months ago.
Total electricity use in bitcoin mining has increased by 30 percent in the past month, according to Alex de Vries, a 28-year-old blockchain analyst for accounting firm PwC.
“The energy-consumption is insane,” said de Vries, who started the Digiconomist blog to show the potential pitfalls in cryptocurrency. “If we start using this on a global scale, it will kill the planet.”
Some analysts 
 such claims as alarmist, noting that even the high-end estimates of demand account for only about 0.1 percent of what the world uses. Advances in technology also may make operations more energy efficient.
Still, it’s getting more expensive to produce cryptocurrency as the energy use of the process rises. Miners -- especially the big ones -- will look for the cheapest power to better weather price volatility, according to the Cambridge study. Electricity costs in China, which has surplus capacity of coal-fired generators and vast reserves of the fuel, is well below what consumers pay in the U.S. or Europe.
Bitcoin’s algorithm dictates that after a certain number of tokens are created, more work is required for the next batch, said James Butterfill, the head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities Ltd. in London who has been studying cryptocurrency markets.
Using estimates of electricity prices and the rising speed with which calculations must occur, Butterfill estimates the marginal costs of each bitcoin will more than double from $6,611 in the fourth quarter to $14,175 in the second quarter of 2018. At the start of 2017, the cost was $2,856. With costs rising, there’s a greater risk for miners should prices tumble.
“You’d be hard-pressed to find anywhere where it isn’t profitable to mine,” said Butterfill,  who set up computers at his home in England to mine tokens in his spare time and joined a network of 120,000 others to boost processing capacity and returns. “But if you’re investing in a bitcoin rig, you have to look at the long term, and with the volatility as high as it is, it probably still doesn’t make sense to mine bitcoin in Europe.”
Not all cryptocurrency mining is dirty. Computers in Iceland get power from geothermal plants. Even in China, some are clustered around hydroelectric facilities in Sichuan and Yunnan.
In Austria, Hydrominer IT-Services GmbH put servers inside hydro-power plants. It was the cheapest option, said Michael Marcovici, a company founder, who began mining in 2013.
“Frankly, we didn’t start this as an environmental project,” Marcovici said. “It is bad for bitcoin to have this news all the time about this dirty energy. People don’t want dirty energy to be used. But the problem is, in Europe, the energy is just too expensive.”

=== Title: The Audi S3 Is the Sports Sedan You Didn't Know You Were Waiting For - Bloomberg ===

The 2017 Audi S3 is a difficult car to nail. 
In the edit meeting where I pitched this review of this powerful, peppy sports sedan, a colleague asked, “Oh, so is the S3 like a BMW 3-Series?”
Not really. The $42,900 Audi is smaller and sportier than that.
OK, so what about the BMW M2? That’s closer, but the M2 has two doors (as the less powerful 2-Series), and this one has four.
Maybe the Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG?
The CLA45 AMG is a lot faster and more powerful than S3, and it looks droopier across the body. But that might be the closest we get. At least they’re nearly the same price.
In fact, the $42,900 S3 sits in the rare position of having no direct competitors, which in turn allows it to compete against all comers who dare to challenge its frame. This is the sport sedan that you use every day if you’re going to be doing some heavy driving but want to have fun behind the wheel, not just drive mindlessly. Audi says it’s for the “sophisticated” driver who wants to “live life in the fast lane—or leave the crowd behind.”
Driving it is like a good first date: The car is good-looking, smart but not too nerdy, and fun. Plus, you’ve heard good things about him (or her) in the press and think he’s cool. Audi sold 31,538 units in the A3/S3 model line in 2016.
If you’ve been looking for a unique sport sedan lately, something unexpected, this could be it. Get it in a bright color.
Let’s talk about how it looks. Cosmetic changes to this year’s S3 over previous generations are just what you’d want for a film star—subtle enough to make the face look rested but not revised. There are some new creases and cornering around the angular LED headlights and the signature large Audi grille; the intakes have been lowered as well. Along the sides, the S3 is tucked up higher than the A4 sedan, with a blunter rear end squared off as though it has done those butt-lifts that make it hurt to sit the next day. Perky. (This is a relative term, yes, when it comes to sedans, which are pretty sedate and generic compared with sports cars and convertibles. But you take what you can get.)
Elsewhere, exterior details also delight: When you engage the hazards or use the turn indicators, each tail light illuminates in a pleasing moving line, progressing away from the center of the car, with each tiny bulb lighting independently in a gentle wave effect of red brake lights. Red S3 badging, 19-inch wheels (part of a $1,500 drivers package), and red caliper brakes ($400) help denote that the S3 is more special than other sedans and, more importantly, that you are special for driving it.
The S3 I drove cost $51,725 after such upgrades as the Daytona Gray paint job ($575) and the technology package ($3,000). (Remember, the base version costs $42,900). That beats both the $46,450 M240i and the $49,950 CLA45 AMG, both of which will cost even more, too, of course, if you choose to buy extras.
As far as numbers go, this is where the good news ends.
S3 falters with fuel economy. BMW’s M240i achieves 21 mpg in the city and 31 mgp on the highway. Mercedes’s CLA45 AMG can hit 23 mgp in the city and 30 mpg on the highway. S3, meanwhile, achieves 21 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway. That’s fewer miles per gallon than competitors can manage and a 
 from the previous generation S3, which posted EPA ratings of 23 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway. 
Similarly, while the S3 has an excellent 2.0 liter, 292hp I4 engine, it lags behind the power of the 335 inline-six BMW M2 and 375hp of the inline-four Mercedes CLA45 AMG. Zero to 60 mph speeds are 4.7 seconds, 4.2 seconds, and 4.1 seconds, respectively. You’re also going to want a little more feedback from the steering wheel when you get inside—one turn of a bolt tighter would mean a lot.
Don’t get me wrong. This is a great car; it’s quite fun. The six-speed transmission works as smoothly as any in the category; the Quattro all-wheel drive never falters. The whole thing grips corners and across traffic lanes. S3 shares an engine and AWD system with the Volkswagen Golf R, so the spunky DNA of that fun rally car leaves fingerprints here. Get the (optional) magnetic ride, which’ll iron it out like silk to proper luxury levels.
The cabin inside sits between the stark minimalism of the BMW and the almost too-much tech of the CLA45 AMG—lots of things like climate zones, heated seats, a parking system and rearview camera, and a panoramic sunroof come standard. The rear seat is viable for adult-sized legs, and the spacious trunk suits as road trip-friendly companion. As long as you’re not planning to drive to China or anything. The three-spoke, flat bottom steering wheel, S Sport seats and virtual cockpit all make it feel modern, cool, and, yes, special.

=== Title: Bitcoin Is Likely to Split Again in November, Say Major Players - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin is looking increasingly likely to splinter off again in November, creating a third version of the world’s largest cryptocurrency as miners and developers pursue separate visions to scale its rapidly growing marketplace.
Major industry players, including the bitcoin investor Roger Ver known as “Bitcoin Jesus” for proselytizing on behalf of the digital currency, say consensus between opposing camps looked increasingly unlikely. That opinion was echoed by some of the biggest mining pool operators and also programmers -- known as “Core” developers -- who were instrumental to developing the infrastructure of the original bitcoin network.
In recent weeks, a group of miners -- people who crunch complex math problems to generate and transact the digital currency -- split off from the legacy bitcoin to use a new version known as 
. Ver is moving some of his funds into the new offshoot as he anticipates what would be the second split of the currency of 2017. Ver admits he could potentially benefit from such a schism as more coins are created.
“There’s probably going to be another split between bitcoin legacy and SegWit2X version of bitcoin but that just gives me more coins that I can sell for the Bitcoin Cash version,” Ver said in an 
 on Bloomberg Television at a conference organized by Bitkan in Hong Kong.
Bitcoin’s popularity has led to congestion in trade, with transaction times and processing fees at one point soaring to records. Debate over how to deal with the problem has divided the trading community, with some proposing boosting the number of transactions in each block that has to be verified by miners, and others advocating for moving some information off the main network.
One faction of the community is pushing for a network upgrade in November, which could lead to a split if no consensus is made.
When the split occurred around the beginning of August -- with Bitcoin Cash diverging from legacy bitcoin -- the digital currency initially slumped 6.8 percent in a two-day slide as investors appeared to discount the value of the new coin. But prices subsequently rallied, surging to a record $4,880.85 by Sept. 1 before China announced a crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings that sent prices 
 20 percent. 
While an early adopter of bitcoin, Ver has also attracted controversy for his embrace of Bitcoin Cash, which some developers criticize for giving too much power to miners.
If another tear occurs in November, it would create a third version of the cryptocurrency and potentially further scatter capital and resources as three offshoots of bitcoin emerge.
SegWit2x refers to a compromise proposal developed to deal with the surge in transactions. In August, miners agreed to implement the first phase of the proposal, or SegWit. They were expected to increase the blocksize to two megabytes around November in a second phase.
Avoiding such a splinter requires miners to reach at least 92-percent consensus on supporting the second phase of SegWit2x, but that’s becoming increasingly unlikely, according to Wang Chun, co-owner and chief administrator of F2Pool, one of the world’s largest mining pools.
Even though SegWit2x garnered more than 93 percent support in July, miners and developers seem to be backing away from the proposal, a compromise that harbors characteristics disliked by extremists on both sides. Wang said he thinks the split will “happen, 100 percent.”
Many Core developers agree. Several have said they’d prefer to focus on writing code in the future for only the SegWit chain: currently the largest version of bitcoin at about $64 billion in market value.
“Many developers, users, miners, and businesses have already stated they do not agree with the pointless 2x fork, so we’ll likely end up with three chains,” said Samson Mow, chief strategy officer at Blockstream, which has close associations with Core developers. “Long-term, only the main bitcoin chain which has the support of users and developers can survive.”
Then there’s Bitcoin Cash, which was split off so miners could boost the block size of transactions. It’s more useful as it can be moved more quickly and cheaply than other cryptocurrencies, Ver argued. Some bitcoin exchanges and wallets have said they will support the new coin, while others are uncertain whether Bitcoin Cash will have lasting market value.
Already, key players are warning investors to brace for more turmoil. Core developers including Peter Todd say the fork this time could be much more tumultuous, and could incur more user confusion of what version can be dubbed the actual “bitcoin.”
“In a sense, a split is 100-percent guaranteed,” said Todd, a key coding contributor to bitcoin. “The split is likely to be more disruptive.”

=== Title: The Best Luxury Car Instagram Feeds to Follow for Auto Fanatics - Bloomberg ===

Cars, like other visually intriguing and tactile subjects such as food, fashion, and the human body, lend themselves particularly well to Instagram.
The luxury brands quickly realized this and have built vast followings by sharing thrilling photos of their wares. 
, for example, racked up more than 6 million followers by posting images of its cars in context—driving on ice, on racetracks, and near beaches.

 almost 7 million, and 
 more than 10 million.
But the liveliest conversation online comes 
, 
,

 who began their feeds 
 (and can make a bit of cash from them—or 
 
). Their 
 is varied—some focus on Italian supercars; others on automotive architecture and its sometimes 
; still others focus on “rare, strange and perfect” cars in 
. Some photograph with expensive Cannon, Nikon and Leica cameras; others prefer the iPhone 7.
What they all have in common is a focused sense of purpose and an excellent eye for composition.
“For me it is, How can I showcase timeless beauty, cars that age really well, and then how can I punctuate that with new cars that carry on that philosophy?” said Ted Gushue, the editorial director of 
 who has nearly 47,000. (Petrolicious itself boasts more than 263,000—and regularly features favorite Instagrammers 
.) “The medium is so genuine that it rewards a really honest image presentation. Not necessarily filtered photos. I am honest about what my work is and want you to come along for the ride. People respond to that.”
Gushue speaks to a highly educated audience of car lovers who engage with him on every facet of the car: They’ll talk about the year and specs of the car, then compare it with similar and competing models of that time. Their opinions are not facts, but they are debated as though they were. (His own interest leans heavily toward vintage.)
Ian Wood, who runs the Instagram feed 
, has an equally inspiring eye, if fewer followers (for now). Wood speaks to those who love a California vibe—his audience tracks him to see what is happening at local car shows, swap meets and secret gatherings up and down the coast. They trust his eye will pick the most important cars of the group to photograph.
“It just started it as a hobby, but then I realized I do have something unique, I do actually have something to say,” he said. “And anyway, what else am I going to do? I didn’t want to sit around doing nothing.”
He’s not the only one. Here are a dozen of the best individual photographers focusing on cars (and motorcycles here and there, too) working on Instagram today.

I’ll have true Chicano low rider guys commenting on posts but by the same token I will post a Ferrari and have those guys commenting. I like how the cars can unite people.” 
Wood, who studied car design in the U.K. before moving to L.A years ago, attended more than 100 car shows last year in pursuit of his obsession. He attends everything from low-rider swap meets to Ferrari rallies. At his peak he attended eight separate car events in one weekend.  
“It’s about the lighting, it’s about the positioning of the car—the way it’s parked or the background,” he said. “At first it was difficult to know what to capture, but then when you get into the rhythm of it you start to understand, ‘I see that everywhere; I don’t need to post it.’”

=== Title: Detroit Bets You’ll Get Sick of SUVs - Bloomberg ===

The auto show in Detroit this week is stuffed with cars. Not 6,000-pound SUVs or spacecraft-hauling pickup trucks, but regular old sedans and coupes—spinning on the industry’s greatest stage like so many boring vanilla cakes.
Of the 20 or so new models unveiled at the North American International Auto Show, about half were low to the ground. Granted, these pedestrian cruisers are laced with carbon fiber and the stirrings of self-driving technology, but in form and function, this is innovation circa 1980. There’s even a Swedish 
 in the mix.
Kia rolled out a four-door grand-touring sedan called the 
; Mercedes showed a coupe version of its E-Class; and Toyota pulled the cover off a thoroughly updated Camry. Porsche, ever speedy, beat everyone—in October, it shipped over its overhauled Panamera, a four-door sedan, to show off 
 in New York.
Given recent sales trends, this crush of short cars seems like a strategic disaster. After all, cheap gas has fueled the SUV fever running rampant across America and now even spreading around the world. Utilities, trucks, and so-called crossovers made up two-thirds of all vehicles bought in the U.S. last year. “There is a clear trend towards trucks and we don’t see any reason why it should stop,” said Ludwig Willisch, chief executive of BMW North America.
The momentum for SUV mania is built on strong engineering. Utility vehicles used to be a trade-off: In exchange for a higher riding position and a bit more safety, consumers sacrificed driving dynamics and mileage. But SUVs today are built largely like cars, with lightweight metals and efficient engines allowing them to perform almost as well as lower-slung siblings, both on the road and at the fuel pump. Last year, in the U.S. luxury market alone, car sales skidded by 172,000 vehicles, while consumers bought 99,000 more swanky SUVs. 
“The reality is we have a lineup of four very fine automobiles, but in a market that almost seems to be in a state of free fall,” Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen said.
So what futuristic machine did Cadillac bring to lure the masses to its stand? Not an SUV, but a relatively big, swanky sedan. BMW did the same.
Car executives aren’t dense, despite what Dieselgate and the Pontiac Aztek may suggest. But when it comes to SUVs, they know something most people in a dealership don’t: Drivers in large part buy the machines that car companies want them to buy. 
Lately, most of the newest models have been SUVs. New models make the most money, eat up advertising budgets, and get prime position on showroom floors. In short, the SUV boom is to some extent self-propagating. “There’s definitely a bit of a chicken-and-egg thing there,” said Drew Slaven, vice president of marketing at Mercedes-Benz USA.
But down in the trenches, things are beginning to change. Mercedes dealers have recently asked the company to “take the foot off the pedal” with SUV marketing, Slaven said. At the Mercedes stand in Detroit this week, less than one-third of the vehicles were crossovers or utilities.
Most executives don’t expect the traditional car to make a roaring comeback, at least not right away. Cadillac is rushing to build a small SUV, for example, while BMW designers are crunching on a massive one. What they do expect is for the decline in sedan and coupe sales to slow, largely because any spike in gas prices, for one, may give them a jolt just as it did in the mid-2000s.
More broadly (and regardless of geopolitics), drivers who want to stand out will eventually drift from the SUV lane. Just like those who bought Jeeps in the 1980s and Ford Explorers in the 1990s, tastes sometimes just change.
“There is always a counter-swing,” said Scott Keogh, president of Audi of America, whose marketing muscle last year helped make its new, midsize A4 an exception to the SUV rule with a 15.3 percent sales bump. “There will be a generation that comes that says, ‘The SUV was my dad’s car and the SUV was that snooty banker’s car.’ ”
Volvo, for example, rolled out an 
 last year. And while no 
 to the SUV market, the automaker’s Detroit offering this year is a station wagon, 
. 
“I’ve been stating for 10 years now that sport wagons will come back in the U.S.,” said Volvo’s North America CEO Lex Kerssemakers. “If you’ve been raised in SUVs, by definition you’ll want to do something different from your parents.”
There’s also a bit of game theory involved. Car companies committed to sedans and coupes are expecting the field to thin, making room for some new blood. In Detroit alone, executives recently announced plans to idle the Chevrolet SS, the Chrysler 200, and the Dodge Dart. Sure, the auto business will eventually cede to Uber-driving robots and ride-sharing Google pods, but there’s a lot of money to be made in the meantime.
De Nysschen, at Cadillac, said consumer tastes will always ebb and flow. “It was sedans and then it was wagons and then it became vans and then crossovers,” he explained. “Now you’re getting crossovers that are getting lower.” He added: “If we carry on long enough, we’re back to hatchbacks.”

=== Title: Bitcoin Exchanges Struggle to Win Investor Confidence - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin needs “Downtown” Josh Brown more than he needs bitcoin. Brown, the chief executive officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management and author of a popular finance blog, has long been skeptical of the digital currency. He finally 
, he said, “because the goddamn thing won’t go away.”
Still, Brown, who helps manage half a billion dollars, isn’t really a convert quite yet, especially when it comes to security measures at bitcoin exchanges. He researched several before buying his bitcoins at Coinbase Inc. and wasn’t impressed, he said in an interview. “I don’t think any one service is safer than another. It’s too early to anoint any of them as the JPMorgan of bitcoin. I don’t think that exists.”
Such concerns are the biggest obstacle to growth in the market for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether, the second-biggest. Even as investors are lured by their price gains and volatility, the biggest institutions are reluctant to get in, raising further concerns about liquidity. The challenge for exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini Trust Co. is persuading major financial players that the 
 for digital assets meets 21st Century standards.
The dangers are apparent. On June 21, ether crashed to 10 cents from $317.81 in trading on Coinbase. The cause was a single $12.5 million trade -- one of the biggest ever -- that triggered further selling. It all happened in just 45 milliseconds, after which computer algorithms started buying, driving prices back up to $300 within 10 seconds. Some digital coin exchanges have collapsed or customer funds have 
. All of which is scaring away the very investors the exchanges need to succeed. 
Cumberland Mining, a unit of Chicago-based high-frequency trading firm DRW Holdings LLC, handles many big orders privately “because the exchanges and other marketplaces can’t handle that type of liquidity or don’t have that type of liquidity,” said Bobby Cho, a cryptocurrency trader at Cumberland. “The marketplace is so fragmented that liquidity is fragmented.”
At the heart of bitcoin trading stands the blockchain, a so-called distributed ledger that is also touted, loudly and often, as a cure-all for markets that would speed up clearing, eliminate costly delays over disputed trades and reduce capital costs for banks. The hype, however, sometimes outstrips the reality.
When Brown bought his bitcoin, he was unaware that the purchase wasn’t secured on the blockchain, that it was only held internally at Coinbase. That puts extra pressure on markets to maintain security to thwart hackers and thieves. After Brown wrote about buying bitcoin on his blog, “People were screaming at me, ‘Coinbase is not for storage!’” he said. In response, a friend helped him set up a wallet to hold his bitcoin that is secured by the blockchain.
“It’s the Wild West, it’s very much early days still,” said Richard Johnson, a market-structure analyst at Greenwich Associates who specializes in blockchain. Johnson agreed that the time and complexity of moving digital currencies from one exchange to another is “not acceptable” given how modern investors operate, and that while Gemini, Coinbase’s GDAX and other U.S.-based exchanges have strong know-your-customer procedures, more needs to be done. “If people want to get serious about this for real banking transactions, it needs to be better and easier to use.”
Investment money continues to pour into digital assets. 
 that it received a $100 million investment from a group led by IVP. It plans to use the money to expand its engineering and customer support staff, open a New York office for its professional trading platform GDAX and grow Toshi, “a mobile browser for the ethereum network that provides universal access to financial services,” said Megan Hernbroth, a spokeswoman.
Adam White, general manager for GDAX, said the company only allows fully collateralized trading and should be thought of as a spot market. That means if a Coinbase user doesn’t have the cash to cover the whole trade, it doesn’t happen.
“What we’ve been very good at is preventing people from fraudulently buying digital currency,” he said in an interview. “We’re doing hundreds of trades per minute, and we immediately settle and clear all those trades on our platform,” he said. “There’s no need to post those to the blockchain.” Coinbase is regulated by New York State under its BitLicense program, which among other things requires registration by any company “performing exchange services as a customer business,” according to the state 
.
Coinbase has also acquired about 35 money transmitter licenses from U.S. states that require them, White said. The exchange acts as a custodian to many of its users and stores several billion dollars worth of digital assets, according to White. Keeping those funds safe is Coinbase’s No. 1 priority, White said. Still, he acknowledged the spotty history of digital asset exchanges.
“This is an industry that has a less-than-stellar past when it comes to meeting customer requirements,” he said. The general movement is in the right direction, however, he said.
DV Chain, a sister company to DV Trading in Chicago, handles most of its cryptocurrency trading volume off-exchange, said CEO Garrett See. While DV does transact on a number of platforms, lack of liquidity and the quality of the technology can be a problem on exchanges, he said.
“Some of these exchanges take seconds or sometimes minutes between when you click to buy and when your order makes it to the exchange, if it makes it at all,” See said. Because there are so many exchanges, “liquidity is distributed across lots of different places,” he added. If the market got to a point where there was a centralized exchange and all the volume is there, “then I don’t think you’re going to see flash crashes like that as much,” See said.
See and Cumberland’s Cho are exactly the type of market makers that digital exchanges need, yet the adage of “liquidity builds liquidity” is a tough problem to solve. “Market makers play that role, of bringing agility and efficiency to the marketplace,” said Javier Paz, a senior analyst at Aite Group LLC. “The role of a liquidity maker requires at the very least close rapport with cryptocurrency exchanges,” Paz said.
There are signs that the worlds of cryptocurrency and traditional finance are coming together. Last week Gemini 
 it struck a deal with CBOE Holdings Inc. to help the Chicago-based exchange create a futures contract based on bitcoin. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month issued its 
 on digital assets and the exchanges where they trade, saying most coins are likely to meet the definition of a security and the markets where they trade need to register with the regulator.
And the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in July 
 final approval for LedgerX LLC to offer options contracts on bitcoin. The LedgerX and CBOE approach includes a clearinghouse standing in the middle of all trades, which will give those efforts more legitimacy in many traders’ eyes, said Dan Hodd, co-founder of Digital Asset Investment Co., a hedge fund focused on trading digital assets.
“One of the biggest challenges in this whole space is translating the capability of this new technology and the assets that come with it to the traditional financial system,” said Hodd, who previously traded equity swaps at Citigroup Inc. “It has to fit both sides of the puzzle.”
The industry is progressing in terms of the volume of transactions on exchanges and the ease of trading, Tyler Winklevoss, who founded Gemini with his brother Cameron, said in an interview. “It’s a huge step” to be developing futures contracts based on bitcoin that will trade at CBOE, he said. “You can’t expect a child who’s learning to walk to sprint, there has to be a sequence to it.” Gemini is regulated as a New York state chartered limited liability trust company.
The number of bitcoin trades on Gemini and GDAX jumped earlier this year. While in February, Gemini’s volume hit just over 85,000, the next month it was more than 160,000, according to data from TradeBlock. GDAX transactions went from just over 171,000 to nearly 350,000 in the same span, according to TradeBlock.
“Over time all the technology becomes more fluid, better and easier to use,” Cameron Winklevoss said in an interview. “When we first got into bitcoin, we had to go to Mt. Gox,” Tyler said. The former head of Mt. Gox, the bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange that imploded in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of the cryptocurrency, began his trial last month. Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles pleaded not guilty in Tokyo to charges of embezzlement and inflating corporate financial accounts.
The growing pains at the exchanges should be expected at this stage of the industry’s development, said Mas Nakachi, an adviser to fintech companies who’s spent nearly 15 years on Wall Street as an analyst and former CEO of OpenGamma, a software provider that specializes in derivatives. When Nakachi was trying to learn the Solidity coding language that is used to create the ethereum blockchain, he could only find one book on it on Amazon.com.
“When was the last time there was only one book on Java? The early ’90s?” he said in an interview. “The biggest misconception coming from the institutional side is the definition of an exchange,” Nakachi said. Traditional markets segregate customer accounts and use clearinghouses to guarantee trades, among other security and operational measures, Nakachi said. “When people refer to exchanges in the crypto space, there is none of that.”
He’d like to see more steps like the ones taken by LedgerX and CBOE, which will use clearinghouses and other familiar market operations. Clearinghouses collect cash and securities like U.S. Treasuries to ensure if a trader fails there’s enough money to cover losses. They also monitor risk on a daily basis and liquidate positions if traders can’t meet their margin call.
“It’s so early it should be expected” that there are things that still need to be done, he said, “but that’s what the institutional guys are finding as they tiptoe into the space.”

=== Title: U.S. Signals Clampdown on Red-Hot Digital Coin Offerings - Bloomberg ===

U.S. regulators said they have jurisdiction over one of the hottest new areas of finance: initial coin offerings of digital currencies.
Companies that raise money through the sale of digital assets must adhere to federal securities laws, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
 Tuesday. Issuers must register the deals with the government unless they have a valid excuse, as should exchanges that offer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, the regulator said.
“It’s been a long time coming and this is a big deal,” said Angela Walch, associate professor at St. Mary’s University School of Law. “People have been waiting for some kind of signal from regulators on ICOs.” This is the most detailed the SEC has been about how digital currencies and the exchanges where they trade fit into financial markets, she said. “It’s a reminder that basic consumer protection principles still apply” in the digital asset world, she added. “The tech people coming in don’t necessarily realize they’re playing with fire.”
Startups have 
 selling such tokens in 2017, bypassing traditional initial public offerings of shares -- a process overseen by the SEC -- in favor of so-far mostly unregulated ICOs. The commission examined the sale of tokens to fund a startup known as the DAO last year, which raised about $150 million over four weeks, according to the SEC’s investigative report released Tuesday.
The agency’s enforcement division was asked to decide if the DAO token sales “violated federal securities laws with unregistered offers and sales of DAO Tokens in exchange for ‘Ether,’ a virtual currency,” the report said. The SEC decided not to bring charges in the DAO token sale case.
Instead, the SEC report said it wanted “to caution the industry and market participants: the federal securities laws apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology.”
One recent ICO was led by 
, a prediction market application based on the Ethereum blockchain. It raised $12.5 million in 12 minutes on April 24, resulting in a market value of almost $300 million. It’s generated no revenue and has little more than a white paper describing what it intends to do. Yet its tokens, which would allow users to bet on things such as election outcomes, have soared 200 percent since early May, according to Coinmarketcap.com.
An open question is whether the SEC will apply these new standards to coin offerings that have already happened, said Walch, who is also a research fellow at the Centre for Blockchain Technologies at University College London. And while the SEC won’t pursue action related to the DAO token sale, “I don’t see anything in here that says there won’t be enforcement actions against others,” she said. Some recent ICO have been “egregious,” she said. “I’d be very surprised if they were willing to shove them all under the rug.”
The SEC decision comes a day after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
 LedgerX LLC approval to offer options trading based on bitcoin. That could help mature the business of bitcoin trading by helping traders offset risks with derivatives. But it also underscored the fact that digital currencies, decentralized technologies that appeal to the libertarian-minded, probably cannot escape governments.
ICOs offer an attractive deal to young companies: going directly to customers for funding, avoiding venture-capital firms and other professionals. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton addressed the balance he’s trying to strike, saying in the regulator’s statement that, “We seek to foster innovative and beneficial ways to raise capital, while ensuring -- first and foremost -- that investors and our markets are protected.”
“What the SEC did not say is that all tokens are securities. Rather, they suggest a facts-and-circumstances test,” Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at Coin Center, said in an email. “We believe that applying the same facts-and-circumstances test to other tokens will mean that some do not fit into the definition of securities, particularly tokens with an underlying utility rather than a mere speculative investment value.”
Markets such as Coinbase Inc.’s GDAX and Gemini Trust Co. that offer trading in digital assets so far have dealt mostly with state, not federal, regulators. The SEC now says that will likely change. “Additionally, securities exchanges providing for trading in these securities must register unless they are exempt,” the agency said.
Calling that a “big deal,” Walch said, “Those in the crypto world have been acting as if they live in an alternate universe, and the SEC has delivered a reminder that they still live in the real world, with real investors and real people making decisions that they must be accountable for.”

=== Title: The 45-Millisecond Ether Flash Crash Prompts Safeguard Effort - Bloomberg ===

Last week’s flash crash in the ethereum digital currency prompted the venue where it happened to consider safeguards used in other markets such as stocks.
Circuit breakers that would pause trading to prevent accidents from spiraling out of control and a system of incentives to lure market makers who’d help keep prices from dropping too far are among the options under consideration, according to Adam White, general manager of 
’s GDAX market.
Coinbase has consulted with the New York Stock Exchange and other experts on how to prevent flash crashes, White said, though he declined to give details. NYSE Group 
 in Coinbase.
The crash at 3:30 p.m. New York time on June 21 drove the currency down to 10 cents from $317.81. The cause, White said, was a single $12.5 million trade -- one of the biggest ever -- placed by a customer as a market order, or a request to sell immediately. That pushed ethereum to $224.48, but the pain didn’t end there. The decline triggered sell orders from traders who’d requested to bail on the currency if prices fell to certain levels, and prompted GDAX to liquidate some margin trades.
It all happened in just 45 milliseconds, White said in an interview. That’s when computer algorithms started buying, driving prices back up to $300 within 10 seconds, he added.
“This was not long, sustained, panicked selling,” White said. “It was a very rapid, cascading event followed by aware and intelligent programmatic traders buying.”
Ether fell 4.8 percent to $288.50 on Friday afternoon, according to data compiled by Coindesk.com.
Preventing the next digital currency flash crash might depend on learning lessons from the stock market, where an infamous 2010 rout prompted a series of rule changes to safeguard investors and prevent lightning-fast losses in an increasingly automated trading environment. A system of circuit breakers that briefly halts a stock when it falls too much was put in place, later augmented by a less onerous system that prevents market makers from quoting outside certain price bands.
The stock market still sees sudden losses, such as a 
 in many large technology shares on June 9, but there’s been no repeat of the 2010 rout.
White said he’s considering bringing more market makers to his venue because last week’s event suggests there weren’t enough buy orders at his exchange to cushion the blow. Market makers aren’t charged to trade on GDAX, said White, and his company is looking at paying them a rebate.
“Although we offer the deepest book, it wasn’t sufficiently deep enough based on that $12.5 million market sell,” he said.
GDAX may also introduce a maximum order size, White said. (Other possibilities were discussed in a 
 Friday.) Right now, customers who place trades that GDAX thinks will push prices down significantly are warned with a dialog box. The customer who placed the $12.5 million order overrode that message to complete their transaction, White said.

=== Title: Ronald Reagan Auction Rakes In A Staggering $5.7 Million - Bloomberg ===

In the midst of a contentious American election cycle, nostalgia for the Reagan years proved robust this week, as more than 400 lots from the former president and first lady’s estate soared past their high estimates to total more than $5.74 million 
.
While the sale's 
 was almost aggressively conservative, few could predict that much of Reagan memorabilia would sell for 1,000 percent or 2,000 percent above its official valuations. A 
, replete with presidential seal, carried a high estimate of $20,000 and sold for $199,500. A page of pencil sketches, doodled on White House stationery and signed “Ronald Reagan,” was estimated to sell for $3,500; an eager buyer 
.
The list goes on: An 
, signed by Ronald Reagan and inscribed “Win One For The Gipper,” sold for $93,750 over a high estimate of $10,000; 
 of the Berlin wall, signed by Reagan and decorated in neon graffiti, was meant to sell for $20,000 and sold for $277,500; even 
 from the president’s desk, including a glass jar filled with Reagan's famously-beloved jelly beans, sold for $32,500, 1,500 percent above its high estimate of $1,000.
This kind of presidential bidding frenzy has a precedent in the form of the 
 at Sotheby's. More than 6,000 of the former first lady's belongings carried a pre-sale estimate of $4.6 million and ended up totaling more than $34 million. An oak rocking chair that Kennedy used in the White House sold for $442,000; a plastic model of Air Force One sold for $48,875; and even Onassis’s 1992 BMW 325i, estimated to sell for $22,000, sold for $72,500. The mixture of nostalgia, celebrity, and glamour proved irresistible.
Those same impulses seemed to be in play during the Reagans’ two-day sale on Wednesday and Thursday. And while the distinctly presidential pieces of memorabilia did particularly well, more intimate, domestic relics also exceeded expectations. A 
, monogrammed with the words “Reagan’s Bar,” sold for $7,500 above a high estimate of $400, and 
 from 1984, inscribed with the slogan “You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet,” sold for $71,250 over a high estimate of $1,500.
Nancy Reagan proved to be as compelling as her husband. Her 
 by Bulgari, estimated to sell for $8,000, was the auction’s leading lot, totaling (with premium) $319,500. A pair of 
 bearing the monogram N R (a gift from Margaret Thatcher) carried an estimate of $2,000 and sold for $52,000.
The prices paid for the lots was certainly a draw, but—much like the Onassis sale 20 years ago—the auction provided an irresistible glimpse into the life of two of the world’s most powerful personalities. Reagan, who 
 several Westerns, seemed to favor cowboy memorabilia; no fewer than seven artworks in the auction depict men on horseback. (Sample titles: 
 and 
.) There were also a series of gifts from various admirers, including 
 given by Frank Sinatra on the occasion of Reagan’s first inauguration. (It sold for $106,250, above a high estimate of $10,000.)
While the live auction has ended, an additional 260 lots are currently on offer in a 
 that will culminate on Sept. 28. Proceeds of both auctions will benefit the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute.
 
 

=== Title: Here Are the Big Names Who Are Backing and Slamming Bitcoin - Bloomberg ===

Is bitcoin a legitimate asset, or a super-bubble waiting to implode? As prices for the cryptocurrency skyrocket, investors and pundits are increasingly taking sides.
Whether you’re a backer or a detractor, what’s not in doubt is bitcoin’s dizzying rally this year. The most widely used digital currency crossed the $7,000 mark on Thursday and is up more than 650 percent in 2017. It’s managed to whip past the 
 total value mark despite governmental crackdowns and mainstream market skepticism. Bitcoin was trading at $7,218 at 9:37 a.m. New York time on Friday.
With the rhetoric for and against heating up this week amid bitcoin’s barreling gains, here’s a look at where some big names in finance stand -- from those who see it as the natural evolution of money, to the naysayers waiting for the asset to crash and burn.

=== Title: Bitcoin Surges Past $4,000 on Speed Breakthrough - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin soared past $4,000 for the first time on growing optimism faster transaction times will hasten the spread of the cryptocurrency.
The largest digital tender jumped to a peak of $4,298 Monday, a gain of nearly 20 percent since Friday, after a plan to quicken trade execution by moving some data off the main network was activated last week. The solution -- termed SegWit2x -- had been so contentious that a new version of the asset called Bitcoin Cash was spun off earlier this month in opposition.
The split grew out of the tension between growing demand for the virtual currency and some of the design features that had fueled that popularity -- the decentralized verification procedures that ensured against hacking and government oversight. While this month’s confrontation ended up as little more than a speed bump in bitcoin’s more than 300 percent rally in 2017, concerns remain around the capacity to increase transaction volumes.
“Up until now a lot of people didn’t really believe bitcoin could go any higher until the scaling issue is resolved,” said Arthur Hayes, Hong Kong-based founder of bitcoin exchange 
. “With this actually being implemented on protocol, theoretically the amount of transactions that can be processed at a reasonable speed is going to be much higher, so a lot of people are very bullish about bitcoin now.”
Because of a cap on the amount of data processed by bitcoin’s blockchain, transactions started to slow as its popularity boomed. The community was then divided between the SegWit2x solution backed by a group of developers and another supported by miners that sought a larger increase in the block size. The latter then became Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin Cash, whose price has retreated since peaking right after its birth, has neither disrupted its progenitor’s operations nor undercut its appeal.
While SegWit2x has garnered enough support for activation, challenges remain. Its next stage involves doubling the block size to 2 megabytes some time in November, a possibility that’s still mired in debate. Reduced support could thwart this step, with some arguing that Bitcoin Cash -- with a block size of 8 megabytes -- has obviated the need for another “hard fork” to upgrade the bitcoin again, Hayes said.
The cryptocurrency’s staggering price surge has bolstered related businesses. Digital currency exchange Coinbase Inc. 
 Thursday it’s received a $100 million investment. The supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million, compared with 16.5 million that had been mined as of Saturday, according to blockchain.info.
“People are starting to price in the consumer demand from Coinbase’s $100 million fund-raising round,” said Justin Short, London-based founder of trading platform Nous. “That’s a lot of advertising budget. Every $1 million of marketing brings new demand, which increases the price as the supply is limited by design.”
Goldman Sachs technical analyst Sheba Jafari wrote in a note to clients Sunday that bitcoin could reach as high as $4,827 before entering a correction, which could erase around 40 percent of the cryptocurrency’s gains.
"This can last at least one third of the time it took to complete the preceding advance and retrace at least 38.2 percent of the entire move," Jafari said. "From current levels, that would measure out to $2,221” prior to today’s surge.

=== Title: Tulip Fever Review, a Rare Love Story for Finance Geeks - Bloomberg ===

Markets are governed by two things: math and story.
Math is simple. It’s reality, the fundamentals and the underlying supply and demand for whatever’s being traded. The story is where human psychology enters the picture. It’s what causes people to extrapolate wildly, move in herds, and swing from bouts of extreme pessimism to embarrassing optimism. Markets can whipsaw wildly based on story alone, though in the end, raw math eventually wins out.
Markets are at their most exciting when the gap between math and story is massive, when humans are fully in the driver’s seat and prices no longer bear any resemblance to reality. With this in mind, a financial bubble is the perfect setting for a romantic drama because, well, love is the other obvious area where the stories we tell and get swept up in can diverge so sharply from actuality.
This is the premise of 
, a film set in 17th century Amsterdam during tulip mania, an historic episode that’s come to be synonymous with bubbles. Based on the 1999 Deborah Moggach novel of the same name, 
 tells the story of a wealthy Dutchman, Cornelis Sandvoort (Christoph Waltz), and his beautiful, bored young wife, Sophia (Alicia Vikander), who falls in love with Jan (Dane DeHaan), a painter commissioned to make the couple’s portrait.
You might expect the love aspects of the plot to predominate and the markets part to get short shrift. But in 
 it’s the financial story that’s fascinating, while the romantic angle for the couple is a little tired. In the end, I just didn’t care if Sophia and Jan worked things out.
The film does provide multiple interesting lessons on the nature of money and wealth, though. At one point, Jan explains to Sophia that the stunning blue found in the great Renaissance paintings was called “ultramarine” because it had to be imported with great difficulty from across the sea. The value of a commodity can come not only from its utility but also from the difficulty of its attainment.
Meanwhile, the exchange of the actual tulip bulbs is particularly illuminating. While the trading takes place in a tavern, filled with drunks and prostitutes, the bulbs themselves are left for safekeeping in an abbey. This dichotomy between a rowdy bar and a house of worship is a perfect manifestation of Karl Marx’s essay “The Power of Money.” In it, Marx credits Shakespeare with identifying two essential properties of money: At times it’s divine, and at times it’s “the common whore of mankind,” as the Bard wrote in 
.
The film emphasizes—perhaps overemphasizes—how similar love and bubbles are. Sophia and Jan hatch a plot to escape together that involves a faked pregnancy, a faked death, and an overnight fortune made trading tulips. Only in their wildest fever dream could they really have thought it would work (just like the speculators who believed the price of tulip bulbs would only go up). In the end, the cold reality of their situation (the math) wins out. Their plan results in predictable catastrophe.
The director, Justin Chadwick, still manages to end on an implausibly feel-good note, one that seems discordant with how bubbles and heartbreaks typically culminate. Of course, the mere existence of the film is kind of a happy ending, as the production was beset by numerous impediments over the years that slowed its release. There just aren’t enough movies that delve into finance and the nature of money, so it’s a good thing this one finally came out.

=== Title: Microsoft Faulted Over Ransomware While Shifting Blame to NSA - Bloomberg ===

There’s a blame game brewing over who’s responsible for the massive cyberattack that infected hundreds of thousands of computers. Microsoft Corp. is pointing its finger at the U.S. government, while some experts say the software giant is accountable too.
The attack started Friday and has affected computers in more than 150 countries, including severe disruptions at Britain’s National Health Service. The hack used a technique purportedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency to target Microsoft’s market-leading Windows operating system. It effectively takes the computer hostage and demands a $300 ransom, to be paid in 72 hours with bitcoin.
Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith 
 the NSA’s practice of developing hacking methods to use against the U.S. government’s 
. The problem is that once those vulnerabilities become public, they can be used by others. In March, thousands of leaked Central Intelligence Agency documents exposed vulnerabilities in smartphones, televisions and software built by Apple Inc., Google and Samsung Electronics Co.
The argument that it’s the NSA’s fault has merit, according to Alex Abdo, staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. Still, he said Microsoft should accept some responsibility. 
“Technology companies owe their customers a reliable process for patching security vulnerabilities,” he said. “When a design flaw is discovered in a car, manufacturers issue a recall. Yet, when a serious vulnerability is discovered in software, many companies respond slowly or say it’s not their problem.'”
Microsoft released a patch for the flaw in March after hackers stole the exploit from the NSA. But some organizations didn’t apply it, and others were running older versions of Windows that Microsoft no longer supports. In what it said was a  “highly unusual” step, Microsoft also agreed to provide the patch for older versions of Windows, including Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. 
In 2014, Microsoft 
 for the highly popular Windows XP, released in 2001 and engineered beginning in the late 1990s, arguing that the software was out of date and wasn't built with modern security safeguards.  The company had already been supporting it longer than it normally would have because so many customers still used it and the effort was proving costly. Security patches would be available for clients with older machines, but only if they paid for custom support agreements.
But with Microsoft making an exception this time and providing the patch free to XP users, it may come under pressure to do the same next time it issues a critical security update. (These are the most important patches that the company recommends users install immediately). That could saddle the company with the XP albatross for many years past when it hoped to be free from having to maintain the software. The precedent may impact other software sellers too.
“They’re going to end up going above and beyond and some vendors are going to start extending support for out-of-support things that they haven’t done before,” said Greg Young, an analyst at market research firm Gartner Inc. “That’s going to become a more common practice.”
On Monday,  private-sector sleuths found a clue about potentially who’s responsible for the WannaCrypt attack.  A researcher from Google 
 that an early version of WannaCrypt from February shared some of the same programming code as malicious software used by the Lazarus Group, the alleged North Korean government hackers behind the destructive attack on Sony Corp. in 2014 and the theft of $81 million from a Bangladesh central bank account at the New York Fed last year. Others subsequently confirmed the Google researcher’s work.
On its own, the shared code is little more than an intriguing lead. Once malicious software is in the wild, it is commonly reused by hacking groups, especially nation-states trying to leave the fingerprints of another country. But in this case, 
, the shared code was removed from the versions of WannaCrypt that are currently circulating, which reduces the likelihood of such a ‘false flag’ attempt at misdirection. Some security researchers speculated that if the perpetrators were North Korean, the goal may have been to cause a widespread internet outage to coincide with this weekend’s latest missile test.
As for Microsoft, some intelligence agency experts questioned its NSA criticism, saying it’s unreasonable for the company to ask governments to stop using its products as a way to attack and monitor enemies.
“For Microsoft to say that governments should stop developing exploits to Microsoft products is naive,” said Brian Lord, a managing director at PGI Cyber and former deputy director at the Government Communications Headquarters, one of the U.K.’s intelligence agencies. “To keep the world safe these things have to be done.”
He said that intelligence agencies tended to be good and responsible stewards of the hacks and exploits they develop. “Occasionally mistakes happen,” he added.

=== Title: Cyberattack Is Blunted as Governments, Companies Gain Upper Hand - Bloomberg ===

Governments and companies around the world began to gain the upper hand against the first wave of an unrivaled global 
, even as the assault was poised to continue claiming victims this week. 
More than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries have so far been infected, according to Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre said new cases of so-called ransomware are possible “at a significant scale.”
"For now, it does not look like the number of infected computers is increasing," said a Europol spokesman. "We will get a decryption tool eventually, but for the moment, it’s still a live threat and we’re still in disaster recovery mode."
At Germany’s national Deutsche Bahn railroad, workers were laboring under "high pressure" Monday to repair remaining glitches with train stations’ electronic departure boards, a spokesman said.
French car-maker 
, which halted production at some factories to stop the virus from spreading, said 90 percent of factories worldwide had now resumed operations, according to a spokesman Monday.
A new version of the ransomware may have also been spreading over the weekend. 
, founder of United Arab Emirates-based cyber security firm Comae Technologies, said around 10,000 machines have been infected by the second variation of the malware.
The malware used a technique purportedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency. It affected the U.K.’s National Health Service, Russia’s Ministry of Interior, China government agencies, Deutsche Bahn, automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Renault, PetroChina, logistics giant FedEx Corp., and other company and hospital computer systems in countries from Eastern Europe to the U.S. and Asia.
The hackers used the tool to encrypt files within affected computers, making them inaccessible, and demanded ransom -- typically $300 in bitcoin. Russia and Ukraine had a heavy concentration of infections, according to Dutch security company Avast Software BV.
Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith, in a 
 Sunday, said the attack is a “wake-up call” for governments in the U.S. and elsewhere to stop stockpiling tools to exploit digital vulnerabilities. “They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world,” he said.
About 97 percent of U.K. facilities and doctors disabled by the attack were back to normal operation, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Saturday after a government meeting. At the height of the attack Friday and early Saturday, 48 organizations in the NHS were affected, and hospitals in London, North West England and Central England urged people with non-emergency conditions to stay away as technicians tried to stop the spread of the malicious software.
The initial attack was stifled when a security researcher disabled a key mechanism used by the worm to spread, but experts said the hackers were likely to mount a second attack because so many users of personal computers with Microsoft operating systems couldn’t or didn’t download a security patch released in March that Microsoft had labeled “critical.”
Microsoft said in a blog post Saturday that it was taking the “highly unusual“ step of providing the patch for older versions of Windows it was otherwise no longer supporting, including Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
While the scale of the attack shows Microsoft needs to strengthen its own capabilities, “there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their system,” Smith said in his blog post. “Otherwise they’re literally fighting the problems of the present with tools from the past.
“This attack is a powerful reminder that information technology basics like keeping computers current and patched are a high responsibility for everyone, and it’s something every top executive should support."
Victims have paid about $50,000 in ransom so far, with the total expected to rise, said Tom Robinson, chief operating officer and co-founder of Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a ransomware consultant that works with banks and companies in the U.K., U.S. and Europe. Robinson, in an interview by email, said he calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands.
Last year an acute-care hospital in Hollywood paid 
 to an extortionist who hijacked its computer systems and forced doctors and staff to revert to pen and paper for record-keeping.
A spokesman for Spain’s Telefonica SA said the hack affected some employees at its headquarters, but the phone company is attacked frequently and the impact of Friday’s incident wasn’t major. FedEx said it was “experiencing interference,” the Associated Press reported.
Renault halted production at some factories to stop the virus from spreading, a spokesman said Saturday, while Nissan’s car plant in Sunderland, in northeast England, was affected without causing any major impact on business, an official said.
Russia’s Interior Ministry, with oversight of the police forces, said about “1,000 computers were infected,” which it described as less than 1 percent of the total, according to its website.
In China, the malware affected computers at “several” unspecified government departments, the country’s Cyberspace Administration said on its WeChat blog Monday. Since that initial attack, agencies and companies from the police to banks and communications firms have put preventive measures in place, while Qihoo 360 Technology Co., 
 and other cybersecurity firms have begun making protection tools available, the internet overseer said.
China National Petroleum Corp., which owns PetroChina, reported that some of its 21,000 gas stations had seen their digital payment systems disabled by the attack and resorted to accepting cash. More than 80 percent of the stations had been reconnected to the network as of noon on May 14, the company said. Several Chinese universities had also been hit by the attacks, according to 
 reports.
In Japan, 
 said that some of its computers had been affected. In South Korea, 
, the country’s largest cinema chain, said advertising servers and displays at film theaters were hit by ransomware. Movie servers weren’t affected and are running as normal, it said in a text message Monday. Indonesia’s government reported two hospitals in Jakarta were affected.
While any size company could be vulnerable, many large organizations with robust security departments would have prioritized the update that Microsoft released in March and wouldn’t be vulnerable to Friday’s attack.
Ransomware is a particularly stubborn problem because victims are often tricked into allowing the malicious software to run on their computers, and the encryption happens too fast for security software to catch it. Some security experts calculate that ransomware may bring in as much as $1 billion a year in revenue for the attackers.
The attack was apparently halted in the afternoon in the U.K. when a researcher took control of an Internet domain that acted as a kill switch for the worm’s propagation, 
“I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after I registered it, so initially it was accidental,” wrote the researcher, who uses the Twitter name 
. “So long as the domain isn’t revoked, this particular strain will no longer cause harm, but patch your systems ASAP as they will try again.”
A second variant of the domain also became apparent. 
, founder of Comae Technologies, said on Sunday he registered another kill-switch for a different version of the ransomware. About 50% of machines that would have spread the infection by the second variation of the malware have Russian I.P. addresses, according to Suiche.
There is a high probability that Russian-language cybercriminals were behind the attack, said Aleks Gostev, chief cybersecurity expert for Kaspersky Labs.
“Ransomware is traditionally their topic,” he said. “The geography of attacks that hit post-Soviet Union most also suggests that.”

=== Title: Digital Coin Euphoria Wipes Away Tech Selloff for Nvidia and AMD - Bloomberg ===

The two-week selloff in tech shares that wiped hundreds of billions in value from the sector’s biggest names is over for two of the highest flying chipmakers.
Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have all but erased losses that began June 8, with each rallying at least 5 percent in the past two days, even as broader measures of tech shares remain more than 2 percent from recent highs.
Thank cryptocurrency 
 for the latest round of bullishness, says Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell. They’re buying up Nvidia and AMD graphics cards in an attempt to unlock the code to digital coins like ether and bitcoin.
“The sharp increase in demand from cryptocurrency miners has rapidly depleted excess channel inventory” for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, the analyst wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. “Surging demand from cryptocurrency miners in China and Eastern Europe since early May” will boost quarterly unit sales by as much as 20 percent, the analyst predicted, a sharp turnaround from his prior forecast that saw at least a 10 percent contraction in sales.
McConnell joins a growing list who are considering the impact on chip sales from computer scientists mining for digital currencies. Earlier this month, Bank of America Corp. analyst Vivek Arya 
 to a Street-high of $185, citing the use of the semiconductor company’s graphics processing units (GPUs) for mining as part of his thesis. GPUs aren’t powerful enough yet for the complexity of mining bitcoin, but Nvidia and AMD are 
 working on GPUs specifically for this.
The Pacific Crest analyst upgraded Nvidia to sector weight Tuesday, the equivalent of a hold, while raising quarterly estimates for AMD. Nvidia added 1.4 percent to $159.08 as of 2:10 p.m. in New York, within pennies of erasing a 6.5 percent slump since June 8, when it closed at an all-time high. It’s rallied nearly 50 percent this year. AMD pushed its two-day rally to 13 percent, enough to erase the effects of six-day rout.
Still, McConnell noted that the boost in demand from miners may not be sustainable, saying that “desktop graphics card manufacturers are skeptical,” in light of a similar surge in demand in 2013 during another period of bitcoin euphoria that had no long-term effect on chipmaker sales. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Toshiya Hari isn’t convinced either, and 
 rating on AMD earlier this month.

=== Title: Europe's Cyber Victims Are Racking Up Hundreds of Millions in Costs - Bloomberg ===

Global hackers have unleashed a brace of attacks in recent months, but while their haul in bitcoin has been 
, the revenue hit to companies infected is reaching into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
The WannaCry ransomware that spread in May featured a flawed design that led to its prompt 
, and June’s computer virus called Petya was designed to 
 rather than collect money. The two attacks netted the attackers around $140,000, according to analysis of their bitcoin wallets.
The fallout for companies affected is proving costlier. Nivea skin-cream maker 
 said Thursday that Petya cost 35 million euros ($41.5 million) in first-half sales. The company has yet to report the costs of held inventory and halted production in 17 plants. Computers at its Hamburg headquarters and nearly 160 global offices were also knocked off-line. “We have worked here day and night, 24/7, across the globe," Chief Executive Officer Stefan Heidenreich told analysts.
Reckitt Benckiser, the U.K.-based maker of Dettol cleaners and Durex condoms, last week 
 90 million pounds off its expected sales this year after the June attack knocked 2,000 servers and 15,000 company laptops out of commission. The company was still manufacturing at less than full 
 in July. French building materials manufacturer 
 said July 27 the cyber-attack would 
 about 250 million euros in 
 this year.
“I don’t think you can model a cyber attack," said Robert Waldschmidt, an analyst at 
in London, who covers Reckitt and Beiersdorf. “Companies can only try their best to prepare defenses. This may mean that IT and consulting costs need to rise a bit to improve these defenses and or implement new ones."
Danish shipping company 
 A/S told customers last week it’s still clearing 
 from a shutdown of its online ordering system after its machines were 
 by malware.
Companies are now piling up the sandbags in the expectation of another attack. Germany’s national 
 railroad created a “cyber rapid deployment force” of highly trained IT specialists with computer-threat experience to be available around the clock against future attacks, a spokesman said. The group restored service to ticket machines and departure boards after the WannaCry attack, he said.
U.K. advertising agency 
 plans to 
 more in thwarting hackers after a Petya infection spread across the group, which Chief Executive Officer Martin Sorrell called “an increased cost of doing business.” 
These costs can be hard for investors to estimate. “Saint-Gobain has spent some cash to respond to the attack and says it’s in a more solid position now to face future attacks," said Eric Lemarie, an analyst at Bryan Garnier & Co. in Paris. “They say they will implement some IT programs a bit differently, but that’s it, really. The group hasn’t really provided a specific figure that would need to be spent in the future to manage this risk."
The resulting hundreds of millions in lost sales among European groups may be dwarfed by the 
 at American firms including 
, 
 and speech software maker 
However, fewer European companies are 
 against cyberattacks than American groups, creating market 
 for insurers including Allianz, 
, Munich Re and 
, Charles Graham, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said. Saint-Gobain’s CFO last week said cyber-attack related damage isn’t typically covered by insurance contracts.
Lloyd’s of London said in a report last month a potential global cyber attack could wreak as much financial damage as Hurricane Katrina, and 
 the the worldwide cyber-insurance market is worth between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. It could rise to between $8.5 billion and $10 billion by 2020, according to Munich Re.
Spending by companies and governments to update old systems like ones that fell prey to WannaCry and Petya makes cyber security “an attractive multi-year” investment, said Patrick Kolb, who manages a $520 million IT security and safety fund at Credit Suisse. 
“’If it’s not broken do not fix it’ simply doesn’t work for IT security," he said. “The financial impact from business disruption is likely to be far larger than $300 of ransom.”
It could cost companies a few million euros in the short term to gird IT systems against further attacks, and expenditures could hit the bottom line each year if the breaches keep coming, said Liberum’s Waldschmidt. “After the attack you can endeavor to model it and need to consider how extensive the hit was and how long business will be impacted," he said “It’s similar to modeling a holiday such as Easter."

=== Title: The 2016 Volvo XC90, a New SUV, Is Safe, Square, and ... Sexy? - Bloomberg ===

Most of the time, when you need a technology tutorial, it’s with a new computer or an extensive sound system.
For cars, I figure I don’t need one.
So I was skeptical when company execs wanted to send someone with the 2016 Volvo XC90 T6 they delivered to me last week in New York. We need to have someone walk you through our new systems, they said. Oh brother, I thought.
Good thing they insisted. 
Otherwise how would I have known how to use the automatic driving system that steers, accelerates, and brakes for me in tangled traffic? How would I have known to use the parking system that wedges the sizeable car into the most infinitely small East Village spaces you can imagine—places even my kid brother wouldn’t attempt in his little Citroen. 
With the XC90, believe me, you’ll feel the same way I did. You’re going to want all the upfront tech help you can get. If you’re not lucky enough to have someone patient walk you through everything, you may end up feeling like a caveman in a physics class.
The $48,900 Volvo XC90 is the most important car the Gothenburg (Sweden)-based company has produced in two decades. Volvo has a lot riding on this effort: It’s the first of a slew of brand-new models Volvo says it will bring to market by 2019 and it’s the first model Volvo has produced under its new China-based parent company, Geely. You can insert your low-quality, China-made joke here—a lot of people really care about the perception of Chinese-made products, especially those who are buying products that are considered luxury items.
So this SUV needs to make a good first impression.
Virtually every luxury auto brand—even such longstanding holdouts as Bentley—are making at least one SUV model. Many are making several. The segment has continued to grow steadily for a decade.
But Volvo hasn’t had a new XC90—or any true SUV—in more than a decade. Even consumers who knew and loved Volvo were forced to defect to other brands such as Audi and BMW if they wanted a fresh SUV. That led to stagnated sales at Volvo while Audi, BMW, Land Rover, and Mercedes-Benz offered exciting and posh new SUVs like the Q7, X5, Range Rover, and GL, respectively.
It stands to reason that Volvo would have been hyping this thing for the past year. It's the clean-sheet redesign of an entire segment entry. And its success or failure will set the tone for the seven models Volvo will release over the next half-decade—replacements for the current range and some new hybrid variants. 
On to the car! I like it. As far as looks go, I like its bold erect grill, those T-shaped LED headlamps, and the 21-inch rims (19-inch ones on the base model, and 22-inch rims are available for an additional $1,000). I appreciate the still-square shape of the side windows (this is Volvo, after all) and the long and tall bright red tail lights flipped up on each side of the back. Very handsome. It is big: three rows of seats, but it's still nearly 9 inches shorter than the Cadillac Escalade. The XC90 is potentially tricky to park because of its challenging size, but those cameras and self-parking help entirely). The look comes as a welcome change to the Audi/BMW/Merc revolving-door styling of SUVs we’ve been seeing lately. It makes me think of those totally square Volvo wagons my friends in Oregon drove during high school. Square but so cool.
Inside, it’s apparent that Volvo has taken every opportunity to prove this is a genuine Swedish product. (Maintaining a close connection to the company heritage is crucial for luxury brands.) This is evidenced by the latte-hued wood panels across the dashboard, doors, and console, by the sunroof that spans most of the roof, and by the tiny Swedish flags sewed into the shoulders of the front seats. The craftsmanship in this Scandinavian sanctuary equals, if not exceeds, all of its higher-priced competitors.
When you first slide into the driver’s seat, you’ll notice the tablet-sized screen in the middle of the dash. That is the god device. It controls all the new technology Volvo has flogged for a year: the four-zone climates, power heated and cooled seats, parking cameras galore, Bluetooth, the Bowers & Wilkins premium sound system ($2,500 extra), navigation, and so forth. I predict you’ll never use all the assets contained therein. They seem endless. 
I’m partial to the German model that uses knobs over touchscreen technology in cars because I like tactile feedback, rather than having to look down at some big iPhone screen every time I want to change the radio station. It feels distracting, even on a big 9-inch screen like this one, which allows you to flip pages as you would on a tablet.
In any event, you might then notice the “ignition,” a crystal knob protruding from near the center armrest. You twist it to start and stop the engine. Yes, it’s weird. Five drive modes (including comfort, eco and off-road) are controlled by a little hammered-silver roller scroller nearby. The shifter is right there, too, although the indicator that tells whether you’ve shifted into drive or reverse is situated behind the spokes of the steering wheel in tiny white lettering. (A more obvious location would have been better.) All vehicle functions are accessible via voice command, steering wheel thumb pads, and/or that touchscreen—which, by the way, is conveniently calibrated so you don’t need to remove your gloves in winter in order for it to register your touch.
The ride height, as you might expect, lends total command of the road, allowing for what feels like an unlimited perspective, perched high above the traffic. There are virtually no blind spots. Riding in it feels like riding in something with the dimensions of a shoebox framed only by metal bars: Space, air, and light flow through it uncontested.  
I did employ that back-back third-row seat several times, as various friends sat there to offer their take. Which was: “It’s doable.” But tight. Better for dogs and sporting equipment and 9-year-olds in time out. If you fold down the rear seats, on the other hand, you’ll feel like you’ve got the Great Plains back there. It’s miles (or 85 cubic feet) of unobstructed flat space. I did not use the integrated child booster seat, though I’m sure many will.
I’m keeping the driving impression part of this column for last because I expect that most buyers of the XC90 will be purchasing it for other reasons before they consider pure driving performance.
It’s still important for me to tell you that the XC90 AWD is not fast. Well, it is on paper. Zero to 60 miles per hour in 6.1 seconds is good; it beats a base Audi Q7 by more than one-and-a-half seconds. But it certainly doesn’t 
 fast. The 316 horsepower pushed by a four-cylinder turbo- 
supercharged engine lacks major torque. Moving through early gears, it feels pedestrian. At one point, as I entered the freeway from an on ramp, I floored the car and nothing happened. I almost looked down at my foot to make sure I had pushed the correct pedal. It was a momentary lag, but it was noticeable and frustrating.
As I said, I was driving the T6 model. Volvo will also offer a hybrid version—and, in Europe, a diesel version—although I applaud the natural efficiency of this base version. The XC90 gets 20 miles per gallon in the city and 25mpg on the highway, helped along by the fact that the steel safety cage of the car is more than 200 pounds lighter than its predecessor.  
The steering, however, feels lovely; you might even forget you’re pushing a truck. And the myriad safety prompts—it will indicate if a cyclist is in your drive path, if you’re about to hit a passing car, or if you might rear-end someone in front—stop just short of being overbearing. (Or worse, annoying.)
In fact, I can say point-blank that nothing about this car is annoying, not even the twist-top start/stop thing. It’s odd, but it works. This, to my mind, is the Volvo’s greatest strength in this luxury market it’s trying to enter. It’s different from everything else in the segment, and it's distinctly Scandanavian.
If the XC90 has any bearing on it—and it surely does—Volvo 2.0 is off to a very auspicious start.
 

=== Title: Forget $3,000, Bulls May Retreat If Bitcoin Breaks $2,877: Chart - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin’s more-than 20 percent slump this week on China’s reported plans to 
 cryptocurrency exchange trading has investors speculating when it will drop below the key psychological level of $3,000. But the level to watch may be just beyond that threshold: $2,877. Not only is that bitcoin’s intraday high on Aug. 4 -- about the time the digital currency’s most recent leg up began -- it’s also bitcoin’s current 100-day moving average. For Chris Weston, IG Ltd.’s chief market strategist in Melbourne, $2,877 is a “key line in the sand” and “the bulls will want to see this hold,” he said.

=== Title: Bitcoin Rally Boosts Smaller Cryptos Litecoin, Ether to Records - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin is giving its smaller cousins a hand.
Ether and litecoin, the second and fourth biggest cryptocurrencies, are surging to all-time highs on optimism that bitcoin futures will attract institutions to the fledgling market. The rallies come as speculators flock to Coinbase.com Inc., whose app last week climbed to the top of Apple Inc.’s download rankings. Known mainly as one of the easiest ways to trade bitcoin, the site also provides access to trading litecoin, ether and bitcoin cash.
Litecoin has more than doubled to as high as $401 since Dec. 10, before bitcoin derivatives started trading on Cboe Global Markets Inc., while ether has soared about 40 percent in that time to $633, according to CryptoCompare, a website tracking digital currency prices.
The crush to trade ether as it rallied Tuesday 
 Coinbase’s system, forcing the exchange to issue a notice saying “buys, sells temporarily disabled.” The incident persisted for over an hour.
The gains are even beating bitcoin’s advance as some traders move into digital assets that have lagged bitcoin’s 17-fold rally this year, and as others speculate there is more room to gain because of their smaller market capitalizations. All 20 of the biggest cryptocurrencies are rising today, according to CoinMarketCap, with litecoin advancing the most.
“It’s both, people are trading out of bitcoin, and new money coming to the space, and they’ll be thinking very simply, ‘how do I get more of these extraordinary returns?”’ said Charles Hayter, co-founder of CryptoCompare. “It’s herd-like mentality that takes off, which is very dangerous.”
Even litecoin’s creator Charlie Lee is warning that the run up in prices may be overdone. 
“Every crypto bull run I’ve seen has been followed by a bear cycle,” Lee tweeted Monday. “The market needs time to consolidate. That’s just my experience from seven years of watching this space.”

=== Title: Vintage Ford Broncos Are More Expensive Than Ever - Bloomberg ===

Last week in Arizona, car fans spent $259.8 million on vintage and collectable vehicles at 
.
It was $9 million more than last year, thanks largely to the success of million-dollar Ferraris and Jaguars, a group that saw double-digit increases in both the sell-through rate and the average sale price vs. 2016. 
Less expectedly, the market for cars below $100,000 saw record sell-through rates and above-market sale prices, too. This was true especially when it came to mainstream domestic cars such as the first-generation Ford Bronco.
“This interest has been surfacing for a while—the younger buyers love vintage SUVs,” said Jonathan Klinger, a spokesman for 
, a Michigan company that insures vintage and collectable cars.
Barrett-Jackson alone sold 12 of them in Scottsdale (“Interest in them continues to grow,” said Craig Jackson, chairman and chief executive officer of the eponymous auction house), with 21 offered throughout all auction houses for the week.
Their values have risen as well: The current average value of one in perfect condition is $47,025, according to Hagerty, vs. $23,400 five years ago. For one in drivable and generally good condition, but not perfect, the value is $29,188 vs. $14,500 five years ago.
To wit: A rare and highly restored 1968 Ford Bronco Custom pickup 
 at the Barrett-Jackson in Arizona, and Mecum sold one in Florida last week for $110,000, a world record price for 
. (The world record for any Bronco sold at auction is $500,000, for 
 sold in 2013.)
It all seems to indicate a new norm in the collector market today. While baby boomers dream of vintage muscle cars, millennials with money to spare want vintage SUVs. (And Ford is betting they’ll want new ones, too; an updated Bronco is expected to roll off production lines in 2020.)
The “first-generation” Broncos that Ford made from 1966 to 1977 are by far the most coveted. These were the cool metal squares set high on big, knobby rubber tires, often with no top at all.
The pilot seats inside were vinyl, with a simple, minimal dashboard design, a straightforward manual, three-speed transmission on a short wheelbase and choice of rugged, 105-horsepower straight-six or (later) V8 Ford engines that made them notoriously easy to repair.
“We think of the Bronco as neither a conventional car nor a truck, but as a vehicle which combines the best of both worlds,” then-Ford Vice President Donald Frey said in a press memo during the launch. “It can serve as a family sedan, a sports roadster, a snow plow, or a farm or civil defense vehicle. It has been designed to go anywhere and do nearly anything.”
Indeed, early Broncos came in wagon, truck, and roadster versions. They excelled at navigating uneven terrain and inclement conditions and were relatively cheap (around $2,404) at the time—the perfect competitor to the Jeep CJ-5 and International Harvester Scout. Ford made nearly 24,000 of them that first year.
While other vintage SUVs, such as the Toyota FJ Cruiser and the Land Rover Defender, have fielded high prices and wild popularity among cool-kid collectors in the U.S. since the turn of the last century, it took longer for Broncos to emerge. They just didn’t seem as special. (Maybe it had something to do with the residual image damage after O.J. Simpson’s White-Bronco-led police chase—though that one was not a first-generation specimen.)
That attitude is changing. Millennials were the first generation to mature parallel with the SUV phenomenon, which continues to 
 the new-car market. So it’s only natural that as time passes, that proximity and ensuing affinity would translate into increased appetite for vintage SUVs—especially American ones, which are cheaper and more reliable than their European counterparts.
The majority pull of the collector market still comes from baby boomers and Generation X, but not for long.
“Here in America we are an SUV culture, so for someone entering this hobby for the first time, they’ve spent more of their life in an SUV than someone in their 60s,” Klinger said. “We know that at some point this year online activity of millennials searching for collector car values will surpass that of baby boomers.”
Prices on these vintage jewels 
 
 depending on their condition, age, the amount of miles on the engine and the amount of restoration they’ve had. Some have been restored so heavily they’re like a whole new animal. Others are crashed, rusted and not drivable. (Many didn’t survive the abusive off-road duties for which they were designed, which only increases the desirability of the ones that did.)
Hemmings lists a 1969 version in white, with pristine burgundy interior, for 
; Autotrader lists them for 
, 
, 
, and everywhere in between. You can even get a bare-bones one for 
—though the likes of that require plenty of extra work. (That’s really part of the allure anyway.)
One of the biggest draws, besides those rugged good looks, is their simplicity. Broncos are reliable and easy to use, as far as vintage cars go. Where owning an older car is often like being in a dysfunctional relationship, with continual hurts and disappointments perpetrated by both parties (see: those sexy but finicky vintage Defenders), Broncos are “basically a handful of bolts on a body,” Klinger said.
It means you can repair, modify, and upgrade them to your heart’s content.
“The mechanicals are very common—most that you need are available at your local Napa Auto Parts store—and the interiors are just a heat-laminated vinyl seat form over foam, so they’re simple and rugged,” Klinger said. “You can really get mechanical satisfaction and mastery out of working on it.”
Ah, the dream of the hobbyist mechanic. It all sounds delightfully wholesome and good—the perfect anecdote to today’s computers-on-four-wheels.
Just don’t try it on those million-dollar Ferraris. They’re much less forgiving.

=== Title: Blankfein Says Don’t Dismiss Bitcoin - Bloomberg ===

Lloyd Blankfein isn’t sure what to make of bitcoin.
While the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief executive officer says he isn’t willing to reject the digital currency just yet and doesn’t hold any investments in the digital coin, he can see a world in which bitcoin is a form of currency.
“I read a lot of history, and I know that once upon a time, a coin was worth $5 if it had $5 worth of gold in it,” Blankfein said in an interview Thursday with Bloomberg TV. “Now we have paper that is just backed by fiat...Maybe in the new world, something gets backed by consensus.”
The digital currency got new impetus this week after CME Group Inc., the world’s largest exchange owner, said it plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the year, citing pent-up demand from clients. Skeptics including 
 say the rally is evidence that the software-created asset is a bubble that should not be given regulatory cover.
The speculation around bitcoin is the “very definition of a bubble,” Credit Suisse Group AG CEO 
 said at a news conference in Zurich Thursday.
“From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble,” Thiam said. He added that in the history of finance, such speculation has “rarely led to a happy end.”
Blankfein 
 last month that while the was “still thinking” about bitcoin, people were once skeptical of paper money as well.
“I’ve learned over the years that there’s a lot of things that workout pretty well that I don’t love,” he said today. Bitcoin certainly has been doing well in 2017, rising more than 600 percent since the start of the year and surpassing $7,000 for the first time.
And the Goldman Sachs CEO isn’t the only one pulling a Hamlet act over bitcoin. What was once dismissed by Wall Street as a speculative bubble has been suddenly coming up more frequently, both in positive and negative tones. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon 
 that he would fire any trader who began trading bitcoin.
“I don’t have an investment in it, but I’m not willing to pooh-pooh it and that’s why I say I’m open to it,” Blankfein said.

=== Title: Bentley Flying Spur or Rolls-Royce Ghost: Which Fantasy Car Is for You? - Bloomberg ===

Everyone likes a matchup. Senna vs. Prost. Pacquiao vs. Mayweather. Federer vs. Nadal. Heck, even Jay Z vs. Kanye. (Oh boy.)
I can’t afford a Bentley. But when I test drove the 2017 Flying Spur recently in upstate New York, I found myself deliberating whether I’d rather own that or its closest equivalent competitor, the Rolls-Royce Ghost. Which all-star rides higher in the sky? (Spoiler alert: Can’t afford a Rolls, either. No one ever went to journalism school to get rich.)
Here’s why this is an interesting question, for aspirational fans and owners alike. First, these cars are the absolute top of the line in their category. They are astronomically expensive, sure, but not in one another’s context. So which brand is operating best at this level?
And second, some people are actually making this choice. Where many who drive a McLaren will also own other superfast things from Porsche, Aston Martin, or Ferrari, when it comes to Bentley vs. Rolls, you’re generally one or the other. It’s similar to the way that you’re either a Ford house or a GM house, but on the other end of the spending spectrum.
I’ve driven every Rolls on the market today, plus 
 from decades ago. For performance and looks, the cars more than live up to their status as the most regal automotive brand in the world. On the other hand, the (less elegantly named) Flying Spur is a phenomenal driving sedan, plush inside like a British club room and on the outside a little less square than the Rolls—which is either a positive or a negative attribute, depending on who’s doing the looking.
All right, so how do they compare?
Let’s start with the basics. These are each the midsize four-door sedans in their respective brand’s range. (For Bentley, the Muslanne is the bigger sedan; for Rolls, it’s the Phantom.)
For the $244,600 Flying Spur, Bentley has continued its special W12 S engine line with a 626bhp machine that gets 605 pound-feet of torque. (This power is a boost from the 616hp and 590 lb.-ft. of the W12 model.) The sound of it is divine—it starts with a low rumble that fades into a disciplined British throat-clear as you move through the gears. Or you can choose the $205,000 Flying Spur V8 S edition, with 521hp and 502 pound-feet of torque and equally smooth in character. They each have a flawless eight-speed transmission—placid as a country pond at five a.m., unmoved as yet by wind.
Rolls doesn’t make a V8 option on its Ghost. The feeling is that it would dilute the brand and the associated prestige of having a dozen massive cylinders underneath each hood. That may be right. But when it comes to comparing the base versions of each, for sheer engine options, capability and efficiency, Bentley, to my mind, manages to win the advantage.
These numbers on the W12 Bentley are impressive because the $310,650 Ghost has an excellent 12-cylinder BMW Group-made engine but reaches a lesser 563hp and 575 pound-feet of torque. The W12 S Bentley gets 12mpg in the city and 20 in the highway; the V8 S version hits 14mpg in the city and 24mpg on the highway. The Ghost rather splits the difference, with 13mpg in the city and 20 mpg on the highway. Again, these are small differences, but in this rarified echelon it’s the smallest details that separate the excellent from the astounding.
Engine variants are most important, of course, because they translate into how each car feels when you drive it. Where the Bentley muscles you into gear and then glides like an ocean liner, the Rolls feels higher, more like riding atop a sleigh.
The steering in Ghost is lighter, looser, and more elegant than in the Flying Spur, too, which offered supreme, 
 precision and surprising (for a sedan) dynamism as I drove up New York’s 9A toward Stone Ridge and the boutique hotel 
 two hours north of Manhattan.
Bentley’s W12 hits 60mph in 4.2 seconds; Rolls’s V12 hits 60mph in 4.8 seconds. Top speed is 202mph (Bentley) vs. 155mph (Rolls), which is a stark contrast indeed. Even the Bentley V8 S I mentioned earlier beats the V12 Rolls. It has a 60mph sprint time of 4.6 seconds and a top speed of 190mph.
The lesson here is that Bentley’s success at channeling its “Bentley Boy” racing dominance from decades ago is evident even in this four-door, 5,456-pound sedan. If you drive each of these cars, you’ll see it’s more about comparing Bentley’s power position against Rolls’ elegant refinement: This isn’t an argument about which is better—it’s more about what you want.
In fact, while moving in a straight line is no problem for most hulking pieces of metal, it’s shocking that the Flying Spur can change lanes and navigate curves with this kind of finesse. It is a big car. But when you look at the numbers, it makes sense: The Bentley Flying Spur is shorter (208 inches), lighter, and wider (78.1 inches) than the Rolls Ghost (212 inches long, 5,490 pounds, 76.7 inches wide). It’s closer to the ground both in its physical stance and in its driving character, gripping the asphalt in a vice. The Rolls, on the other hand, feels like you’re gliding along a monorail.
Inside, the comparison is virtually a draw. Each comes with two rear seats (or three, if you so choose—but I wouldn’t) spaced far apart enough to accommodate such accouterments as automatic fold-down polished wooden writing tables, television screens, ventilated reclining chairs, champagne coolers, privacy shades, and trunks large enough to fit luggage that’ll hold you over for a week. Yes, they both offer these.
Both the Flying Spur and the Ghost offer supreme conveniences inside—this is not new. In general, Flying Spur is slightly more minimal, while Ghost feels opulent, with more knobs on the dash and controls throughout, plus plush leather pillows with your initials embroidered on them. Ghost’s inch-thick floor mats are a wonder; the heavy-duty long umbrellas in the doors are a treat most consumers would love to be able to flaunt. Bentley doesn’t have them.
New this year for Flying Spur are a unique "SportPlus" steering wheel and engine-spun aluminum trim inside, knurled and carbon fiber detailing, and optional two-tone seats with a contrasting roof ceiling. As in the Ghost, you can also get contrast stitching and dozens of color combinations on leather hides carefully selected from the best bovines in Europe; you can also choose to have a Wi-Fi hot spot, privacy glass, and Beluga gloss on the side windows, and even an electric sunroof with solar cells, among other things, if you want.
And that’s just for the conventional option list. Both Bentley at its Crewe factory and Rolls at its Goodwood headquarters offer extensive bespoke and one-off capabilities for customers for whom money is no object. When I visited each, I saw special cabinets made for watches, safes, whiskey carts, jewelry boxes, wooden script inserted into the dash, 
, and exterior paint colors (Kermit the Frog green; banana peel yellow) only an eccentric could love. If you have unlimited funds, the only limit to what you can commission is your own imagination and daring. The designers there may tell you that you have to wait a while to get your special project produced—but they will not tell you no.
Here more than elsewhere, looks do matter. Ghost is squarer at the front—emotionally and literally. The hood is longer, angled at the edges, and often (unfortunately) painted in the two-tone mode. Its single headlights are streamlined and minimal, and the grill is tall, with long vertical slats set up underneath the iconic Spirit of Ecstasy lady sculpted above. A 24-karat gold hood ornament and 21-inch silver alloy wheels are optional. As a closet introvert who has driven both cars in some of the best neighborhoods in L.A. and New York, I can tell you that the Rolls creates much more of a scene when you drive it. You’ve got to be ready, emotionally, to handle the attention.
The Flying Spur has a more rounded countenance, with two sets of rounded dark tint bi-xenon headlights with LED beams and a softly rectangular grill struck through the middle by one bar of bright steel. The “flying B” wings on the front lie flat and nearly flush with the hood of the car. The 21-inch, seven-twin-spoke wheels in glossy black are new on the W12S and are handsome.
In the rear, the Bentley roofline slops toward a short trunk (it looks a little slouchy, to my eye). The overriding feel is evenly muscular rather than the statelier Ghost. The lines on the Rolls are bolder, more blunt. I like that. But as with fashion, you’ve got to be able to handle it: Wear the car. Don’t let the car wear you.
This, then, is the determining factor: Do you want a powerful sedan that you can drive with real purpose, even aggressively—one that is the perfect blend from the company that makes Her Majesty the Queen’s State Limousine and the world champion GT3 endurance racer? Choose the Flying Spur. It is more dynamic to drive and more engaging as a red-blooded sedan.
On the other hand, do you want to feel like an emperor in the backseat, with all the pomp and circumstance associated therein? Do you want a light feel at the wheel and an association with the most prestigious car brand in history? Choose the Ghost. Its exquisite craftsmanship inside and regal aura will fill your fondest regent fantasies.
Whichever you choose, you’ll have a good drive (or ride, as is more often the case for all of you back-seat enthusiasts who buy these cars). And you’ll be very lucky.

=== Title: The Man Who Invented Modern Wellness - Bloomberg ===

America’s health-care system may be suffering all sorts of indignities, but the wellness industry is doing just fine. More than half the adults in the U.S. take a dietary supplement, and about 20,000 spas offer uncounted treatments, from colonics to cupping. Wellness has become a 
 to a bruising medical establishment.
Most accounts of the origins of wellness as an idea, a movement, and a marketing effort go back to the 1970s, when Americans took to yoga, meditation, and carob chips. But before Deepak Chopra and Dr. Oz and Goop, there was Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. In 1878 he opened the Battle Creek Sanitarium, the Canyon Ranch of its time, and began promoting his rules for “biologic living,” a near-religion then. He treated executives, celebrities, and presidents at the San, as it was called; his most devoted followers were known as the Battle Freaks. He sold them special foods, unusual treatments, exercise machines, books, and albums. For 60 years, Kellogg—­prescient and kooky—was the most famous doctor in America.
His life’s work was intertwined with that of his younger brother, Will, who helped run the San before starting the Kellogg cereal company. Their dramatic, poignant family saga is well told by medical historian Howard Markel in 
(Pantheon Books, $35). Jealousy, mistrust, and meanness strained their relationship: They sued each other over the cereal company (Will prevailed); took credit separately for shared accomplishments; and, Markel writes, spurred each other on to greater success than they might have otherwise achieved. They were estranged when John died in 1943 at 91. The San couldn’t survive without its charismatic, narcissistic founder, and his contributions to the wellness movement were lost, an omission Markel hopes to correct with this book.
Many personal accounts at the end of the 19th century include bouts of indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, and dyspepsia, and no wonder. Whether they were wealthy or not, Americans overate, consuming huge amounts of animal fat, salt, and sugar. In the backwoods of Michigan, where the Kelloggs grew up, people ate cured pork with salty canned vegetables and sweetened canned fruit for lunch and dinner; at breakfast they consumed ham or bacon and potatoes fried in congealed fat from the night before. The average woman didn’t live past 41, and the average man only made it to 39.
John Kellogg, gregarious, intelligent, and obsessed with cleanliness, eventually made his way to medical school in New York, thanks to support from the Seventh-day Adventist Church. When he returned to Michigan, he took over the church’s small health center and converted it into a secular temple to wellness with a suitably dignified name. (He created the word “sanitarium” from “sanatorium,” a facility for long-term illness.) As Markel writes, he “knew that this institution had to be an attractive, modern, luxurious, worthwhile destination for those wealthy enough to seek such commodities.”
At its peak, the San employed 1,000 people, cared for as many as 10,000 patients a year, and farmed 400 acres of vegetables and fruit. The place had its own dairy, canning, and food manufacturing facilities. Eventually Kellogg added a resort with 20 cottages “reserved for the most wealthy of the worried well.” Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and John D. Rockefeller were regulars. To garner publicity, Kellogg invited Harvey Firestone, J.C. Penney, Alfred du Pont, and the composer John Philip Sousa, among others, for free treatments, prompting some to say that his medical specialty was “diseases of the rich and famous.”
Kellogg’s rules for a biologic life make him sound like Michael Pollan—eat grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables, yogurt, and soy milk. Meat and sugar were forbidden. So was masturbation. Smoking was a death wish, obesity a “definite health hazard.” Kellogg warned of the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle, advocating regular, vigorous exercise, plus massage, enemas, fresh air and sunlight, spirituality, laughter, sleep, and lots of pure water. He came up with an early, less-edible version of peanut butter and a fiber-rich mix of grains he called granola. He sold psyllium as a laxative (hello, Metamucil) and treated Richard Byrd with acidophilus soy milk—a probiotic—after the admiral’s 1929 expedition to the South Pole. Kellogg also made his own very popular exercise albums with a brass band. Cue Richard Simmons.
Kellogg promoted some dubious ideas as well: Food should be chewed down to its atomic level; his patients should have four odor-free bowel movements a day; and women should receive pelvic massages, from him, a treatment whose medical purpose no doctor since has been able to explain. The benefits of electrotherapy exercise beds, vibrating chairs, and mechanical horses now seem a little suspect, too.
Kellogg spent his last years building and running a second sanitarium, outside Miami; he’d left the San after it was forced into receivership during the Depression. Kellogg’s legacy might have been more enduring had he not left his entire estate to his Race Betterment Foundation, which promoted eugenics. And some of his recipes might still be on the market if he hadn’t alienated the brother who could manufacture them. “Many of his sounder concepts of wellness remain sage prescriptions written out millions of times each day,” Markel concludes. Yet when most people hear Kellogg, they think corn flakes.

=== Title: Bitcoin Exchange Gets $100 Million Investment - Bloomberg ===

Coinbase Inc., the digital currency exchange that in the past two months suffered a trading crash and upset customers over how it handled the 
, received a $100 million investment from a group led by IVP.
Spark Capital, Greylock Partners, Battery Ventures, Section 32 and Draper Associates also participated, according to a statement Thursday. Coinbase plans to use the money to expand its engineering and customer support staff, open a New York office for its professional trading platform GDAX and grow Toshi, “a mobile browser for the ethereum network that provides universal access to financial services,” said Megan Hernbroth, a spokeswoman.
Founded in 2012, San Francisco-based Coinbase said it has seen “unprecedented growth” over the last year as it helped customers buy and sell more than $25 billion worth of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether. Cryptocurrencies have seen enormous price gains -- bitcoin is up 250 percent year to date -- trouncing other asset classes amid an explosion of attention, but there are growing pains.
On June 21, ether crashed to 10 cents from $317.81 on Coinbase’s GDAX exchange. The cause was a single $12.5 million trade -- one of the biggest ever -- that triggered further selling. It all happened in 
, after which computer algorithms started buying, driving prices back up to $300 within 10 seconds. “We have reimbursed all customers affected,” Hernbroth said. To help prevent a repeat of the ether crash, Coinbase is considering developing circuit breakers that would pause trading to prevent accidents after consulting with industry experts including the New York Stock Exchange, which has an investment in the company.
Earlier this month, the bitcoin community updated the software it runs to increase the amount of transactions the network can process. In so doing, it created a new digital currency known as bitcoin cash. Initially, Coinbase said it wouldn’t support access to bitcoin cash for its customers, which angered many and led to threats of lawsuits, 
 Fortune magazine. Coinbase has subsequently said it would allow customers to access their bitcoin cash by Jan. 1.
Hernbroth said they’ll hit the Jan. 1 deadline “assuming no additional risks emerge.”

=== Title: One of the Biggest Bitcoin Bulls on Wall Street Just Turned Cautious - Bloomberg ===

Fundstrat Global Advisors head of research Thomas J. Lee, who 
 for bitcoin to hit $6,000 by the middle of 2018 and $25,000 by 2022, has turned cautious after the recent rally "on contemporaneous fundamentals."
Lee says the roughly 60 percent surge in the past month to more than $7,000 is a result of multiple factors, including the CME Group Inc.’s plan to offer futures and speculation Amazon.com Inc. is acquiring crypto-related domain names.
He recommends buying bitcoin in the $5,500 range and the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) at $750, and is “long-term constructive” on bitcoin, maintaining his 2022 price target of $25,000.

=== Title: The Hottest New Way of Investing in Silicon Valley Comes With a Big Catch - Bloomberg ===

It’s too late to invest in Airbnb Inc. but a company that bills itself as the Airbnb of cloud computer storage is raising cash -- and anyone with an Internet connection can get in on the action.
Storj Labs Inc. is selling digital coins at 50 cents apiece to raise $30 million in an early stage financing round. In just five days, hundreds of contributors signed up for a piece of what they hope will be the next Silicon Valley unicorn. But there’s a catch -- unlike traditional venture capital investments, the tokens don’t confer a claim on Storj’s equity or future profits.
Instead, the tokens’ value derives from their utility in the firm’s app, by providing access to data storage on a distributed network. They are the latest entry in the growing ledger of 
, digital coins that unlock myriad apps across the computing world. The coins are tradable on dozens of online 
 and demand for all sorts of them has exploded as people speculate on the next big tech startup.
“The average investor is missing out on the Ubers and AirBnbs of the world,” said Bart Stephens, a managing partner at Blockchain Capital, a VC firm that’s invested in blockchain-related startups since 2012. “If the next Uber decides to issue tokens, that would be an opportunity for more investors to get access to the most exciting technologies out there.”
The Storj sale is known as an initial coin offering, a model of finance spreading across the tech sector. Investors spent $332 million on tokens in the past year, more than double what VCs handed over in seed rounds, according to data compiled by coin-focused 
 The Control. The haul is slated to hit $600 million in 2017, it says, adding to a market for tokens that’s nearly tripled in the past year.
ICOs are possible thanks to blockchain, the catchall term for a digital ledger that promises incorruptible storage of financial transactions. Banks and stock exchanges have spent 
 on it, looking for ways to cut the costs for transferring money or recording equity sales. One of the latest to 
 the technology was the chief executive officer of Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson. Most famously, it’s the technology that underpins bitcoin -- just as it does for every token offered in an ICO.
Their massive increase in popularity has more than a few detractors warning of a bubble, worried that the allure of finding the next tech lottery ticket is fueling rampant 
. The concern is particularly acute at a time when investors are fretting about stretched valuations for tech startups, with the likes of Uber commanding multibillion-dollar price tags even as they burn through cash.
Take 
, a prediction market application based on the Ethereum blockchain that raised $12.5 million in 12 minutes on April 24, resulting in a market cap of almost $300 million. It’s generated no revenue and has little more than a white paper describing what it intends to do. Yet its tokens, which would allow users to bet on things such as election outcomes, soared eightfold in the three weeks since May 2, giving it a valuation of over $2 billion -- more than the average Russell 2000 Index stock.
Gnosis’s runup is just part of the craze that’s gripped the cryptocurrency market in the last month, with the price of a bitcoin surging over 30 percent in the past week alone to more than $2,500. That’s pushed the market capitalization of digital currencies over 50 percent higher to more than $90 billion.
Even after that surge, the market is still relatively small, though it’s taking steps toward maturity as the ICO boom spreads. There are platforms to 
 historical prices and volume, and 
 on individual issuances to help prospective buyers assess a firm’s prospects.
The offerings happen outside the purview of regulators -- quite by design -- as technically, the coins are part of the app and not securities. ICOs don’t have disclosure requirements, and the issuer can accept an unlimited number of U.S. investors, instead of the 99 vetted investors limited to traditional VC funding rounds.
The space has also been a breeding ground for scams, and some coins have turned out to be vulnerable to attacks. 
 were able to steal $50 million from a fund called Decentralized Autonomous Organization after it raised $150 million in the biggest issuance ever in April 2016.
For entrepreneurs, the appeal is obvious. A white paper published online replaces weeks of pitches to VC firms, followed by an online auction that can take minutes. The technology can be poked and prodded by geeks around the world, providing a depth of expertise often missing at even the best Silicon Valley firms.
“You don’t have to limit yourself,” said Jae Kwon, who raised $16.8 million in a coin sale for Cosmos, which aims to provide custodian-like service for transactions across different blockchains. “There are just not that many VCs and they’re not experts. People who contributed to our fundraiser are the experts.”

=== Title: Bitcoin Options Will Be Available This Fall - Bloomberg ===

Digital currency investors and miners will be able to hedge the volatile assets under U.S. regulatory oversight for the first time in just a couple of months.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission granted LedgerX LLC, a cryptocurrency trading platform operator, registration as a clearing house for derivatives contracts settling in digital currencies, according to a 
 by the regulators Monday. With the approval, LedgerX is set to become the first federally regulated digital currency options exchange and clearinghouse in the U.S. as interest and volatility in the method of exchange surges.
“It’s an important milestone for the digital currency market broadly,” said Paul Chou, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader, who is LedgerX’s chief executive. “This will pave the way for others globally to look at the space and the appropriate way to regulate a new market like this.”
The New York-based company plans to offer one to six month bitcoin-to-dollars options contracts in late September to early October, Chou said in a telephone interview. Contracts for other digital currencies including for Ethereum’s ether are expected to follow, as well as longer-term protection.
The CFTC had granted LedgerX 
 digital currencies earlier this month. The company, which is backed by Alphabet Inc.’s venture-capital arm, aims to provide institutional investors the ability to hedge against price swings in digital currencies in the same way they protect against volatility in other assets.
Other platforms that offer options trading are Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange, owned by Seychelles-incorporated HDR Global Trading Ltd., and Deribit of Amsterdam. In 2015, the CFTC ordered bitcoin options trading platform Derivabit, which was based in California, to cease operations as it hadn’t followed regulatory procedures.
This is another step in the crypto-currency community’s efforts for the sector to mature and draw in a broader user and investor base. Bitcoin had been under pressure as feuding factions disagreed on how to help the digital asset scale, until prices rebounded last week on signs an agreement is near.
Chou said the ability to hedge digital assets will attract institutional investors who had been on the sidelines.
“We’re getting people that want to hedge and people that want exposure to a new asset class that they can add to their portfolio and help diversify, and get potential upside of potential digital currency,” Chou said. “We want to keep it to a certain size in the beginning before we scale up over the next couple of months.”

=== Title: Digital Coins Are So Hot They’re Selling Them Like an IPO - Bloomberg ===

David Vorick, 24, is one of those techies with a plan to change the world. His startup runs a data storage service called Sia, similar to those of 
 and 
 The difference is that Sia is totally decentralized. People who need a digital file cabinet are matched up with hosts with extra storage capacity in an online marketplace that runs on blockchain, the same technology that supports the virtual currency bitcoin. To Vorick, this isn’t just a nifty technical accomplishment but an idealistic challenge to the power of the internet’s oligarchs. “We are really passionate about making this network that is fully independent of anybody who can step in and say, ‘You’re not allowed to use it anymore,’ ” Vorick said last month at a conference in New York.
For finance types there’s something else interesting about Sia. To buy storage space—or get paid for it—you need to use the system’s own digital tokens, called Siacoin. And on sites where people trade virtual currencies, Siacoin has surged more than 1,200 percent in U.S. dollar value since May 1. The total value of this startup money was about $400 million on June 13. Other digital coins have also gone through the roof. XRP, the token for a global payment system called Ripple, has increased almost 4,000 percent in the past three months, giving it a market value of about $10 billion.
Blockchain businesses don’t always sell their tokens—they may be generated by the system itself. But more and more startups are offering tokens as a way to raise money upfront in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), a nod to traditional initial public offerings of securities. So far this year, 63 sales have raised $521 million, according to blockchain research firm Smith + Crown. That has already far surpassed the $260 million raised in 2016, says Emma Channing, general counsel at Argon Group, a year-old digital finance investment bank in Los Angeles. Channing expects well over $1 billion in token sales this year.
That’s $1 billion for ... what, exactly? Keeping explanations as simple as possible, blockchain is a way to record transactions and contracts in an online ledger. The ledger isn’t maintained by one controlling system or owner but by an expanding network of computers across the internet. Blockchains can record every time a digital coin, such as a bitcoin, is traded, but they can also keep track of increasingly more complex interactions, ­creating new ways to run everything from insurance to social networks.
Some kind of tradable token is increasingly integral to how these new blockchain businesses work. Take the Basic Attention Token (BAT), created by 
, which is attempting to create a better model for online advertising and publishing. BAT is meant for use on the Brave web browser. Brave gives users more control over the advertising they see and lets them get paid for looking at ads. If users like a site, they will be able to reward the publisher using BATs. The tokens could also be used for digital purchases within Brave, such as photos or games. Brave announced an ICO in March, including a detailed explanation of how the system will work, and scored $35 million in less than a minute when the ICO opened—and finished very quickly—on May 31.
This kind of fundraising has some obvious appeal for a startup: No more going to a venture capital firm that will take a big chunk of ownership and dictate how you do things. Right now, an ICO looks relatively easy. “It seems as if there’s this enormous financial pressure of money that wants to move into this space, but there’s really limited places for it to go,” says Brian Lio, chief executive officer of Smith + Crown. But an offering that sells out in seconds may work against some of the bigger goals of a blockchain enterprise. Tokens are supposed to be used by customers. “If your token instantaneously sells out to a few institutional investors, you’re missing a big point of tokens, which is to get them to users and build a community,” says Lio.
Some of the money sloshing into new coins may be recycled gains from older digital currencies, particularly bitcoin and another called ether. The price of bitcoin has tripled since the beginning of the year, and ether has jumped more than 4,000 percent. Some early investors—“crypto­currency whales,” Channing calls them—have built up a huge store of virtual wealth. Alex Sunnarborg, a research analyst at CoinDesk, estimates that about three-quarters of the money going into ICOs comes from within the crypto-economy.
Which may (sort of) explain LGD, the digital token for the Legends Room, which describes itself as “a world class Las Vegas gentlemen’s cabaret ­r­­e-imagined using blockchain technology,” according to the website. It sold about $1 million in LGD in an ICO that closed in May, says Peter Klamka, a consultant who set up the token strategy for the business. For all those with crypto­currency burning holes in their pockets, it’s one way to answer such questions as, “How do you spend it, and what do you get for it? How do you enjoy it?” Klamka says. “You get more than just another ­crypto-asset to sit there and look at on your screen—the first real-world opportunity to actually put your arms around something.” Tokens can be used for discounts on drinks and access to a members-only room and events featuring stars of mixed martial arts. The club is set to open in July.
At Token Summit, the conference where Vorick spoke, the atmosphere verged on breathless—slide decks prepared 10 days earlier were already out of date. Still, there was skepticism about the onslaught of the investor class, including from one professional investor. “It’s really awesome to have things be instantly funded and financialized, but I think the investors should be brighter about it,” Richard Craib, founder of the hedge fund Numerai, told the audience. Numerai has a digital coin but didn’t do an ICO. It gave the token to some 16,000 data scientists who model predictions that the company uses to make investments. If a model performs well, meaning real-world gains for Numerai, the scientists who built it get more of the tokens and can exchange them eventually for dollars. Those whose predictions fail lose their tokens.
Argon’s Channing spends a lot of her time beating the drum about regulation. ICOs may seem to fall into a legal gray area, but she says the vast majority of tokens count as securities, and if they are sold to investors in the U.S., they fall under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. A legal standard called the Howey Test defines an investment contract as a security if you are putting money into a common enterprise with an expectation of profit, primarily from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. The SEC has yet to wade in, but the hotter the ICO market, the greater the potential for abuse or investor losses that could spur the agency to act. Channing suspects the regulators are waiting for the right case. Meeting requirements for a securities sale will mean selling ICOs to accredited investors with a certain level of sophistication and assets.
The eye-popping gains on coins are drawing more attention to them, a classic precondition of a bubble. Lio says there will certainly be corrections to come, though the potential of the technology is real. Along with Siacoin’s higher value, Sia has seen a jump in users. But why the sudden price spike? “I can only speculate,” Vorick told the Token Summit crowd. “The price rise didn’t really correspond to any major announcement that we made.”

=== Title: As Bitcoin Risks Big Split, Along Comes Minor One: QuickTake Q&A - Bloomberg ===

 has become so successful that the way it operates needs upgrading, and fast. Trouble is, there are opposing views on how to do that and no all-powerful administrative body to determine which method to adopt. After all, part of bitcoin’s allure is its lack of central oversight. The arguments between the different camps transcend the purely technical to encompass philosophy and politics, raising the prospect of the cryptocurrency splitting into two or more versions. That scenario came close to reality in July before a compromise was reached. Another serious test awaits in November but in the meantime there’s been an unexpected development: a minor split.
It was built with security more in mind than the kind of volume its success has brought. To prevent counterfeiting, bitcoin transactions are verified by so-called bitcoin miners in batches called blocks. The blocks are then strung together to form the decentralized open ledger known as the blockchain that’s one of the currency’s biggest selling points. Worries about cyberattacks led the system’s designers to cap the size of blocks at 1 megabyte. But as bitcoin grew in popularity over the past nine years, transaction times and processing fees soared to record levels.
The average time to confirm a bitcoin deal ballooned to six hours at one point this year from under 20 minutes, according to 
. The 
 of transactions rose to a record, 
 as bitcoin holders offered miners increasing amounts to deal with their transactions sooner. In recent weeks, the congestion (and fees) have lightened significantly as some users have steered clear of the traffic jam.
As bitcoin is open-source software, anyone can tweak it as they see fit. That’s allowed various factions to propose different solutions, with most opinions falling in two main schools of thought. First are the bitcoin miners, the thousands of individuals who form a vital part of the blockchain process by deploying their expensive, powerful computers to verify transactions. They support increasing the number of bitcoin transactions in each block. Second are the so-called Core developers who have been instrumental in constructing bitcoin’s bug-proof system. Their proposal: Allow some data to be moved outside the main network, in effect creating multiple ledgers called sidechains. If the two camps follow their own proposals and reject a compromise, two versions of bitcoin’s blockchain would probably come into existence -- effectively splitting the cryptocurrency.
Correct. In late July, a small group of miners -- in a move unrelated to the main debate -- began backing an offshoot with block sizes of 8 megabytes. It’s called 
. On Aug. 1, they successfully deployed their version of bitcoin’s software, triggering the split. The price of bitcoin hardly moved, perhaps because Bitcoin Cash has little support from miners. Even so, its market value soared to $7.3 billion the next day, one-sixth of bitcoin’s.
In July, the broader community compromised with a proposal called 
-- a combination of the Core developers’ suggestion (called 
, for Segregated Witness) and the miners’ proposal. The first step of SegWit2x has been locked in and bitcoin’s network will probably adopt SegWit technology at some point in August. Then, in November, bitcoin will face its next big challenge when some of the world’s biggest miners move to adopt phase two, the doubling of the size of the block. That could lead to bitter disagreements. Opponents among the developers argue that increasing block sizes will leave too much power in too few hands, since the technology required will get more expensive. Miners fear that moving some of bitcoin’s workings off the main network will diminish their importance.
Indeed. Greater volatility would probably ensue as more members of the community are likely to take part in casting a vote for one currency or another. One side effect of the relatively peaceful split by Bitcoin Cash: Others may be encouraged to create more versions of bitcoin, splintering it further.
Miners and Core developers need each other to function, survive -- and prosper. Research analyst Ronnie Moas sees bitcoin’s scarcity and acceptance by investors doubling its value to $5,000 
then surging to as much as $50,000 in the next decade. Miners are paid in new bitcoin. Then there’s the nine years of blood, sweat and tears, not to mention investment, that’s made bitcoin the world’s preeminent cryptocurrency. So far it’s been enough to counter the competing ideologies of what bitcoin should be.
Created in 2009 by a person or a group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin initially attracted an array of figures including libertarians who wished to counter the control of sovereign regulators and central banks. One attraction is that, in contrast to limitless printed currencies, there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins. And as bitcoin’s market value has surged to $45 billion, the debate has intensified over whether it should embrace more mainstream capitalism or fortify its position as a libertarian beacon. More practically, the debate has revolved around whether bitcoin should become like gold and other assets that store value or develop as a payment system and platform for economic activity.

=== Title: Bitcoin Crashes Again After China Moves to Halt Exchange - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin tumbled, heading for its worst week since January 2015, after people familiar with the matter said China aims to stop exchange trading of cryptocurrencies by the end of September.
Regional Chinese regulators were notified of the timeline by a central bank-led group overseeing Internet finance risks, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information is private. Bitcoin dropped 9.3 percent to $3,077.55 at 9:22 a.m. in London, extending this week’s decline to 28 percent.
The notice suggests Chinese policy makers will move quickly on a previously 
 plan to end exchange trading, their most far-reaching measure to rein in the growth of cryptocurrencies. China’s crackdown, which includes a ban on initial coin offerings announced last week, has fueled an abrupt reversal in bitcoin after the digital currency soared more than 700 percent in the 12 months through August.
The digital currency tumbled on Thursday after BTC China, one of the country’s largest cryptocurrency venues, said it would stop handling trades by month-end. Rivals OKCoin and Huobi said they haven’t received any regulatory orders to halt. The People’s Bank of China didn’t immediately reply to a faxed request for comment.
The cryptocurrency ban will only apply to trading on exchanges, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on 
. Authorities don’t have plans to stop over-the-counter transactions, the people said.
While Beijing’s motivation for the exchange ban is unclear, it comes amid a broad clampdown on financial risk in the run-up to a Communist Party leadership reshuffle next month. Bitcoin’s surge over the past few years has fueled concerns of a bubble and prompted warnings of a potential crash from skeptics including JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon and billionaire investor Howard Marks.
China accounts for about 23 percent of bitcoin trades and is also home to many of the world’s biggest bitcoin miners, who use vast amounts of computing power to confirm transactions in the digital currency.
Some market observers have speculated that Chinese regulators will allow cryptocurrency exchanges to re-open once the government has measures in place to provide greater oversight.
Matt Roszak, the chairman of Washington-based Chamber of Digital Commerce and an investor in BTC China, said he anticipates that the exchange will resume operations by year-end.
“That is the expectation based on months of discussions -- the timing of which may be impacted a bit with the ICO phenomenon,” Roszak said in an email. “China is preparing to provide licensure for less than a handful of exchanges as it grapples with the meteoric increase in cryptocurrency trading, and speculation on ICOs -- licensure and engagement with government will help propel this industry forward.”
Predictions for an eventual resumption haven’t done much to comfort bitcoin traders. The cryptocurrency swung to a loss after Bloomberg reported the government notice and is now trading at the weakest level in six weeks.

=== Title: Cyberattack on Medical Software Shows Industry Vulnerability - Bloomberg ===

Many doctors still can’t use a transcription service made by 
 three weeks after the company was hit by a powerful, debilitating computer attack.
Hospital systems including Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said eScription, a Nuance staple product that allows physicians to dictate notes from a telephone, still isn’t functioning. The outage obliterated doctors’ instructions to patients, forcing some to revert to pen and paper.
The computer virus, called Petya, has sent ripples through health care, among the last industries to make the switch to digital record keeping and one of the most frequently targeted by hackers, said Michael Ebert, a partner with KPMG who advises health and life-science companies on cybersecurity.
“Health care has been late to respond to the need for protected information, and the information is worth more,” Ebert said. “It’s amazing how far behind we are, and we know we have to do something.”
Hackers increasingly use viruses to encrypt companies’ information systems, unlocking the data only when a ransom is paid. After the Petya attack began in late June, companies from Oreo-maker Mondelez International Inc. to Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc warned of a blow to their sales. Information systems used by FedEx Corp.’s TNT unit may never fully recover, the shipping company said Monday.
Nuance shares fell 4 percent on Thursday, the most since Aug. 9, 2016, to close at $16.85. They’ve dropped almost 8 percent since June 27, when the attack began.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a system of 25 hospitals and 3,600 doctors, said that its dictation and transcription services are still affected “with no estimated time of resolution.” The nonprofit is using features of medical records systems made by Cerner Corp. and closely held Epic Systems in the interim, said Ed McCallister, the Pittsburgh system’s chief information officer.
When the hack hit in June, the virus spread quickly. Ebert said one of his clients stood in a parking lot with a bullhorn, pleading with employees not to turn on computers, lest the virus spread into them. Another saw 100 workstations infected in an hour. Others shut down their entire systems, painstakingly starting computers one by one offline to see whether they had been tainted.
After acknowledging June 28 that portions of its network were affected, Nuance, based in Burlington, Massachusetts, is still picking up the pieces. In addition to transcription, Nuance named about 10 other affected products, including those used for radiology, billing and software that tracks quality of care.
About half of the company’s $1.95 billion in revenue came from its health-care and dictation business last year. The malware attack represents a big risk for Nuance, as many of its customers use products that appear to have been affected, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh.
“Any time there is a cyberattack and a company is exposed to that threat, that presents both reputational risk as well as the risk from disruption,” he said. “Since a lot of the deals get signed toward the end of the quarter, the timing of it could have impacted certain deal closures.”
Nuance said it has been fixing affected systems, enhancing security and bringing customers back online. The company declined to say how many clients were affected by the attack.
“We are doing everything within our power to support our health-care customers and provide them with the information and resources they need to provide quality patient care, including offering an alternative system and solutions,” company spokesman Richard Mack said Wednesday in an email. “We have no indication that any customer information has been lost or removed from the network.”
The loss of service is an invitation to customers to seek other products and vendors, such MModal, a Nuance rival. Even though Intermountain Health Care, a Salt Lake City-based company that operates 22 hospitals, wasn’t affected, it turned off all its Nuance products and is using other transcription tools, said Daron Cowley, a spokesman.
At Beth Israel Deaconess, a Harvard-affiliated hospital, doctors who have been accustomed to using Nuance’s telephone-based product are switching to its Dragon system, where physicians dictate into a computer, making edits as they go.
That still means lost revenue for Nuance. While the computer-based product is a single software purchase, Nuance bills for eScription by line of text. So far, it’s been three weeks of revenue they can’t get back, and more users may drop away, said John Halamka, Beth Israel’s chief information officer.
“The hardest thing for a clinician is a change in workflow,” he said. “If you’ve changed for a couple of weeks, you might not go back.”
Nuance has done well to try to maintain customers in the aftermath of the attack, KPMG’s Ebert said, but the damage has already been done.
“They’re probably going to have a bad quarter,” he said.

=== Title: Global Cyber Attack Could Cost $121.4 Billion, Lloyd's Estimates - Bloomberg ===

A global cyber attack could result in damages of as much as $121.4 billion in an extreme event, comparable to economic losses caused by 
 in 2005, 
 said in a report.
Average losses from a scenario where an attack would cause a widely-used cloud-service provider to fail would be $53 billion, depending on organizations involved and the length of the data storage disruption, Lloyd’s said in the

Prominent hacker attacks such as WannaCry in May and Petya in June have raised awareness of the vulnerability some companies have to cyber crime and insurers 
 by offering coverage for such attacks. The global cyber-insurance market is worth between $3 billion and $3.5 billion, Lloyd’s estimates. It could rise to between $8.5 billion and $10 billion by 2020,

The second scenario used in the Lloyd’s report, where vulnerability in a widely used software was exploited by hackers, could result in losses of $9.7 billion for a large event and $28.7 billion for an extreme event. Insurers would only cover $762 million to $2.1 billion of the cost, the document said.

=== Title: Bitcoin Proxy Stocks Surge in Cryptocurrency Feeding Frenzy - Bloomberg ===

Investors can’t seem to get enough of all things crypto.
A day after the successful start of bitcoin futures trading, companies often seen as a safer alternative to investing directly in the cryptocurrency are on a tear. Riot Blockchain Inc. surged 33 percent and the Bitcoin Investment Trust climbed 15 percent. Overstock.com Inc. and MGT Capital Investments Inc. also advanced.
The rallies follow a widespread selloff in the same equities in the run-up to the debut of bitcoin futures that investors speculated would reduce demand for proxies. So far, that hasn’t materialized, as Cboe World Markets Inc.’s successful start of the derivatives contracts has only heightened interest in virtually all crypto assets.

“Our portal is down and we are not able to take on new orders until we get it back up,” Maersk Line Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Clerc said by phone, declining to say when systems would return to normal. “We’re being very cautious to ensure that as we bring the applications back up, the attack is contained and rolled back. It limits the accessibility we have at the moment.”
Maersk’s 
 unit, which operates 76 port and terminal facilities in 59 countries around the globe, is impacted at a number of sites, including the Port of New York and New Jersey, the largest port on the U.S. East Coast, and Rotterdam in The Netherlands, Europe’s largest harbor.
A terminal operated by Maersk at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, a facility near Mumbai which is India’s biggest container port, was unable to load or unload because of the attack. With the Gateway Terminal India facility unable to identify which shipment belongs to whom, the port is clearing cargo manually, Chairman Anil Diggikar said in a phone interview.
Maersk’s energy units, which include North Sea producer Maersk Oil, aren’t operationally affected.
The attack, similar to the WannaCry virus, has now reached Asia after spreading from Europe to the U.S. overnight, hitting businesses, port operators and government systems. Hackers are telling the victims to pay $300 in cryptocurrency per infected computer to unlock their systems.
Customers with goods in transit should expect delays, Clerc said.
“There will be some level of impact on the orders we are in the process of transporting right now,” he said. “I don’t think this is of a magnitude that it impacts global trade. It will impact what we do.”
Maersk’s container line transports about 15 percent of the world’s seaborne manufactured trade. The attack comes at a time when Maersk has rolled out a new digitization strategy to modernize an industry where most bookings still take place by telephone.
Clerc said the company hasn’t paid any ransom money to the hackers.
“What we understand is that the channels the hackers have chosen for ransom money has been shut down by governments, so that is contained now,” he said.

=== Title: How Ransomware Works: QuickTake Q&A - Bloomberg ===

An increasingly popular and disruptive form of cybercrime is 
 which makes files and data stored on computers inaccessible unless a fee is paid. Once a niche area for hackers, the attacks are now affecting government agencies and some of the world’s biggest corporations. Companies hit in 2017 included 
, FedEx Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft and advertising giant WPP Plc. The U.K. National Health Service and a number of Ukrainian agencies were also harmed. With sophisticated ransomware software available online for hackers to use and the rise of anonymous digital currencies such as 
, there are fears the attacks will only continue.
It’s a form of malicious software, “
” for short, that essentially holds a device hostage until a fee is paid to restore it to normal. In the case of the WannaCry worm in May, the ransom was $300 in bitcoin, payable within 72 hours. In June, a South Korean web hosting company agreed to 
 more than $1 million to unlock its servers, the largest known payout. The virus spreads from machine to machine on a network, often via email attachments from rogue senders. The targets are usually older computer operating systems that have not been properly maintained with up-to-date security software.
Typically one of two things: Either you restore your files from a backup, or you lose them forever. Hackers often give victims a deadline -- say 72 hours to pay the $300 in bitcoin; after that, the price doubles. If the targets refuse to pay, their computers will be permanently locked -- a serious problem for people who haven’t backed up their data.
The identity of the hackers is hard to learn because they can act anonymously online and the ransom is paid with digital currencies. But the most recent forms of ransomware used a technique 
 from the U.S. 
, and affected computers running on older versions of Microsoft Corp.’s operating system.
The simple answer is that it’s expensive to keep operating systems with the best security up to date. Microsoft issued a 
 in March that it labeled “critical,” but many users of personal computers either couldn’t or didn’t download it. Machines still running the long-outdated Windows XP are even more at risk, since Microsoft ended support for that several years ago. An organization with hundreds or thousands of computers would need to spend a lot of money to upgrade all of their systems. When budgets are limited and no problems are occurring, performing costly upgrades is often considered a lower priority. Another reason is software compatibility. Many companies use bespoke software that was designed many years ago and which is incompatible with modern computer operating systems. Keeping hold of those old, vulnerable systems may be preferable than rewriting or upgrading.
Hackers make the ransom small enough that companies may conclude it’s cheaper to pay it than to hire expensive specialist teams to restore their data. The low cost, combined with the threat of doubling after three days, may have felt to the perpetrators like the most practical way to get paid.
You can 
 via a broker or specialist exchange. There are many available online for use with numerous currencies. Once the money has been verified and transferred from a bank to the exchange, the user is granted a bitcoin or fraction of a bitcoin in a digital wallet, which can then be sent anonymously to any other registered wallet.
Maybe. Some government agencies perform forensics on bitcoin purchases to try to learn more about the perpetrators. But the tools aren’t likely to lead to a particular person or group unless the money is touched or withdrawn. Some experts believe withdrawal might not happen, since the world’s cyber-intelligence forces will be watching the bitcoin account for any sign of activity. The perpetrators may choose to leave the money and count their losses, but remain anonymous. It’s perhaps more likely that clues within the malware itself will provide more intelligence on the identities or location of the attackers.
Yes. And experts believe it will. It’s not difficult for an attacker to alter the code of this malware in order to deploy it once more, although the threat of such action may motivate companies and individuals to protect themselves better, thereby reducing the potential damage, and appeal, of a repeat attack. The advice of some security specialists is simple: Don’t pay the ransom -- it just encourages copycats.
The most effective form of prevention -- for businesses or individuals -- is to back up files. If data is backed up regularly to an external source, a computer can be reset to its factory settings and then the backed-up files can be reinstalled, essentially wiping the ransomware from the system. Ransomware worms are easy for hackers to modify so even if a fix is found for one bug it won’t necessarily safeguard against a future attack.
 

=== Title: Buy a Vintage Volvo P1800 for Style and Substance - Bloomberg ===

The world record for most miles driven on a private vehicle owned by only one person belongs to a 1966 Volvo P1800. The little red coupe has run more than 
, farther than traveling to the moon and back six times. It did them all on its original engine.
Certainly, proper maintenance contributed to the car’s longevity, but even the most tender, loving care can’t eke that kind of mileage out of just anything. Volvo P1800 coupes—separate from the later two-door wagon versions—are special.
“They really hit the sweet spot” for vintage collectors, said Hagerty’s Jonathan Klinger, noting that the cars are unusual but not so out of the ordinary that it’s impossible to find spare parts. Also, “they have enough power, combined with relatively good handling for a car from the 60s, that they’re a delight to drive. And they have a unique-enough design that they stand out at your typical car show.”
Even better, one in good condition can be had for well under $20,000. Sure, last year in Scottsdale, Gooding & Co. sold a 1967 P1800 for 
, the highest-ever price paid for a standard P1800 at auction. And in September 2014, Bonhams sold a 1973 1800ES, a late variant of the 1800 line, for 
, the world record sale for any Volvo. Still, you can get proper, restoration-ready examples of the model for as low as 
 and 
.
Or buy one somewhere between needing work and museum-perfect for $30,000 to $50,000, such as 
 1971 Cypress Green P1800 coupe in Europe. If you do, chances are it will hold its value.
Prices of the P1800 coupes made from 1968 to 1972 have risen 52 percent over the last five years, with the current average value for an average-condition example hovering near $13,000. (Values of the Volvo 1800 wagons made from 1972 to 1973, which are the later models of the 1800 line, are up 42 percent over the same time last year, with an average value of $15,000, according to Hagerty data.)
The average sale price at auction this year for a coupe has been $14,000.
“In the past years they have had a nice steady increase, appreciating just slightly ahead of the overall market,” Klinger said. By the same token, this is not an investment for aggressive speculators. “You’re not likely going to see a massive jump in value in the near term,” he added.
Not a jump in financial value, maybe. But you’ll reap heavy dividends when it comes to emotional value. Volvo introduced the 1800 line in 1961 as a way to compete against European (and especially British) automakers in the sports car segment in the U.S. The idea was that it would offer luxury-caliber performance and styling at an affordable price. A series of cheeky advertorials (“It’s sort of a souped-down Ferrari”) bolstered the concept, but it was the car’s mixed-European good looks that proved most compelling.
The 1800 was designed by a young Swede working for the Italian design house Frua, then produced in the U.K. by a British company named Jensen, so it truly combined the best design and manufacturing elements of the time.
A 2+2 coupe, the P1800 featured a long, rectangular front nose, hemmed by two small, round headlights set far apart on either side; a swooping flourish ran along the side body, set high from each headlight and running back toward the rear of the car. Its concave, oblong grille is still much the same as the one you see in the modern S90 and V90 cars. Two small rear fins frame the back. Inside, the dominant attributes were big, round gauges behind the steering wheel and along the dashboard, a thin, three-spoke steering wheel, and flat, square seats. 
The car debuted to general success, but major global acclaim didn’t come until 1962, when Roger Moore drove an eggshell white P1800 (license plate ST1) in the popular television series 
. Per-Ake Froberg, head of the Volvo Cars Heritage program, said Jaguar had passed on the opportunity.
“The show was a real breakthrough,” Froberg said. “The production company had asked Jaguar to provide a car, because they had a dashing new, little car on the market called the E-Type, but Jaguar wasn’t interested or they couldn’t provide one, so someone had seen this new Swedish car in the showroom and asked Volvo. The car became the Saint’s car and helped people all over the world connect with Volvo.”
Early models of the 1800 had little, four-cylinder engines, disc brakes, and a rear-wheel-drive, four-speed manual transmission; later models introduced a four-speed manual with overdrive and even a 3-speed automatic transmission. Power ratings evolved, too, with additional variants, rising from 100-horsepower to more than 120hp as new ones, including a shooting brake, made debuts. Total global production of the 1800 line from 1961 through 1973 hit 47,492 units. Many of them shipped directly to the U.S., which is great for American collectors because it means little difficulty in finding one.
The challenge, rather, will be in finding the right one to love.
“We are not talking about an exotic Italian vehicle, so it is definitely possible to find one,” Froberg said. “But our collectors and clubs are very devoted to them—it is getting more and more impossible to find a really good one."

=== Title: These Companies Stand to Gain the Most From the Cryptocurrency Rush - Bloomberg ===

Mining references generally evoke images of picks and shovels.
For advocates of bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies surging in value, the gold may be in the shares of the companies that produce the computer processors and chips used to create the digital currencies in the process that’s become known as mining.
Digital coins can only be created by using computers to solve complex mathematical problems. The difficulty increases as more of the problems get solved, prompting the miners to require even more powerful hardware. With digital coin prices soaring, demand for the components is surging as miners are able to recoup their initial investment quicker.
A complete mining rig, which is made up of graphics cards, a processor, power supply, memory, cabling and a fan, costs between $2,400 to $3,800 on 
. The Antminer S9, which is 
 to mine 0.29 bitcoin per month, and 
 for $2,795, which means you can break even in about four months with bitcoin at $2,700, without taking into account electricity costs. Miners typically buy complete rigs or build them themselves.
The following are some of the companies that make the parts.
The Santa Clara, California-based company manufactures graphic processing units used by gamers and increasingly, by digital-currency miners. GPUs listed in Nvidia’s website can cost as much as $1,200. The rig-mining market can grow to about $1.3 billion, and with GPUs making up approximately 2/3 of coin mining costs, the demand for GPUs can increase to $875 million, according to a RBC Capital Markets report on June 6. If Nvidia gets half of that, it represents a 10 percent increase on its GPU sales, RBC analyst Mitch Steves said in an interview. The company currently has about 75 percent of the GPU market, according to a Jon Peddie Research 
.
The complexity of mining bitcoin has increased to the point that GPUs aren’t powerful enough, and miners are mostly using application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices don’t make. Tech news website Digitimes 
 Nvidia and AMD are planning to release GPUs specifically designed to mine bitcoin.
Shares of Nvidia have climbed 45 percent this year, and have more then tripled in the past year.
AMD, as the company is known, also makes graphics cards used for mining ethereum and other coins. The Sunyvale, California-based company’s shares have rallied the most in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in the past week, in part thanks to a PCWorld 
 that said it’s almost “impossible” to get AMD’s Radeon graphics cards after a surge in demand from ethereum miners. 
The company also builds the processors typically used to build mining rigs, and its Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster 
 at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference its product compete with bigger rival Intel Corp.
The shares are up 27 percent in the past month, and have almost tripled over 12 months.
Digital currency mining has the potential to boost demand for Intel’s processors, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. While AMD CPUs are popular among miners, Intel is the traditional leader in the sector and is taking 
 to counter its fledgling rival.
The company’s shares have lagged rivals, with a gain of 17 percent in the past year.
Boise, Idaho-based Micron is the largest U.S. maker of memory chips, one of the components of a mining rig, so it also stands to benefit, Cassidy said.
Micron shares have surged almost 50 percent this year, and have more then doubled in the past 12 months.

=== Title: Analyst Tom Lee Says The Bitcoin Investment Trust Could Triple From Here - Bloomberg ===

Thomas J. Lee, one of the most bullish bitcoin advocates on Wall Street, says the lone investment vehicle available to institutional investors is cheap because the market isn’t taking into account the digital coins spawned from 
 in the biggest digital currency.
Shares of the 
 could be worth $2,360 to $2,600 if bitcoin climbs to $25,000 by 2022, Lee, who is head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in a report Wednesday. The trust, which goes by the ticker GBTC, closed Tuesday at $680 in over-the-counter trading, while bitcoin recently touched a record $6,064.
The trust holds bitcoin and is only available to accredited investors.
“GBTC at $688 and with 20% NAV premium is an attractive way to gain exposure to bitcoin,” Lee said in the report, noting that the market has underestimated NAV because it has overlooked the $31 worth of bitcoin cash and $22 of bitcoin gold in each GBTC share.
“What could go wrong?” Lee wrote. “The biggest risk, in our view, is the GBTC, as an ETN, could face a liquidity problem -— if there is an all out panic. But given the highly audited custody of GBTC and its underlying bitcoin holdings, we see this as a short-term issue.”

=== Title: Why You Should Buy a 1960s Chevy Corvair Right Now - Bloomberg ===

Ralph Nader published his auto-safety takedown 
 51 years ago.
Since then, the bestselling book has become synonymous with national crash-protection standards and GM’s uncommonly dangerous (as Nader saw it) Chevrolet Corvair.
The notorious compact car saw two generations of production from 1960 to 1969; it had an air-cooled flat-six engine placed in the rear, rather than under the hood, which made it susceptible to spin-outs, and it lacked a simple roll-bar to protect passengers in the event of a flip. Its single-piece steering column would impale a driver upon impact, Nader said.
But descriptions of its lethal design were overblown. In 1972, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a 134-page 
 clearing the Corvair of Nader’s accusations. (“The 1960–63 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests ... and is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic," it 
.) GM also redesigned the suspension in 1965 
. In recent years, the average prices for Corvairs from any year have reached an 
.
“What Nader did was start an era during which there was more awareness of safety and the manufacturers. The product itself almost became irrelevant at that point,” said Tom Libby, an automotive analyst for IHS. “The book was the major pivot point for the industry.”
It’s difficult to find a group of owners as devoted to their chosen collectible as those who love the Corvair. The cars are in 
, at 
 (they’re 
 the more-popular Impalas), and in 
. 
“Corvair enthusiasts love their cars,” said Jonathan Klinger, a spokesman for Hagerty, a Michigan-based company that insures collectible and vintage cars. “Part of it is probably they have always been in defense mode, having to explain that the car isn't as dangerous to the general public as it is made out to be, because the Corvair is certainly not the death-trap that Mr. Nader was trying to illustrate.”
In fact, Nader’s book contained just one chapter that discussed the Corvair. And numerous vehicles throughout automotive history were similarly configured and potentially dangerous to drive. Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Porsche, and Triumph used similar swing-axel designs in their cars at the time, for instance; if you don’t know what you’re doing, a 1970s-era Porsche 911 Turbo can be extremely unsettling to drive.
“The focus on the Corvair was a way to expose the manufacturers in general about things the public had not been aware of,” Libby said. “If it wasn’t that car, it would have been another.”
And, thanks to the passage of decades of road time, Corvairs are better understood now than they ever have been in the past.
“When they first came out, the service stations didn't know how to work on them, and now after all this time you've got this tremendous dedicated group of Corvair people, and any quirk the car may have is fully understood,” Klinger said. “They are a very easy vehicle to work on. That’s what makes them beautiful and fun to drive.”
Chevy made the first Corvairs as simple, four-door sedans (in 500 and 700 trim levels) with a three-speed manual transmission that came standard. A two-speed automatic was optional. Soon after, two-door coupe versions arrived, plus a 900-series “Monza” edition that had sportier seats and a more athletic, four-speed, manual transmission. By the end of its run, the series included coupe, convertible, sedan, and four-door station wagon body styles, plus even a van and pickup truck variant.
Americans bought them as fun drivers that had a particular style behind the wheel, because of their independent suspension and a rear engine configuration that was unique for an American car. They cost well under $3,000 brand-new. They even earned the nickname “the poor man’s Porsche.”
The Corvairs looked different from anything on the market at the time, too. They didn’t have the pony-muscle curves and powerful V8 engine of the popular Mustang, and they were smaller than the heavy, cruiser sedans that GM and Ford were making otherwise. Plus, the turbo-charged engines in later models and compact bodies made them seem faintly foreign, more like something from Wolfsburg, Germany, than from Motown.
There were valid complaints about the cars: The heating system would sometimes leak noxious fumes into the cabin; the cars would leak oil like sieves; the tires were often overinflated in order to compensate for dicey handling; and the polished metal dashboards would blind drivers when the sun hit them. Those idiosyncrasies have failed to deter modern buyers.
“This is a wonderful road car,” Jay Leno said on his YouTube show about his 
. “A lot of people put down the Corvair, but I consider it one of the 10 best General Motors cars of all time because it was just so different from anything else they built. They really handle. They’re built nicely. They’re a lot of fun.”
I first became aware of the obsession while talking to Brandon Pendleton, a 
 friend who lives in Miami. The guy owns a café racer motorcycle, runs his own music production studio, and rides expensive fixie bicycles. He could afford to own plenty of vintage cars, but the Corvair seeped into his veins before anything else.
Pendleton paid $6,500 for his 1961 900 Monza five years ago. He loved the pristine white exterior and scarlet interior, plus it had only 90,000 original miles when he bought it.
“I don’t drive too fast—it’s just a cruiser,” Pendleton told me. But his care for the car pays off: So far, he’s not had to deal with any big maintenance problems on it.
According to Hagerty, the average price of a mid-level Corvair in satisfactory and drivable condition today is $6,600, with later models of the 500 line averaging 
. 
 in 
 can run to $20,000 or even, very rarely, $30,000.
Values have leveled a bit in recent years, but Klinger doesn’t expect a plunge. The best idea is to buy one, work on it, have fun with it for a year or two, then sell it for as much or a little more than you paid for it. Despite a slight dip in value for earlier models, Corvairs made from 1965 to 1969 have risen nearly 12 percent in value, on average, since 2011. Corvairs from 1968 are up 23.78 percent over the same period, with models from 1966 and 1967 up in value nearly as much.  
More important, now is the time to buy. (I like this red, 102-horsepower 
 with chrome and a new stereo that will go on sale in Mississippi in October.) Car prices are generally higher in the spring, when people are thinking of road trips and summer rallies; early autumn leaves many collectible owners debating whether to pack their vintage babies up for winter or just sell them before the cold comes, in order to avoid the hassle and expense of storage.
“For someone looking for a very reasonably priced collector vehicle a little different than what you typically see, the Corvair is an excellent candidate,” Klinger said. “It's not a vehicle that you would want to buy in hopes of tremendous price appreciation, but it’s a fun, honest, simple collector car. I hope to own one myself some day.”

=== Title: This Is the Most Luxurious Open-Air Driving Experience Mercedes Has to Offer - Bloomberg ===

The 2017 Mercedes-Benz AMG SL65 is a hard-top convertible with a V12 horsepower engine that pushes it to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds. It costs $220,000, even before upgrades.
You’d think it would be the most expensive, most powerful convertible in the company's fleet. But it’s not.
That distinction belongs to a plush four-seater with a soft top, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz AMG S65 Cabriolet. This beauty has the same 6.0 liter, V12 engine with 621 hp and 738 pound-feet of torque. But it beats the SL65 in sheer gall, with prices that start at $247,900 and exceed $255,000 once you start adding options. And with a back seat that is actually viable as comfortable seating for people even more than five feet tall (a rarity with sporty convertibles), it feels much, much bigger.
If you want a wide, plush convertible that will more than hold its own against an even bigger catch, such as the Bentley Continental GT, consider the AMG S65. It’s quite expensive—maybe even too expensive, all things considered—but it delivers the most of what Mercedes has to offer for open-air driving. And that is more than enough for a memorable grand-touring experience.
I should note that fuel economy is just 14 mpg in the city, so expect to pay the $1,300 gas-guzzler tax when you buy it. That’s two mpg better than the Bentley and one mpg better than the 
 but equal to the M6 Convertible if you buy that one with automatic transmission.
Thing is, if you’re the type of person who wants what this car has to offer, you won’t care. It can hit 60 mph in 4 seconds, with a top speed of almost 190 mph. These numbers beat most sports cars, period, let alone convertibles.
I drove a diamond white AMG S65 for a week recently all around New York City and upstate in the Hudson Valley. It takes a lot for a white car to draw attention—usually that tone makes even the most dynamic body look bland—but this one beat the odds. Its twin-blade grill, high-gloss splitter, and chrome accents, even on the air intake, dressed up the bulging sides and rear enough to catch some looks. Yes, really. Photos don’t do it justice. Mercedes has also included exclusive 20-inch forged alloy rims with tiny thin spokes polished to a sheen, if you want them, and you do. It’s just as well—anything smaller would look diminished on this fatty. Did I mention the LED headlamps have Swarvoski crystal accents embedded inside them? Yeah, that too.
Oh, and I did mean fat when I said it—this car is two inches wider than the BMW M6 Convertible (nine inches if you include the mirrors), and at 4,971 pounds, 491 pounds heavier. It’s still roughly 500 pounds lighter than the Bentley Continental GT, though just as wide across.
Keep the microfiber-lined, three-layer fabric top down to get the best-looking angles, even though with the top up, it’s exceedingly quiet inside. (The neck-level warming “Airscarf” vents come standard, as do heated front door panels and console and the signature wind deflector, so you can drive the car in considerably cooler conditions than you could otherwise stand. Heated front arm rests, dual-zone climate control, and the heated rear seats and steering wheel are all optional.) The car I drove had a black top, although beige, blue, and red are also available. It deployed in 17 seconds.
In short, the AMG S65 makes a very big statement: Roll it down the road, and BOOM, everyone notices. The phenomenon would be even stronger if you bought the car in a dark color, such as navy or slate, so keep that in mind when you’re shopping.
Some of the attention should be chalked up to the engine note, I imagine. It’s almost tactile in its coarseness, like the sound of driving over gravel put over loudspeakers. (Related: I’m not a fan of over-carbonizing everything on cars, but the AMG carbon fiber engine cover on this thing is a great touch, because it shows off the monster underneath.) Anyway, the AMG S65 is more powerful than Mercedes’s similar AMG S63 cabriolet (V8, 577hp), so it stands to reason it would have a bigger voice to match. If you pay the $71,500 difference between them, that rougher demeanor is part of what you get, in addition to the additional torque, speed, and space—this is the more assertive of the two in every way.
You will certainly feel assertive when you drive it. The alcantara-covered AMG steering wheel ($500) is very thick, as are the knobs, the windshield views, and, really, the entire personality of this car. Driving up to Bear Mountain last Friday, I felt as though the car was hogging both lanes on the parkway—eagerly, almost greedily. The car comes with a smooth, solid, AMG-tuned 7-speed automatic transmission, with antilock intelligent braking to match the plush responsive steering. The driving feeling here would be ponderous if not for Mercedes’s progressive stability control, active dampening suspension system, and “curve dynamic assist,” which uses torque vectoring brake technology to even out control and precision in turns that lean on rear-wheel braking.
A price of $255,000 is a lot to pay for any car, and Mercedes has done its best to make it worth your while. The front seats come with massagers in addition to the power heaters and ventilators (the seats in the rear are optionally heated); there is voice control and Bluetooth and illuminated sills on the doors specially designed to close with the soft sound of luxury when you slam them. Take that description as you will—what is the soft sound of luxury, anyway, if not the singular sound of a very expensive car door shutting reassuringly behind you.
Carbon fiber and black piano lacquer trim ($3,700 extra) encircle the cabin of the car like a vault; you could be forgiven for treating the Nappa leather seats like lazy boy recliners instead of places for driving. They’re stuffed almost too full of padding to be comfortable. Only 
 and 
 give a more thickly appointed interior in a convertible on the market today.
Those are the only two automakers who give the same amount of room in the back seat, as I mentioned. Compare the Aston Martin Vanquish Volante or DB9 GT Volante or BMW M6 Convertible with this when it comes to performance, but they can’t compete with the AMG S65 if you want a proper back seat or if you want the biggest, boldest statement you can make without dipping into Bentley range.
You’ll also, of course, find Mercedes’s famous safety systems in abundance here—such things as active parking, surround views, active blind-spot assist, night view, and pedestrian recognition all come standard. So do the heads-up display and speed limit assist, which tells you the speeds on any given road, regardless of what signs are posted, and the adaptive high beams, which basically look around corners for you while you fly by at night.
Collision assist is a very real and delicate thing here too—this system physically changes the course of the car if it catches you off guard heading north, say, on the FDR. Attention Assist monitors driving patterns during the first 20 minutes of driving and then measures that profile against future driving action to see if you need a break. (It checks such things as steering inputs and all systems of the car that monitor time of day and what buttons are being pushed.) The driver assistance package mitigates collisions via an automated braking and cross-traffic alert.
It’s all a lot to take in, and a lot to manage, and this car isn’t for everyone. Those looking for ethereal driving beauty or raw connectedness to the road should look elsewhere. The Mercedes AMG S65 is a major car for people who want major driving experience. Is that you? Choose accordingly.

Tuesday night at a private residence in Los Angeles, Mercedes-Maybach unveiled the S650 Cabriolet, a four-seat convertible aimed at the wealthiest auto buyers on the globe.
The $323,000 V12 soft-top is the first of its kind from the ultra-high-end Mercedes-Maybach line, meant to tap the recent success of other expensive drop-tops such as the 
 and the 
.
While the Rolls delivers the world's best in hand-built automotive craftsmanship, and the Bentley delivers racing-caliber speed and performance, the Mercedes inhabits the spot between them, blending characteristics of performance and opulence. Most who buy it will be consumers loyal to German engineering who simply add it as their latest open-air option in garages already stuffed with luxury brands. 
The Mercedes-Maybach Cabriolet is the first of its kind—but hardly the first example of Mercedes tapping this uppermost echelon of car buyers: The brand debuted a six-meter-long 
 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in August; its 
 and $192,000 Mercedes-Maybach S600 sedan launched last year. This new convertible is the logical progression of the line. 
Such super-expensive cars tap into a market of global wealth that remains thirsty for exclusive product, regardless of economic factors; the margins on Mercedes-Maybach's newest cabriolet are especially high, considering that many of its underpinnings had already been developed for the previous Mercedes-Maybach S Class. 
Mercedes-Maybach’s Cabriolet also includes many of the appointments that make the similar $220,000 
 distinctive: the warming system that blows warm air onto passengers’ necks, the supple leather sewn into intricate patterns on the seats; and an internal fragrance system that scents the cabin of the car.
It comes with Swarovski crystals embedded into the headlights and a matching luggage set. (But where's the 
?) Last year's AMG SL65 can hit 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds, which is faster than its Maybach counterpart, but the more recent of the two is the grander model.
Buyers in the United States can choose to have it in one of three color combinations: Zircon Red with a white-and-black interior; Cote d’Azur Blue with a white-and-saddle-brown interior; or Diamond White with white-and-yacht-blue interior.
Better yet: Top performance is 621 horsepower; top speed will likely approach 200mph. That's enough to put Rolls and Bentley on notice. 
Mercedes-Maybach will make 300 in total of the S650 Cabriolet; 75 of them will go to the United States. Production begins next year.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

=== Title: Toyota, Merck Join Ethereum Group to Build Blockchain Network - Bloomberg ===

An effort to transform how businesses work by using blockchain technology added new members from multiple industries as Toyota Motor Corp., Merck KGaA, State Street Corp. and other companies joined industry group the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.
They join existing EEA members JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP LP, Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and ING Groep NV that are all trying to determine if shared databases recorded on the ethereum blockchain can cut costs by speeding up financial transactions or ensuring the efficiency of a supply chain. The reason ethereum is creating such interest among industries from finance to health care is because it allows for much more complex actions to be done in a shared and decentralized manner than with bitcoin, which introduced the first blockchain to the world in 2009.
The bitcoin blockchain is like a banking system that runs itself -- but its main use is just to allow people to move the digital currency from one place to another. Ethereum’s ledger does more. It stores fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts on its blockchain: If person A performs job B for company C, it will trigger a payment of D back to A and so on. Ethereum is a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once you can create contracts -- which are just operating procedures -- you can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization.
“The enthusiasm around EEA is remarkable," Julio Faura, chairman of EEA and head of blockchain innovation at Banco Santander SA, said in a statement announcing the additions to the group. "Our new members come from varying industries such as pharma, mobile, banking, automotive, management consulting, and hardware.”
Toyota, for example, is experimenting with ethereum to help it develop self-driving cars and other uses. 
"Toyota Research Institute supports the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and its members in promoting common standards and tools to accelerate the adoption of this technology and the potential benefits for Toyota’s customers,” Chris Ballinger, chief financial officer of the car company’s unit Toyota Research Institute, said in the statement.
John Hancock Financial is experimenting with a tailored version of ethereum to keep track of compliance with know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations in its wealth management unit. European aircraft maker Airbus SE wants to know if its supply chain management can be shifted to a blockchain.
Merck, which says it’s the world’s oldest chemical and pharmaceutical company in the world dating back nearly 350 years, said its history isn’t stopping it from being innovative.
"Curiosity fuels business development and enables companies like ours to remain competitive," Andreas Schindler, director ideation, innovation and technology foresight for the company, said in the statement. "We are curious to co-create with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance on distributed ledger architectures and solutions for future digital markets in health care and life sciences.”
Adoption of blockchain technology such as ethereum has significant hurdles to overcome, such as convincing competitors to work together in a network that shares market information. There is also the fact that very few if any actual uses of blockchain have been released to date. Regulators also have to be convinced the system is safe.
And the EEA is far from alone in seeking an edge in creating standards for blockchain systems. Competitors include R3, Chain, Digital Asset Holdings and the Hyperledger Project.

=== Title: Best New Luxury Cars at 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show: Preview - Bloomberg ===

Next week at the 
, manufacturers will introduce more than 50 brand-new vehicles to the car-buying public.
,
,
,
, and 
 are skipping the show altogether in favor of targeted driving and VIP events—an 
 by some of the 
. 
 and 
, similarly, will wait until later shows to offer anything new.
But others, including 
,
,
, and 
, will offer significant world debuts.
“The luxury brands are cautiously optimistic this year,” said Matt DeLorenzo, the managing editor at Kelley Blue Book. “The market has hit a plateau, with the luxury segment still locked in at 12 percent of the total market. But on the other hand, it’s a great time to be a luxury car buyer because the luxury market is full of options. The L.A. show is going to underscore that with plenty of new introductions.”
Luxury automakers will primarily be showing large sedans, crossovers, and SUVs, the last of which makes sense considering the fact that the U.S. is the world’s largest SUV market. Much attention will go to 
, which will introduce its first SUV, the Stelvio, on Wednesday.
“The Stelvio is a big deal for Alfa Romeo if they really want to get a foothold and reestablish themselves here in the U.S.” DeLorenzo said. “That SUV is going to be a make-or-break vehicle for them.”
Details on the saccharine-sounding rig remain scarce other than the expectation that it will borrow its body design largely from the 
. Stelvio will compete against the Audi Q5 and BMW X3. It is expected to go on sale in early 2017.
More concretely, 
 will show the First Edition Dynamic version of its best-selling Discovery SUV. 
will show a new X5 xDrive 40e as well as updated models throughout its SUV and sedan lineup. 
 will premiere an AMG E63 Sedan along with an unconfirmed new car from its top-end 
 line. (Ahead of the show, Mercedes-Benz announced its new AMG GLE43 SUV, which will replace the GLE 400.)
One possible sleeper SUV that could garner some hype for its good looks is the 
 QX Sport Inspiration Concept. Infiniti has released little information about the car, but 
 show that it has the gently rounded hood and sharp side angles of a futuristic luxury carriage.
Among domestic makers, 
 will bring the 2017 Escalade SUV and the enormous Escala concept sedan it showed briefly in August at the
. The Escala, which takes its name from the Spanish word for “scale,” comes with a 4.0-liter V8 engine and an interior lined in wood and aluminum. 
will show its new Cascada Convertible, Encore, Envision, and LaCrosse.
The fact that Cadillac won’t put an all-electric or autonomous powertrain in the Escala is surprising given how much hype those two drivetrains typically receive in L.A. press and popular coverage.
What’s more, the show this year has gone so far as to recast itself as an “
” show, with the first days of the event featuring seminars and panel discussions on such future transportation issues as 
, car sharing, and the connected car. The pivot is a way for the L.A. event to compete with the increasingly popular Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which automakers attend with increasing fervor. But analysts have pointed out a potential conflict with that shift: The purpose of an auto show is primarily to promote cars consumers can buy in the near, rather than distant, future. 
“Autonomous driving cars are not here yet, that’s the problem,” DeLorenzo said. “
 looms rather large. The purpose of an auto show is to sell cars. You can buy cars with semi-autonomous features, but a full hands-free, drive-me-home-type car is still far away.”
Maybe that’s why 
 has said it will not bring its 
 plug-in electric sedan to the show.
Still, buyers looking for green(er) vehicles have plenty to choose from.
Cadillac will show the 
, an all-new, rear-wheel electric car producing total system power of 250kW (equivalent to 335 horsepower) and 586 newton metro (roughly 432 pound-feet) of torque. 
 will add an AWD Panamera Hybrid (priced a bit less than $100,000) to its 
, plus two newly efficient engine variants and a host of now-standard creature comforts.
Elsewhere, BMW Group’s 
 will give the world premier MINI Countryman with a plug-in hybrid option. The 
brand will also offer a BMW 740e xDrive sedan, BMW 330e, and a massively updated 
.  
BMW won’t be the only one to show a new halo car of sorts. 
will also be announcing a totally new halo car at a swanky party before the show, along with showing a 
 
 at a separate, off-site event later in the week. Jaguar had announced earlier this year that it would indeed resurrect the classic XKSS, which was originally a two-seat D-Type that won Le Mans three years in a row from 1955 to 1957. The curved work of art is widely considered the world’s first supercar.
 will deepen its impressive lineup here with previews of the blisteringly fast 
 line: Spots with an AMG GT C Roadster, AMG GT Roadster, and AMG GT R are all planned. What it won’t have, Mercedes executives say, is that 
: “While a pickup is under consideration for the U.S. market at some point, no timeline is available for a decision to be made,” a spokesman said in an e-mail earlier this week.
Along with an A5 Cabriolet, 
will have a special collector's edition R8 V10 supercar that comes with laser lights.
The Los Angeles company 
will show its 3D-printed Blade supercar; it claims the car will use a a 700-horsepower bi-fuel engine that goes from zero to 60 in two seconds. Another fringe sub-brand, 
 will show its first concept supercar at an event in downtown L.A. The brand has said the car is a two-door, two-seat, rear-wheel-drive Corvette V8 engine machine. It will get 650 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque on its eight-speed transmission, according to a press statement.
, which announced 
 earlier this year, will not show in L.A., although its eponymous founder, Henrik Fisker, echoed the idea that the year will emphasize “electric mobility.”
There will still be one or two things for track-loving driving enthusiasts, however. 
will show a new Huracán Spyder rear-wheel drive. The open-top stunner is not a hybrid, and it’s certainly not fuel efficient. But the 
 will stand out as delightfully analogue among the myriad futuristic green machines expected at L.A.

=== Title: When Bad Things Happen to Rich People - Bloomberg ===

It’s that time of year when talk turns to beach reads, those narratives appropriate for a vacationer’s seaside repose. The greatest such book is 
, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s fourth and (no arguing) best novel. It’s set on a beach, first of all, deploying the French Riviera as a stage on which we witness, with sympathy and delight, the misfortunes of the very fortunate. Its excellence resides in Fitzgerald’s eye for trampled glamour, his ear for voices full of money, and his penetrating wit, as when he describes a woman’s shadowy social position “as the wife of an arriviste who had not arrived.”
The glitziest exemplars from this season’s mailbag include 
, the latest installment of Kevin Kwan’s franchise exploring the shopaholic progeny of East Asian tycoons, and 
, Christopher Bollen’s thriller about a disinherited New Yorker joining spoiled brats and sundry freeloaders on the Greek island of Patmos. But I prefer 
 (Flatiron Books, $25.99), the third novel by Grant Ginder. The summer’s most compelling fictional exploration of affluence and envy, it skillfully mingles the introspective ways of a domestic novel with the juicy stratagems of a page turner.
The bride is Eloise, a wealthy woman with an American mother, an aristocratic French father, and a job in public relations at what the 
 calls one of England’s “top 5 most shallow charities.” Wedding guests include Eloise’s two half-­siblings, Paul and Alice, the children from her mother’s second marriage, to an accountant in suburban Chicago. And, of course, the mother, Donna, who’s now both a divorcée and a widow. She’s also a stoner. And can’t find a thing to wear.
The book’s sensitivity about the ways in which wealth informs personal relationships is matched by its examination of how it deforms them. The resentment of Eloise’s half-­siblings—on account of her privileges and their sense that their “mother always treated Eloise a little differently”—runs deep. The first chapter finds Paul and Alice marshaling their resources of math, logic, and internet access to estimate that Eloise spent $4,500 on invitations. Their passionate analysis of paper stock recalls the intensity of 
’s Patrick Bateman, seeming to foreshadow sororicidal mayhem.
The bloodshed here, however, is contained to a paper cut Alice sustains when ripping open the invitation. Sucking on the wounded finger, she cringes “at the metallic taste: her blood … was nothing but a fistful of pennies.” The author is capable of describing more nuanced psychological knots, as when Alice, who works at a company called Think Big Data, reflects on the wealth of her boss, who’s also her illicit lover: “Typically, confronting unchecked privilege sends her into a rage, a downward spiral that begins with frustration over the moral wrongness of global inequality and ends with (
) a sort of ­solipsistic meditation on all the nice things she can’t afford, but others (read: 
) can.”
It is Ginder’s nature to lay things on thick, though in a pleasant way, as if spreading herbed ricotta on artisanal bread. There’s a bravura set piece in which Alice, in England for the wedding, books a room at the deluxe London hotel Claridge’s to impress Eloise, never mind the $6,000 of further credit card debt she’ll accrue. At check-in, she learns that Eloise has paid not only for the room but also for an upgrade and all incidentals. Alice’s reaction to this masterpiece of ­passive aggression—an act of showing off masquerading as one of ­generosity—is to binge on minibar booze, Klonopin, and room service: “I’d like five English breakfasts please.” Her desperate self-­defilement makes for a great, grotesque scene.
Money is a comprehensive subject of inquiry here, on every level—sociological, emotional, and literary. Paul’s boyfriend, Mark, is a behavioral economist with an unbecoming obsession with the currency of prestige. Perhaps you can guess where things are heading when Mark arranges for him and Paul to stay with a colleague whose research involves “the risk-reward analysis of remaining faithful in monogamous relationships.”
Alice’s boss, meanwhile, is an up-to-the-minute incarnation of tech-guy vanity. She, for her part, selects the spots for their clandestine dinners by looking at the restaurants’ websites and waiting to feel “the strange arousal she often experienced while flipping through catalogs from Room & Board and travel brochures from American Express.” 
 leaves the reader feeling both compassion for and condescension toward the unrich siblings, for whom the category of “people we hate” clearly includes “ourselves.”
The book is, in this way, especially well-suited to this summer of our discontent. The first sunny season of the Trump era is sure to inspire chaise-longue jitters about the ascent of moneyed vulgarity and whether one’s own back—ramrod straight with anti-Trumpism though it might be—could be among the first against the wall when the revolution comes. The laughter the novel inspires, at Alice’s screwball adventures in status anxiety and at Eloise’s demented quest for 3,000 unscented white 10-hour votive candles, is cathartic. Like all the best beach reads, it eats the rich like so many frozen grapes.

=== Title: Bitcoin Surge Is Driven by People Leaving Riskier Digital Currencies, Say Execs - Bloomberg ===

Bitcoin’s dramatic surge may be more than just a speculative frenzy. The recent rally is being driven partially by enthusiasts rotating out of riskier digital assets and into the more established cryptocurrency, according to industry executives.
"A lot of the volume into bitcoin right now is actually not dollar or yen or euro into bitcoin, but is rather alt digital assets," said Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO of digital asset software platform 
, at an 
 conference Tuesday that brought in 2,700 people on the first day. “People do view a lot of these newer assets as more risky, and so when they make big gains there, they’re selling down those gains and rotating into bitcoin."
Numerous alternative cryptocurrencies, or "
" such as ripple, have emerged since bitcoin broke into 
 in 2013. Companies can sell new tokens through initial coin offerings, or ICOs. While the cost of one bitcoin has skyrocketed to more than $2,000 from just 8 cents in 2010, you can buy one 
 for about $30.
The price of ether, the cryptocurrency tied to the Ethereum blockchain, has almost doubled in the last week.
Some are worried that there’s a 
 in the making, but Smith and Erik Voorhees, founder and chief executive officer of cryptocurrency exchange 
, aren’t too concerned. Booms and busts are a normal part of any economic cycle, they said at the Consensus 2017 conference.
"Every time bitcoin goes through these bubbles, a whole new wave of users come in," Voorhees said. "The reason that bitcoin is taking off is because banks have not been innovating."
The surge has also been 
 to global political uncertainty and increased interest in Asia. Chinese stocks have slumped in recent months as bitcoin soared. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 6.9 percent from its high this year on April 11 amid concern authorities will step up measures to crack down on leveraged trading. China also may publish bitcoin regulations in June, according to a report earlier this month.
"Bitcoin up 100% in under 2 months. Shanghai down almost 10% same timeframe, compared to most global stocks up. Probably not a coincidence!" Doubleline Capital CEO Jeff Gundlach wrote in a 
 Tuesday.
ShapeShift users, only about 15 percent of whom are in the U.S., are moving small amounts of value between different digital tokens as they speculate about the best place to put their money, Voorhees said. Bitcoin is the "least speculative" of the digital assets, he explained.
Smith’s company, which 
 former Barclays Plc CEO Antony Jenkins as a board member last year, has grown every year regardless of bitcoin’s price, he said.
"One of the beautiful things about bitcoin is you get to see free-market economics at work every day, and bubbles and creative destruction are part of that process," added Smith, who said people have been incorrectly writing bitcoin’s obituary as it goes through natural up and down cycles. "I’m sure we’ll add a lot of obituaries if the market reverses and we go down below $2,000."

=== Title: Fidelity's Abby Johnson Urges Resolution to Blockchain Barriers - Bloomberg ===

Abby Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of Fidelity Investments, urged a broad group of software developers, entrepreneurs and academics to work together to solve problems that are preventing the broader adoption of blockchain technology.
"You are the community who will drive the future of this technology. I challenge you to start collaborating together -- and I don’t just mean with people that think like you -- we need to be having hard conversations,” Johnson said in prepared remarks Tuesday at the Consensus 2017 conference in New York.
Johnson told the gathering of the blockchain industry that her firm isn’t giving up on digital currencies despite hurdles. She pointed to several barriers to blockchain adoption, including limits of the technology, policy issues, control of the systems and customer usability.
While blockchain technology has drawn 
 from the financial industry because of its potential to free up billions of dollars in capital, it also faces significant hurdles, such as convincing competitors to work together in a network that shares market information. Regulators must also be convinced that linked networks of computers can be trusted to manage aspects of some of the world’s most important financial markets.
JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP Plc, Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and ING Groep NV are among companies trying to determine if shared databases recorded on the blockchain can cut costs by speeding financial transactions or ensuring the efficiency of a supply chain.
Fidelity has invested in blockchain through venture deals with TradeBlock, Axoni and Boost VC and forged academic partnerships to explore the area, Johnson said. The firm’s innovation group, 
, has also been conducting research and experiments in the area.
"Blockchain technology isn’t just a more efficient way to settle securities -- it will fundamentally change market structures -- and maybe even the architecture of the Internet itself," she said.
The virtual currency bitcoin introduced the world to the first blockchain in 2009. Since then, a more expansive type of software has gained attention. Called ethereum, its blockchain does far more than allowing bitcoin users to send value from one person to another as easily as sending an email.
Ethereum is gaining interest among industries from finance to health care because it allows for much more complex actions to be done in a shared and decentralized manner. It stores fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts on its blockchain.
Ethereum is a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once participants create contracts they can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization.
Still, such technology isn’t able to offer scalability, privacy and peer-to-peer settlement all at once, she said. Fidelity is focused on investing in privacy since that’s important to customers, Johnson said.
Johnson also encouraged the industry to have an open dialogue with regulators because the technology’s rapid growth is making it difficult for them to keep up.
"Talk with people on the opposite side of the argument. Talk with people who are using these products. Talk with big businesses and the regulators. And come talk to us -- we need to hear your voice," she told the conference.
Johnson, who has been CEO since 2014, took full control of Fidelity from her father, Edward "Ned" Johnson, in November 2016. She’s the third generation to run the company and, like her family members, keeps a low profile. The firm had $6.1 trillion in assets under administration, including managed assets of $2.2 trillion, as of April 30.

=== Title: Next WannaCry Cyber Attack Could Cost Insurers $2.5 Billion - Bloomberg ===

Cyber crime insurers largely avoided costly claims from the recent attacks that hit businesses around the globe. The next global virus could change that.
“It’s exceptionally likely that we will see an event over the next months that will seriously affect insurers,” Graeme Newman, chief innovation officer at 
, said in an interview. “It would only need a combination of WannaCry’s wide reach and Petya’s destructive force to cost cyber insurers something like $2.5 billion, or a full year of gross premium income in the market.”
Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc 
 its full-year sales forecast on Thursday after a global cyberattack last month disrupted manufacturing and distribution for the maker of Air Wick fresheners and Dettol cleaners. It was the first detailed indication of the financial toll by a major company. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, which had to shut down systems across its operations to contain the cyberattack, 
 it’s too early to predict the impact on its results.
Hackers may learn to develop even more dangerous tools after attacks such as the WannaCry virus in May and the Petya attack that 
in Europe in June by freezing access to computers, allowing the attackers to demand ransom to unlock the systems. Those events didn’t result in meaningful insurance claims because they didn’t affect many companies in the U.S., where currently more than 90 percent of the cyber insurance market is located, Newman said.
CFC underwrites approximately $100 million of cyber-insurance premiums, making it one of Europe’s biggest sellers of the product, and has sold the coverage since 2000. As a Lloyd’s of London-backed 
, the company underwrites on behalf of other insurers. The global market for cyber insurance grew to about $3.4 billion in premiums last year and could rise to between $8.5 billion and $10 billion by 2020, reinsurer Munich Re 
. CFC saw its premiums in the market climb by more than 60 percent last year and Newman expects to match that this year.
“Sooner or later we, will see a billion-dollar cyber claim and the insurance market is well positioned to absorb that,” said Thomas Seidl, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London. “Everybody has exposure to cyber risks and the best precaution can’t eliminate that, so there is a strong demand for insurance making cyber coverage by far the 
 for non-life insurers for the next years.”
The largest cyber writers are 
, 
, and 
, according to a 
 by Fitch Ratings. The companies had a combined market share of approximately 40 percent at the end of last year and “over 130 distinct insurance organizations reported writing cyber premiums for the year.”
Low claims, combined with more companies entering the market, mean that prices for cyber coverage have been falling globally. They are down about 10 percent in the U.S. and about 20 percent in the international market this year, according to CFC’s Newman.
“It’s still a market where supply by far exceeds demand,” he said. “There is no break in supply with new insurers entering the market.”
With cyber coverage growing rapidly and insurers increasingly seeing the segment as their 
, regulators are concerned that the industry could be taken by surprise.
Insurers writing cyber policies “are expected to introduce measures that reduce the unintended exposure to this risk,” the U.K.’s Prudential Regulation Authority said in a 
 on Wednesday. It said insurers may face payouts from computer related claims from less specific policies such as general liability or property insurance.
“Although we have not yet seen large insurance losses, recent near misses highlight the large systemic potential of malware in a connected world,” said Marta Abramska, associate director in PricewaterhouseCoopers’s cyber insurance practice. “The regulator expects insurers to fully understand their exposure.”
In the U.S., the largest insurers offering cyber coverage are already adjusting their business by shifting away from packaged to standalone policies, which represented 70 percent of direct premiums written in the U.S. last year, according to a June 26 
 by ratings firm A.M. Best.

=== Title: What's Next for Bitcoin After Digital Currency Split Is Averted - Bloomberg ===

With the bitcoin development community 
 a software upgrade known as SegWit2x that aims to increase the network’s transaction capacity, a split of the cryptocurrency appears to be avoided. As proponents of the change celebrate, here’s what some have to say about what may be next.
“We’re going to see greater utility of the network. Now people can use bitcoin as a way to transit value more easily, more quickly, more cheaply. And that tends to attract in new users to the network."
“Going forward, there will probably be open-blockchains like bitcoin, which tends to move more slowly or conservatively, but there will be other blockchains like ethereum that may move more quickly and introduce a larger surface area for developers to build on top of. I think both of those things complement each other, not compete with each other."
“It’s a great step for bitcoin. There were a lot of question marks, obviously this has been in contention for quite some time now, but reaching consensus for how to scale bitcoin further is a huge step, clearly. SegWit activating and allowing things like Lightning Network is going to be huge for allowing more activity with existing user base, and down the line once we start to expand the blocksize, we’ll be able to expand the number of users on the network."
“The fact BIP91 came through is a good signal that everyone wants to be growing this network further. And there’s a lot of ways that it’s accomplished, but the fact there is way forward is encouraging. You’ll never know what happens between now and a few months down the line, in the cryptocurrency space especially, but I’m encouraged everything we saw in the past few weeks. A lot of question marks are starting to get answers."
“The BIP91 lock-in would be extremely significant for bitcoin and one of the first steps towards scaling the network. Work and discussion around ‘scaling bitcoin’ has been ongoing for years -– with the first dedicated conference around the topic beginning in 2015."
“After BIP91 locks in, approximately two weeks later SegWit should go live. Beyond that, there is still risk that bitcoin could split into different chains supporting different maximum block sizes (like a SegWit 1MB chain and a SegWit 2MB chain)."
“Bitcoin doesn’t have a Turing-complete language like ethereum, but there are some new interesting things that will enable to do be done once SegWit -- and then layer-two features like Lightning -- are implemented."
She gave a few examples:

=== Title: FedEx's TNT Reels From June Cyberattack as Damage Lingers - Bloomberg ===

FedEx Corp.’s TNT unit is still slogging through some transactions by hand and information systems may never fully recover from a June cyberattack that is expected to deal a blow to earnings.
The shares fell the most in two months after the courier 
customers continue to experience widespread service and invoicing delays. While TNT facilities are functioning, they have been forced to rely on manual processes for a significant portion of operations, FedEx said in a 
 Monday.
“The biggest risk to FedEx is potential loss of market share,” said Kevin Sterling, a senior analyst at Seaport Global Holdings. “You’ve got to believe DHL and UPS are calling up customers” in Europe to lure them away from FedEx. “Customers like to track things, and they may not be able to.”
The difficulty could reduce FedEx’s earnings by 50 cents to $1 a share for the year through next May, Citigroup Inc. analyst Christian Wetherbee said in a note. That represents 4 percent to 7 percent of the $13.50 he estimated for earnings.
The FedEx statement underscored the fallout from the June attack, in which the perpetrators demanded $300 in cryptocurrency to unlock infected computer networks. Unlike traditional forms of ransomware, the hack appeared to focus on crippling systems rather than obtaining payments. The email address posted on users’ locked screens to receive decryption keys was swiftly shut down by the email provider.
FedEx acquired Dutch shipping company TNT Express for $4.8 billion last year to gain an extensive parcel delivery system in Europe and compete with United Parcel Service Inc. and 
’s DHL.
“We cannot yet estimate how long it will take to restore the systems that were impacted, and it is reasonably possible that TNT will be unable to fully restore all of the affected systems and recover all of the critical business data that was encrypted by the virus,” said FedEx, which owns the world’s largest cargo airline. 
FedEx fell 1.7 percent to $215.27 at 2:21 p.m. in New York, after tumbling as much as 3.4 percent for the biggest intraday decline since May 17. Separately, medical-technology company Medtronic Plc fell the most in six months after its chief financial officer 
 that a computer crash unrelated to an attack would crimp quarterly sales. 
Shipping company 
, another victim of the cyberattack, told customers on its website that it would reactivate transport-plan notifications and cargo checklists starting Monday. The Danish company said last week that it was “steadily getting closer to business as normal.”
The Petya virus affected TNT through tax software used in the Ukraine. Other operations haven’t been affected by the attack, FedEx said. The Memphis, Tennessee-based company said it found no evidence of a data breach or information lost to third parties. FedEx declined to discuss details beyond the statement. TNT primarily serves the industrial, automotive, high-tech and health-care industries.
FedEx is still evaluating the financial effect and said it didn’t have insurance in place that would cover the cyberattack. It is too soon to quantify lost revenue from decreased shipping volumes and other costs of putting contingency plans and repairs in place, the company said.
“We take some solace that no data breach is known to have occurred, which should limit a longer-term lasting impact,” Benjamin Hartford, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., said in a note.
FedEx was among companies affected by the WannaCry ransomware in May that affected an estimated 200,000 computers worldwide. That attack didn’t cause a material disruption to FedEx systems or result in material costs, the company said.

=== Title: Bitcoin to $50,000 Is Latest Call From Prolific Stock Picker - Bloomberg ===

Ronnie Moas, who for the past 13 years has made more than 900 stock recommendations via his one-man show at Standpoint Research, is now venturing into cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin will double to $5,000 next year, and reach $25,000 to $50,000 in the next decade, the Miami Beach, Florida-based Moas said in a note to clients Wednesday, where he also disclosed he bought “a little bit” of litecoin, bitcoin and ethereum in a Coinbase.com account.   
It’s a testament to the exuberance around bitcoin, ethereum and other blockchain assets that equity investors who hadn’t been involved in cryptocurrencies are now starting to analyze and make bets on the sector along with established 
 who see long-term gains, even if they say there might be a correction after the recent rally.
“There are only 21,000,000 bitcoins in circulation and the world will fight over those 21 million coins as confidence in currency and other investments deteriorates,” Moas wrote, referring to the algorithm that caps the amount of bitcoin that can be created. “I have little doubt that 1% of the money in cash, bonds, stocks and gold will end up in cryptocurrencies.”
Bitcoin has more than doubled this year to as high as $3,000 as adoption increased, more institutional investors backed blockchain technology and the second-biggest digital currency, ether, started to become popular in fundraising rounds for tech startups. Bitcoin slid to as low as $2,544.40 today from its high on June 12 on concern that digital currencies can’t reach wider acceptance fast enough and that their gains have been overdone.
Moas says he’s “only a bit concerned that there may be a near-term bubble,” but long term, there’s the potential to make triple-digit returns.
Moas recommends securing cryptocurrency positions through services like the one offered by Trezor.io and reminds clients his post is for informational purposes only and shouldn’t be viewed as investment advice or as a recommendation.

=== Title: Cyber Crime Fears Drive Up Demand for Anti-Hacker Insurance - Bloomberg ===

For companies and organizations, an attack by hackers can inflict financial losses, corporate embarrassment and legal action. For insurers jumping into the brave new world of cyber crime insurance, it’s free marketing for what could be a $10 billion opportunity.
High-profile computer breaches like the 
of the Democratic National Committee and the 
 are reinforcing the need for protection against cyber threats, and companies such as 
and 
 are eager to step in. Insurers see coverage against hackers as one of their most promising markets, estimating that premiums will triple over the next four years.
“We are optimistic that it can develop into Allianz’s and the industry’s next blockbuster,” Hartmut Mai, chief underwriting officer for corporate lines at Allianz’s industrial insurance arm, said in an interview. “Cyber insurance is our key growth area at the moment.”
A new breed of coverage couldn’t come at a better time for insurers, which are struggling to expand in most of their established markets amid slow economic growth and low catastrophe claims that weigh on prices. Insurance premium income stagnated in Europe last year and is 
 to grow 1.3 percent next year, according to reinsurer 
. The company estimates that cyber insurance premiums could rise to between $8.5 billion and $10 billion by 2020 from about $3.4 billion currently.
A further boost to demand may come from rules to be 
 next year by the European Union that will require companies to 
 cyber breaches to regulators and affected individuals.
Allianz currently writes a double-digit million-euro amount of cyber insurance premiums and recorded 28 percent growth last year, according to Mai. He said the product may 
 into an industry bestseller comparable to directors-and-officers liability insurance, which became a top offering during the last decade and now accounts for about 10 billion euros ($11 billion) in global premiums.
“Cyber risk has become a boardroom issue over the past years, following some high profile hacker attacks,” Paul Bantick, head of cyber insurance at Beazley, said in an interview. “We haven’t seen the 
 at the retailers such as in 2015 or the large health-care breaches that occurred in 2016. Yet, there’s still a high frequency of smaller losses.”
Cyberattacks 
 -- in which criminals use malicious software to encrypt a user’s data and then extort money to unencrypt it -- increased 50 percent in 2016, according to a report from Verizon Communications Inc. Criminals increasingly shifted from going after individual consumers to attacking vulnerable organizations and businesses, the report said.
Government organizations were the most frequent target of these ransomware attacks, followed by health-care businesses and financial services, according to data from security company McAfee Inc., which partnered with Verizon on the report.
While companies have had decades, and in some cases centuries, to work out the risks of fire, natural catastrophes and physical theft, cyber crime is relatively recent, with new and more sophisticated schemes being developed every year. With damages on the rise, the biggest challenge for insurers is to set the right price and limits for their coverage. One in four medium-sized businesses in Germany have suffered a loss from a hacker attack, according to a survey 
 March 28 by Germany’s GDV insurance lobby group. 
“For insurers to stay relevant in an ever more technology-driven business environment, they need to embrace the opportunity while properly managing the risks,” Thomas Seidl, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London, said in a note to clients on April 24.
Like Munich Re and Allianz, Beazley also sees rapid growth in cyber insurance. The Lloyd’s of London insurer partners with Munich Re to provide the product and it’s running the book at a profit. To make sure that continues, insurers are careful not to take overly large risks in the nascent market.
“We limit our coverage to $100 million per client, of which both Munich Re and Beazley take $50 million,” Beazley’s Bantick said. “In bigger programs, the $100 million is just a first part, with others providing additional coverage.”
The scope of cyber insurance varies from one provider to the other. Typically, it protects against data and network security breaches and associated losses, and insurers limit their capacity to between $5 million and $100 million per client.
A customer fact sheet prepared by insurer Chubb Ltd., which counts the U.S. as its largest market, described a claim where hackers gained access to a school district’s network to steal names, addresses and account information from 20,000 past and present faculty and students. Compensation included settlements from compromised individuals, costs of responding to a regulatory investigation and public relations fees. Other cases included a data center for an online retailer that was forced to shut down temporarily and a car components maker whose system was encrypted to extort ransom.
A recent study by risk modeler Risk Management Solutions Inc. found that “if all U.S. businesses had cyber insurance, over $5 billion a year would be lost to the insurance industry from cyber data exfiltration alone. Data breaches are the leading cause of cyber insurance loss.”
One concern is that a global cyber event such as a devastating virus spreading from Asia to Europe and the U.S. or a global cloud computing provider breaking down could affect a large number of companies covered by one insurer.
“A hurricane with a probability of happening once in 25 years could cost us as much as $150 million and the whole industry about $30 billion,” said Hiscox CEO Bronek Masojada in an interview. “Due to the lack of history, the question with cyber is whether a $30 billion loss happens once in 25 years or once in 100 years. The most important question is whether we will be alive after it.”
In terms of growth, “cyber is by far the most important part” of the business at Hiscox right now, he said. The London-based insurer will write more than $100 million in cyber premiums this year at a growth rate of 20 percent to 30 percent, Masojada estimated. 
Cyber insurance premiums at Beazley already exceed $400 million, excluding broker commissions, Bantick said. Munich Re’s premium income from the product rose to $263 million last year from $191 million in 2015. The Munich-based reinsurer aims to keep a market share of 8 percent to 10 percent going forward, reinsurance head Torsten Jeworrek said. 
Beazley’s Bantick says his company is “starting to see shoots of demand in Europe, Latin America and Asia.” Allianz’s Mai agrees, adding that he sees last year’s strong growth rates as “the product’s final breakthrough in Europe.”
Prices are on the rise as well. In the U.S., cyber-liability rates climbed for the 10th consecutive quarter at the end of last year while rates continued to decline in most other global insurance lines, according to a 
 by broker Marsh & McLennan Cos.
“While there are a lot of companies buying cyber coverage, most of them are data-breach driven,” Beazley’s Bantick said. “But clients are looking for large, holistic cyber programs that cover whatever happens from data breach to property damage and business interruption.”
’s experience is a lesson in the complexity of cyber risks. The German cable manufacturer lost 40 million euros last year when fraudsters used fake electronic communication to trick an executive into transferring the cash to foreign accounts. In the end Leoni got about 5 million euros from fidelity insurance it had. Even though the company had sufficient cyber insurance in place, it didn’t apply because the fraudsters didn’t hack the company’s systems.

=== Title: Ransomware Becomes Go-To Hack as Bitcoin Rallies, NSA Tools Leak - Bloomberg ===

A recent outbreak of ransomware attacks, from the WannaCry worm in May to 
 around the globe, shows that digital stickups are becoming the go-to hack for cybercriminals, fueled by powerful leaked U.S. government exploits and the rise of bitcoin and other anonymous digital currencies.
Tuesday’s attack showed no signs of slowing down, as cybersecurity researchers had not found a kill switch similar to the one that allowed them to stop WannaCry after it had infected hundreds of thousands of computer in more than 150 countries, preventing it from becoming one of the worst attacks on record.
The new infections, which appeared concentrated in Ukraine before spreading globally, are a sign that ransomware is becoming a routine risk of doing business, as other forms of attacks get less profitable. Banks and retailers have strengthened their defenses, driving the price for stolen credit card numbers down to as little as 50 cents apiece, according to 
 from Symantec Corp., the biggest cybersecurity software maker. But ransomware demands are on the rise, nearly tripling from an average of about $300 per computer infected in 2015 to more than $1,000 each last year, Symantec said. Earlier this month, a South Korean web hosting company agreed to pay 
 to unlock its servers in what’s believed to be the biggest ransomware payout on record.
"The new versions of ransomware are the perfect crime," said Jack Danahy, co-founder of Barkly Protects Inc., a Boston-based cybersecurity firm. "It’s super-easy to do -- monkeys could do it -- and the profits are remarkably high. And the third thing that makes it perfect is anonymity, because nobody wants to get caught. That’s why this thing is growing."
It’s possible that Tuesday’s outbreak may not spread as quickly or be as damaging as WannaCry, whose early victims included hospitals in the U.K. that had to shut some services while dealing with cleanup. The new malware uses an exploit called EternalBlue to spread by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Corp.’s Windows operating system, similar to WannaCry. But many of those weaknesses have been patched for months -- meaning that many computers already have protection against its key propagation mechanism.
The new malware does have additional capabilities that let it spread by other means through internal networks, so anyone who clicks on a malicious email attachment could put their entire organization at risk.
The rise of ransomware has coincided with two other major changes in the cyber black market. The first is the growing amount of leaked attack tools from the U.S. government available online. The second is the growing use of digital currencies, which give hackers an easy and potentially anonymous way to get paid. The malware unleashed Tuesday demands payment of $300 in bitcoin. The reason many ransomware operators ask for relatively small payments is that the amount needs to be low enough that enough people will pay, but high enough that it’s worth the effort to attack. Given the secretive nature of cryptocurrencies and the shadowy world in which cybercriminals operate, it’s virtually impossible to get an accurate read on exactly how much the hackers rake in.
Because there’s a glut of credit card and identity data for sale on the black market, it’s gotten harder for criminals to get paid, said 
, chief of security strategy for SentinelOne. But rather than try to sell data to a third party, attackers instead encrypt it -- demanding that the victim pay to get it back.
"Who better to value the data than the owner of the data?" Grossman said. "It’s market forces at work."
There are signs that hackers are shifting tactics in favor of ransomware. According to a 
 by IBM, the amount of spam containing ransomware surged to 40 percent by the end of 2016 from just 0.6 percent in 2015. While many ransomware attacks are blocked by security software, the number of infections getting through is growing. Symantec said it detected 463,000 ransomware infections in 2016, 36 percent higher than the year before.
But Tuesday’s attack contained some puzzling elements to security experts, raising concerns that it may not have been about payment at all.
Like WannaCry, which the U.S. government has 
 linked to North Korea, the new attack does not have the usual characteristics associated with hackers who want to maintain control of the infected computers and facilitate payment and easy decryption of locked files. That the hardest hit country is Ukraine, whose power grid and other critical systems have been the target of repeated high-level hacking attacks blamed on the Russian government, raised suspicions among some researchers that another motive could be at play. Anton Gerashchenko, an aide to the Interior Ministry in Ukraine, wrote on Facebook that the goal appeared to be “the destabilization of the economic situation and in the civic consciousness of Ukraine” even though it was “disguised as an extortion attempt."
"There’s something weird about this one," added SentinelOne’s Grossman.

=== Title: Why You Should Collect a Vintage Audi 100 - Bloomberg ===

Here’s a way to guarantee you stand out: Buy an Audi 100.
Not the newer one, the one made in the 1980s. You want the one with the bigger silver Audi rings and fresher body, the one made from 1968 to 1976.
This is the car Audi made secretly at first as a way to claim brand individuality under Volkswagen ownership. (In 1966, Auto Union, an amalgamation of four German automakers that was the immediate predecessor to Audi, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagenwerk AG. But the carmakers that had been moved to VW headquarters in Ingolstadt were forbidden to develop their own vehicle. Head of Development Ludwig Kraus broke ranks, but early reviews proved so successful VW decided to produce it shortly after its debut.)
The Audi 100 was the first car Audi ever sold in the U.S. It's not expensive. It's not powerful. But it's rare: Of the 1 million collector cars Hagerty insures, only six of them are Audi 100s.
“If you came across one, it would be a very affordable way to have a unique vehicle that you’d likely be the only one to have at your cars-and-coffee meet-up or the local car show,” says Jonathan Klinger, the vice president of communications at Hagerty. 
If you want to own a vintage model that shows you’ve put some real thought into your purchase, they’re ideal. These are 
 starting point for all modern Audi cars, the first of the breed. (Bonus points for looking cool.)
“It’s an appealing choice for the enthusiast interested in a significant, practical, and very rare German car,” David Traver Adolphus, the heritage car expert at Hemmings, 
 in the company’s annual classic car report. 
One look at that fresh face, and you’ll be sold.
Audi started importing the 100 series for the 1970 model year, even though it had shown and started hyping the car in 1968. The idea was it would help convince American consumers Audi could compete with the other European luxury brands entering the U.S. at the time—namely, BMW and Mercedes.
“The Audi 100 was a car that was developed when the European luxury brands were starting to be more relevant globally,” said Mark Dahncke, Audi’s general manager of communications. “The big U.S. titans were losing relevance because of the gas crunch and also, honestly, because of their design. The Audi 100 was a step to bring in a European solution: something that was compact but usable, drivable but functional.”
Audi also used the 100 to show global buyers that the brand had really kicked its old Auto Union identity (Auto Union had became a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagenwerk AG in 1966). Kraus, a star designer and engineer who directed many of Mercedes’s successful Formula 1 cars, drafted the look.
The coupe-size bodylines and delicate pavilion roof immediately stood out compared with the heavier steel and muscle cars Detroit was making at the time. Even though the four rings on the Audi logo represented the four brands of automobile produced at the time by Auto Union—Horch, Wanderer, Audi, and DKW (aka 
The Small Wonder)—the change was enough to make an impact. Everything in Audi’s modern fleet can trace its design back to this car. 
“The engineers in Germany were developing cars that were a little bit more forward thinking in terms of efficiency and understanding that you couldn’t go down the road in just anything as heavy as you want,” Dahncke said. “That’s why the Audi 100 got its introduction. And later it influenced everything to the Audi A4. It set the table for all things that came thereafter.”
The first 100s were front-wheel drive sedans with 4-cylinder, 112-horsepower engines. They came with a four-speed manual or automatic transmission on a short, sturdy chassis. The police used them often because of their agility and on-road practicality (a two-tone police paint finish, flashing blue light, and siren were applied after the factory).
In later years, the coupe and saloon versions became popular and came with a long list of such standard design features as twin headlights and chrome wheel arches that helped boost its price. It didn’t hurt that in some light, from some angles, the Audi 100 Coupé S also looked similar to the Aston Martin DBS.
By the last years before its update in 1976, the Audi 100 came in seven different variant and trim levels, plus a coupe and sedan version in the U.S. Audi sold more than 6,500 of them during the first year, which was more than expected, and nearly 800,000 of them globally and 300,000 in the U.S. over the entire model run. Today, fewer than 1,000 roadworthy examples exist in the U.S., according to 
.
It means you’re going to have a tough time finding one. And you’ll probably need a specialist to help connect you with 
 in Europe: Casual searches on EBay motors, Autotrader, and Carsforsale.com typically result in no viable options for sale. They do come to auction from time to time, but inquiries at Gooding & Co. and Sotheby’s didn’t return recent results. 
, and 
 
 of 
 but little commerce.
They’re rare because they were practical: U.S. buyers bought them and drove them into the ground. And since they weren’t expensive at the time, it wasn’t worth restoring most of them.
“It’s the case of a cool car that was used up,” Klinger said. “It was a utilitarian vehicle—they were used and then repurposed and then discarded, so you’re left with a small sample of what was produced.”
In other words: pounce. It probably won’t cost you much—as little as $4,000 online in the U.S., although prices can reach $62,000 
 for one in mint condition. 
 in Europe saw later versions of the sedan, which originally sold for less than $4,000, fetch roughly $8,000. Top resale values for the 1970 LS two-door sedan in the U.S. hover around $7,000, according to KBB’s collector car senior market editor, Phil Skinner.
It’s no blue-chip investment. But if you buy one, you’ll retain your money and then some—it’s a lynchpin of Audi history. Major key.  
“It will hold its value,” Klinger said. “Don’t look for any drastic swings either way. But for the people who remember those vehicles when they come across them, it’s a legitimate collector car.”

=== Title: Intel Tries to Squash AMD Revival With New High-End Chips, Brand - Bloomberg ===

., trying to head off a fledgling attempt by rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to compete in the market for high-end personal computer processors, introduced a new more-powerful chip.
The company will begin selling chips with as many as 18 processing cores under a new Core i9 brand aimed at gamers. The world’s largest chipmaker said it’s reaffirming its commitment to providing the fastest PC chips available.
’s only competition in PC processors, 
, has demonstrated its new Ryzen product outperforming Intel chips. AMD is trying to muscle in on one of the 
 attractive parts of the PC market with new products the company began offering in the first quarter.
Intel estimates that video game enthusiasts and others who are willing to pay for the best computer performance represent a market that will grow as much as 20 percent a year. That’s amid a total PC market that has shed more than 100 million units since it peaked in 2011, declining each year since then.
Underlining just how profitable the high-end processor market can be, the top of Intel’s new range -- called the i9-7980XE -- will go on sale for $1,999 per chip. That’s more than most people will pay for their entire computer.
Intel has maintained more than 80 percent market share and higher average selling prices in PC chips by consistently providing processors that outperform rival offerings. Its strength forced out competitors leaving only AMD, a company that hasn’t turned a profit in five years.

=== Title: Hardly Anyone Paying the Hackers? Because Using Bitcoin Is Hard - Bloomberg ===

An unprecedented 
 swept across the globe over the weekend, but so far the majority of victims haven’t paid hackers a ransom.
After the ransomware began infecting users on Friday, they were given 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin -- chosen by the hackers because the crypto currency is harder to track than conventional payments -- or pay twice as much. If they refused to pay after seven days, their computer would be permanently locked -- a serious problem for those who haven’t backed up their data.
As of early Monday, only about $50,000 had been paid in ransoms, according to 
, a London-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands, adding that it expects the total to rise.
"The amount is indeed low," said Michela Menting, digital security research director at 
. "This is likely due to the fact that organizations have initiated their backup and recovery procedures."
Moreover, for those who didn’t save their data on a separate system, paying a ransom isn’t like buying something from Amazon by entering their credit or debit card information. Even though the hackers provided a helpful link for those new to paying in bitcoin, the crypto currency is a black box for most people.
"If you’re presented with something that says pay this amount in bitcoin, most people don’t know where to start with that," said James Smith, the CEO and co-founder of Elliptic.
There are several steps. First, a person or business has to obtain the bitcoins by registering with one of the various online exchanges and going through its verification process. After that, money can be deposited into the exchange. For those living in countries that don’t have an exchange, including the U.K., money must be converted into another currency.
Once the money is deposited on the exchange, the bitcoins can be sent to the address provided by the extortionist. "It looks like a long garbled string of text," Smith said. After the fee is paid, the hackers supposedly free the affected computer.
"A large amount of bitcoin is actually somewhat difficult to source quickly," said Alex Sunnarborg, an analyst at bitcoin research company CoinDesk, adding it might take a few days to create an account at a bitcoin brokerage or exchange, connect a bank account, and then receive the bitcoin.
One notable difference with this attack is that the perpetrators demanded a relatively small amount of money but from a large number of people, said James Chappell, chief technology officer and co-founder of U.K. security company Digital Shadows.
More typically, he said, hackers demand one large ransom to unlock all the infected machines. "Quite often they’re in the thousands rather than the hundreds of dollars," he said. "It is unusual to see this piecemeal approach, computer by computer."
Although harder than tracking a traditional bank payment, hunting down the bitcoin payments will be a key way law enforcement authorities attempt to track down those responsible. It’s almost impossible to know who the perpetrators are based on the bitcoin addresses they give to victims, according to Elliptic, but once the bitcoins are moved from that address, it can be tracked, potentially helping lead to the culprits.
"There are things you can do to identify the actors behind suspicious addresses or transactions," says Kevin Beardsley, head of business development at Elliptic, which also works with law enforcement.

=== Title: Inside the Secret Meeting Where Wall Street Tested Digital Cash - Bloomberg ===

On a recent Monday in April, more than 100 executives from some of the world’s largest financial institutions gathered for a private meeting at the Times Square office of Nasdaq Inc. They weren’t there to just talk about blockchain, the new technology some predict will transform finance, but to build and experiment with the software.

=== Title: Bitcoin Retreats as Another Cryptocurrency Offshoot Appears - Bloomberg ===

First there was bitcoin, then bitcoin cash -- and now there’s bitcoin gold.
A new iteration of the cryptocurrency has been formed after some developers split the blockchain, the digitized ledger on which the bitcoin is based. Called bitcoin gold, the offshoot comes less than three months after bitcoin cash was created.
While independence from any central authority is part of bitcoin’s appeal, that’s also made it more susceptible to such so-called “hard forks” when there are differing visions within the cryptocurrency community. Bitcoin gold aside, bitcoin miners and developers have been embroiled in a debate lately over an upgrade of its protocol that’s aimed at speeding up transactions. A lack of consensus is threatening yet another schism next month.
"This is what will be required to make fair mining accessible to the general public once again," said Robert Kuhne, a strategist at the bitcoin gold project. "A successful fork will prove that bitcoin always has the ability to escape from any potential abusive mining hardware manufacturers," who he blamed for "unnecessary stalling" this year.
Early trading of bitcoin gold was volatile, with prices ranging from $60 to $200 on several exchanges. The new cryptocurrency traded at $98 as of 11:21 a.m. in Tokyo, according to exchange Bitfinex. At that price, its market capitalization stood at about $1.6 billion, making it the world’s eighth-largest cryptocurrency, according to data from coinmarketcap.com.
As groups supporting different digital networks and related currencies jockey for dominance, some may be trying to undermine bitcoin gold’s efforts. The official website went down Tuesday as hackers sought to prevent users from accessing it in what are known as denial-of-service attacks. Bitcoin gold developers said on Twitter that the site is fielding 10 million requests per minute, and they are working with providers to halt the attackers.
Bitcoin dropped 3.3 percent to $5,413 as of 11:18 a.m. in Tokyo after falling as much as 5.9 percent a day earlier when the split occurred.
“Bitcoin’s recent downturn has been driven by the traders’ anticipation of minor disarray in the wake of the upcoming hard forks,” said Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin Ltd. “The bitcoin exchange and wallet community has been divided over their decisions to support or reject these contentious hard forks.”
Bitcoin gold’s main innovation makes it easier for people without special hardware to mine the digital asset, according to its 
. Instead of powerful mining machines called ASICs used in bitcoin, users can mine it with standard gaming graphics cards, similar to how mining is done with 
, the website says. After the split, bitcoin owners stand to receive one bitcoin gold for each bitcoin, assuming their wallets or exchanges support the new creation, it said.
Further splits may be imminent. One faction of the community wants to increase bitcoin’s blocksize in order to shorten transaction times, while another is opposed. The first phase of this plan, called SegWit2x, was implemented in August and took some of the data off the main network.
Bitcoin gold faces hurdles for wider acceptance. Coinbase, one of the largest online cryptocurrency exchanges, has said it won’t support bitcoin gold because of questions about its software. Coinbase doesn’t trade bitcoin cash, though it will let users withdraw it from their so-called wallets starting in January, since bitcoin owners automatically received bitcoin cash after the first fork.

=== Title: Cryptocurrency Flash Crash Is Said to Draw Scrutiny From CFTC - Bloomberg ===

A popular digital-coin exchange is drawing scrutiny from U.S. regulators over a June flash crash that erased most of the value in the second-largest cryptocurrency before traders had time to blink their eyes.
The 
 has requested information from Coinbase Inc. about a June 21 incident on its GDAX platform in which the ether digital token suffered a precipitous drop, falling to 10 cents from $317.81 in milliseconds before quickly recovering, said two people familiar with the matter.
Among the issues the agency is focused on is what role leverage might have played in the plunge, as 
 allowed traders to use borrowed money to make bigger wagers than would have otherwise been possible, said the people, who asked not to be named because the review isn’t public.
The CFTC inquiry is the latest sign that federal authorities are growing worried about a market with scattershot oversight that has attracted big money. Coinbase, which says it has served 10.6 million customers and facilitated $20 billion in digital currency transactions, is regulated by various states through a patchwork system.
It’s not registered with the CFTC, the main U.S. watchdog of currency futures. Coinbase doesn’t allow traders to buy and sell derivatives, and firms don’t typically fall under the regulator’s direct jurisdiction unless they allow swaps trading. Coinbase does hold licenses with financial agencies in dozens of states, as well as Puerto Rico, according to its website.
The CFTC sent San Francisco-based Coinbase a letter with a list of questions, including queries about margin trading, one of the people said. Coinbase began offering margin accounts in March, as it sought to attract institutional investors by providing them loans to amplify their bets. The company disabled the service after the June crash.
“As a regulated financial institution, Coinbase complies with regulations and fully cooperates with regulators,” the company said in an emailed statement. “After the GDAX market event in June 2017, we proactively reached out to a number of regulators, including the CFTC. We also decided to credit all customers who were impacted by this event. We are unaware of a formal investigation.”
CFTC spokeswoman Erica Elliott Richardson declined to comment.
Coinbase’s 
 was caused by a single $12.5 million trade -- one of the biggest ever -- that prompted selling by other investors. The decline triggered automatic sell orders from traders who’d requested to bail on the currency if prices dropped to certain levels, and led GDAX to liquidate some margin trades.
While the drop was dramatic, it was also temporary. Computer algorithms quickly started issuing buy orders that drove prices back up to $300 within 10 seconds.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have surged this year. But regulators and financial executives are concerned that investors are inflating a bubble that’s destined to pop. South Korea banned margin trading in bitcoin and ether Sept. 29 after China earlier cracked down on digital currencies. Last month, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon likened cryptocurrencies to the infamous Dutch tulip bulb mania of the 17th Century.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has been grappling with how to police digital currencies. SEC Chair Jay Clayton 
 lawmakers last week that initial coin offerings are probably full of fraud. The next day, the agency 
 a company for misrepresentations tied to a bitcoin offering purportedly backed by diamonds and real estate.
One risk of allowing margin trades is that in a sharp market reversal, trading platforms could run into problems if investors can’t repay the money they’ve borrowed.
That’s what happened in January 2015 when the currency brokerage FXCM Inc. almost toppled after Switzerland shocked markets by letting its currency appreciate. When the franc jumped, FXCM customers lost more money than they had in their accounts, forcing the company to seek a $300 million bailout from Leucadia National Corp.
Coinbase’s GDAX had a margin funding limit of $10,000. To qualify, investors had to meet at least one of several 
 laid out under federal law.
For instance, individuals can only trade with borrowed money if they have more than $5 million invested in various financial markets and are using their margin accounts purely to hedge risks. Individuals are exempt from the hedging requirement if they have more than $10 million invested. The rules are looser for institutional investors, such as hedge funds and corporations.
Last year, the CFTC 
 a different digital token market, Bitfinex, for allowing investors who didn’t meet the $10 million threshold to make margin trades. Bitfinex also broke the law because it didn’t deliver some bitcoins that investors had bought using leverage within a required timeframe, the CFTC said.

=== Title: BMW Motorrad Vision Next 100 - Bloomberg ===

On Tuesday in Santa Monica, Calif., BMW Group debuted a motorcycle concept so artificially intelligent that it eliminates the need for the rider to wear protective gear, including a helmet. 
The BMW Motorrad Vision Next 100 motorcycle is the latest incarnation of BMW’s Vision Next series, which 
 of the German brand with forward-looking concept vehicles from 
, 
, 
. The group has been hosting events around the world this year to debut each new concept in a different city. California’s event, held in an 
, displayed the motorcycle along each of the group's other previously shown concepts. This is the fourth and final of its concepts to be shown. 
So what does the future of motorcycles hold? 
At least according to BMW, it's a bike that has self-balancing systems to keep it upright both when standing (a boon for novice riders, on par with training wheels for bicycles) and in motion (beneficial for experienced riders who want erudite handling at high speed). Several systems—one BMW calls a “Digital Companion,” which offers riding advice and adjustment ideas to optimize the experience, and one called “The Visor,” which is a pair of glasses that span the entire field of vision and are controlled by eye movements—correlate to return active feedback about road conditions to the rider while adjusting the ride of the bike continuously depending on the rider’s driving style. (Sure beats today's 
.)
It’s meant to equal the driverless systems automakers also expect to be producing in cars by 2040 and beyond.
“The bike has the full range of connected data from its surroundings and a set of intelligent systems working in the background, so it knows exactly what lies ahead,” said Holger Hampf, BMW's head of user experience. 
It also purports to use a novel matte black “flexframe” that's nimble enough to allow the bike to turn without the joints found on today’s motorcycles. The idea is that when a rider turns the handlebar, it adjusts the entire frame to change the direction of the bike; at low speeds only a slight input is required, while at high speeds it needs strong input to change course. This should increase the safety factor of riding a bike so a small twitch at 100 mph isn't going to shoot you in an unexpected new direction.
But not everything about this concept bike is forward-looking: The black triangle shape of the frame combined with the white trim lines and classic boxer engine form are meant to evoke the 1923 R32, the first motorcycle BMW ever made. The seat, upper frame cover, and wings are made of carbon, and the bike will run on a futuristic "non-gasoline power source." (Naturally; this is a concept, after all.)
Another uber-modern touch: The area at the front will have virtually no buttons except a red rocker switch on the end of the right handlebar.
The BMW concept motorcycle seems extremely far-fetched, and the group has released only rail-thin details about what to expect in terms of bringing it to production, if it ever does. But like all its Vision Next concepts, BMW execs said that they intended it that way. After all, they wouldn’t want to tip off competitors.
“Normally when we develop a motorcycle, we tend to think five to 10 years in advance,” Edgar Heinrich, head of design at BMW Motorrad, said in a press statement. “On this occasion, we looked much further ahead and found … some very attractive prospects.”

=== Title: How to Get a First Class Upgrade Every Time - Bloomberg ===

Until recently, if you had even mid-tier elite status with an airline, you could bet on getting upgraded from economy to business or first class on many, if not most, of your flights. Not anymore. These days, scoring a free upgrade has become the exception rather than the rule of frequent flying. Here’s why—and what you can do about it.
“Upgrades are getting harder to come by,” explains Gary Leff, founder of the points-and-miles blog 
, “because airlines are 
 in a way they didn't used to.”
A healthy economy in the United States and other countries means there are more premium fliers—and more people with cash to lay out on paid upgrades. Plus, says Leff, first-class fares aren’t as expensive as they used to be, so it’s easier to lure travelers into buying. 
Some forty airlines, including Singapore, Etihad, and Virgin Atlantic, are now offering up premium seats for auction through a bidding platform called Plusgrade. Most of them let you make a bid a week before the departure date and notify you within a few days if you've won. And unsurprisingly, each successful bidder claims a seat that might have once gone to a frequent flier—for free. 
American legacy carriers have thus far resisted the auction trend, but upgrade availability has thinned for other reasons.
For one thing, major airline mergers—like those of Delta and Northwest, United and Continental and, most recently, American Airlines and US Airways—have concentrated the number of elite fliers into fewer programs. While the number of elites vying for upgrade spaces has ballooned, the number of premium airplane seats has remained constant.
All of this changes the dynamics of supply and demand. Says Leff, “Given how difficult it is to get upgraded, it incentivizes passengers to confirm their upgrades, for instance by redeeming miles, in advance. There are more miles in circulation now, too, so that's become easier as well.” The more fliers who redeem those miles for upgrades ahead of time, the more elite fliers there are commiserating in the back of the plane.
Even with the dwindling upgrade space and fiercer competition, you can still try your hand at an elite upgrade. If you understand how airlines dole them out, the system is yours to play, although by and large, carriers prefer to be cagey about their algorithms.
Each airline makes its own rules and weights various factors such as elite-status tier, specific fare codes, how much you’ve spent on your tickets, and whether you have a co-branded credit card. Parsing the terms and conditions of each carrier on your own could be a full-time job, so we’ve done the legwork for you.
 
Delta lays out what is probably the most detailed, and thus complicated, formula of factors for processing upgrades. The airline prioritizes Medallion status as the foremost factor. Then it ranks individual elites by the fare codes of their tickets. Those purchasing higher fare classes (a full-fare economy ticket instead of a discounted one, for example) have a better shot.
Pro tip: to guarantee you’re buying a full-fare ticket, select “refundable” under “fare preference” at the time of booking. You can also ask your corporate travel booker to double check on your behalf.
Assuming multiple passengers on a plane happened to be top-tier elites with full-fare tickets, there are four more tiebreakers that Delta can use. First is whether either flier carries the Delta Reserve credit card. That’s followed by business travelers whose companies are affiliated with Delta’s Corporate Traveler program. Next come Delta co-branded credit cardholders who have spent $25,000 or more on their Delta credit card in the current calendar year. And if there is 
 a dead heat, the date and time at which the upgrade request was originally submitted is the final decision-maker.
 
United’s formula is as convoluted as Delta’s, if not more so.
These days, you’re unlikely to qualify for an upgrade unless you have Premier Platinum status or higher and book full fares—cashing in miles or getting a discounted ticket will almost always take you out of the running.
Priority goes to top-tier Premier 1K elites, who have flown 100,000 miles or 120 segments and spent $12,000 on United tickets in a year—assuming they book full-fare tickets in the Y, B, or M fare classes. (Lower-tier elites qualify for upgrades if they book in Y or B fare classes only.)
United offers a sort of upgrade gift certificate when you qualify for the highest two tiers of status, so customers who want to apply those credits are next in line. And factors like time of booking or having a co-branded credit card can break ties in hairy situations.
 
Right now, American Airlines prioritizes elite upgrades based on two things: elite status and the time at which the flier is added to the upgrade waitlist. Status trumps upgrade sign-ups, but you can easily increase your chances at scoring an upgrade by booking tickets far in advance and requesting an upgrade immediately.
But along with major changes that recently hit the AAdvantage program—it now prioritizes dollars spent to miles flown—American recently announced that upgrade eligibility will be changing in 2017. While status tier (Gold, Platinum, Executive Platinum, etc.) will still be the first criterion, American will begin prioritizing upgrades based on annual spending. So if two Platinum elites have requested upgrades, the one who has spent more money on American Airlines tickets in the preceding 12 months will be higher up on the waitlist.
Fine text on the airline’s website also indicates that other factors, like the time at which you check in to your flight, can also play a role, albeit a very minor one. It’s vague terms like these that make American the bane of so many frequent fliers’ existence.
 
Despite swelling elite ranks and increased competition, savvy fliers can bypass coach without submitting themselves to a game of upgrade roulette. A few strategies:
 If you buy an economy fare, you can still use frequent-flier miles to buy an upgrade, though there can sometimes be cash co-pays. Plus, if you confirm your upgrade in advance, you won’t have to endure the nail-biting wait at the departure gate.
 It’s an especially attractive option for international travelers, given the breadth of carriers that have signed up. Policies and pricing vary from airline to airline and route to route, but you can often score deep discounts on otherwise unaffordable tickets.
 Airlines fly a variety of aircraft, even on the same routes, so you can alter your strategy based on the number of premium seats aboard your flight. Think both in terms of absolute numbers as well as the proportion of the plane they take up. High numbers and proportions translate to better odds.
 Flights with a lot of business travelers tend to have the most elite upgrade competition, so avoid those to improve your chances. “Don’t fly when most business travelers do, such as early flights on Monday mornings and Thursday and Friday afternoons between 5:00-7:30pm," says Leff. "Middle of the day Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are your best bet. Fly during the holidays. There are fewer business travelers on the road.”
 Leff suggests using a paid service like ExpertFlyer.com to keep tabs on how quickly premium seats are being snatched up for your particular flight. Depending on how fast they’re flying off the shelf, you can purchase an upgrade, redeem some miles for one, or to take your chances in the elite queue.
Don’t want to deal with the headache? Here’s one last strategy: Buy a discounted premium fare.
Airlines are pushing those premium seats and often prompt economy fliers with the chance to “upgrade” for “just a little more.” The offers continue at check-in and at the airport. Compare those offers to online airfares on the same routes to determine whether they’re worth taking. If you’re getting that business- or first-class seat at a deep discount, you might as well purchase it outright and not worry about the upgrade game.
 

=== Title: Monterey Auctions Continue to Slide After 2014 Classic Car Peak - Bloomberg ===

Auction values of 
 are down.
After four days of sales during the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance weekend, and its related events, the world’s 
 reported $344.9 million worth sold of cars, trucks, and motorcycles. That’s down 13.1 percent from last year’s $396.8 million total and down 13.8 percent from 2014’s peak of $400 million in sales.
A second consecutive year of down numbers for the Monterey sales is an important market indicator, because investors and enthusiasts use them as a gauge for the rest of the auction market and the general collector car market abroad.
“The message stemming from this year’s Monterey Auctions is that all but the most exceptional examples of a given model continue to level out,” McKeel Hagerty said in the Hagerty sales recap Monday morning. “Sellers who were testing the market have likely missed their window for now.”
There were some high points during the cold, foggy weekend in Monterey. Seven cars sold for more than $10 million and accounted for a record-high 32 percent of overall sales. That's significant because those seven cars alone represented nearly a third of total sales: "Even more than usual, the economics in Monterey were centered on the very top of the market," Hagerty's Jonathan Klinger noted. And records were set for prices paid at public auction for 
, 
, 
, and 
.
The average sale price for a car sold by Gooding & Co., Bonhams, RM Sothebys, Mecum, and Russo & Steele was $479,642. In 2015, that number was just slightly lower, at $456,067.
What’s more, cars made in the years from 1950 to 1979 seemed to hold their place in the collecting echelon. They saw a 58-percent sell-through rate, which was more than both the prewar and modern-classic groups. In general, cars from the 1950s through the 1970s also sold for much larger percentages above their estimated values, Hagerty reported.
The overall top seller for the weekend was the deep blue 
 that RM Sotheby's sold for $21,780,000, which was slightly below initial estimates. That was followed by a 1939 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B Lungo Spider that RM Sotheby's sold for $19,800,000 and a 1959 Ferrari 250 GT California LWB Alloy Spider that Gooding & Co. sold for $18,150,000.
Gooding was the winning auction house of the week, with cumulative total sales of $129.8 million and 114 of 137 lots sold, for an 83 percent sell-through rate. Last year, Gooding had slightly less in total sales ($128.1 million) but had a higher sell-through rate, of 89 percent.
In general, bidding in Monterey was sluggish, with sell-through percentages the lowest they’ve been since 2000. According to Hagerty data, the sales rate for cars priced at more than $100,000 dropped 15 points, from 72 percent sold last year to 57 percent this year. And even cars priced for less than $50,000 saw a three-point drop in their sell rate.
“It seems that buyers are more in tune with the new market-adjusted prices than sellers at the moment,” Hagerty said. “They are not allowing themselves to pay for future gains now.”

=== Title: Why the BMW R NineT Scrambler Is Better Than Its Pricier Predecessor - Bloomberg ===

BMW just debuted 
so smart you won’t need to wear a helmet. The concept, called the BMW Motorrad Vision Next 100, won’t make it to production for years.
So you’ll have to pacify yourself with something simpler in the meantime. May I recommend the $13,000 
? Just skip over the $15,095 
 that came out last year and get this one. This Scrambler isn’t as flashy as the 
 or as inexpensive as a 
. But even more than last year's R nineT, it combines the free feeling of vintage café racing with the excellent German engineering that often sets BMW far above its peers.
(For clarity, in the rest of this article I'll call the new 
 the Scrambler, and I'll call the 
 the R nineT.)
First of all, the overarching reason to buy the Scrambler rather than the standard 
 is that the former is just generally way cooler. Think James Dean breaking hearts as he rolls through town, not your uncle who rides a hog on the weekends. But if you need more specifics, here are eight reasons to get the newer bike.
 The base price of the Scrambler is $13,000, although the one I drove around Brooklyn and Manhattan last week cost closer to $15,000. The base price of the R nineT is $15,095. If you’re wanting to save money on the Scrambler, stick with the standardized steel tank, telescopic forks with gaiters, and the basic speedometer (vs. an optional rev counter and multifunction display). I should note here, too, that the R nineT comes with BMW's upside-down telescopic fork, as opposed to the traditional telescopic forks with 43 mm fixed-tube diameter on the Scrambler. The latter is better on uneven terrain; the former is suited to smooth streets and highways.
The Scrambler’s 4.5-gallon sheet-steel gas tank comes in a monolithic brushed gray that looks like the ones Paul Newman rode in the 1970s. The R nineT has a polished black-and-white, two-tone exterior that looks a little like a spat. A Scrambler fuel tank option with hand-brushed aluminum and a sanded weld costs $950; the one with hand-brushed aluminum and a visible weld costs $850.
The Scrambler comes with a two-inch bigger front wheel than the R nineT and includes optional knobby tires. The large 19-inch alloy front wheel on the Scrambler harkens back to the historic bikes of the 1950s, when BMW introduced a BMW R 68 motorcycle at the International Bicycle & Motorcycle Fair IFMA in Frankfurt, Germany. Handsome cross-spoke wheels like the ones I had cost $500 extra. ABS comes standard.
BMW has made the dual exhaust pipes on the Scrambler sit snug to the frame of the bike and raised them higher than those of the R nineT. The pipes also have two vertical rear silencers, as classic Scramblers did, but retain the relatively deep rumble that boxer engines such as this one are known to make. I like how this looks much better—it keeps everything pulled in tight and close, better looking, and neater for riding. Chrome exhaust covers cost $150 extra.
The saddle-leather brown seat on the Scrambler is low and flat, fit for two-person trips or providing a good space for a backpack to rest for short trips. Seat grips are optional. This is more of a style differentiation than anything, and you can modify the bike as you see fit, including the seat apparatus, but since we are talking about the factory-issued versions here, I'm sticking with my vote for the Scrambler.  
Like the prior R nineT, the Scrambler version has a circular headlamp and speedometer with an analog display—all very much in the classic motorcycle way. The optional speedometer version shows important information, such as trip time, engine speed, and distance traveled (I always keep an eye on this to gauge fuel levels). The handlebars are set slightly high, which makes for a more upright riding posture. (Still, this bike is ripe for customization, and if I had my way I’d drop the bars to be really low and set close to the center of the bike.) The alarm system is optional, as are the heated grips on the handlebars.
 The seat of the Scrambler is 32.3 inches above the ground, vs. the 30.9 inches of the R nineT, which suits taller people and gave me (I’m 5 feet, 10½ inches) a preferred vantage point as I rode it through Brooklyn’s sleepy afternoon traffic. I’m partial to dirt bikes myself, so with the deep-groove tires and $400 optional automatic stability control to boot, this was a pleasant medium. Still, I should note that there is less seat padding here than on the R nineT, and the rider footrests are positioned lower and further to the rear. You'll want this bike to ride for an afternoon or a weekend, not for a cross-country pilgrimage.
. At 485 pounds, the Scrambler is lighter than the R nineT by nearly five pounds. It's shorter and narrower than the R nineT by inches. That’s not a lot, but it does affect how it handles. You’ll feel the slight difference—the Scrambler runs a bit freer and faster to 60 mph than the R nineT. It still feels substantial, like a massive iron machine, but riding up the West Side Highway last week was a joy. The lowered suspension on the Scrambler is optional and worth it.
I should mention something very important, which is that the Scrambler comes with the classic air-cooled flat-twin 1,170cc boxer engine that has 110-horsepower and 86 pound-feet of torque. This is the same as the one in the R nineT; they each get 110 hp and can easily hit 125 mph, though the R nineT has one or two pound-feet more torque. But on the Scrambler, the engine is the single most distinguishing feature you notice; it sticks out on either side of the steel tubular space frame like strong shoulders that frame the long torso of a power forward. The moment you fire it up, you’ll recognize the Scrambler as a BMW in the best sense of the word—it rings more true as one of the winning machines BMW has been making for more than 90 years.
There are plenty of BMW official accessories on tap, more than come with the R nineT, including rear storage bags; knee-pads for the tank; a passenger seat with grab straps, a sports silencer; cylinder-head covers in chrome, silver, or black; and handlebar end pieces made of aluminum. But none overpowers the Scrambler’s relatively simple élan.
Are you getting the picture? BMW just dropped the massive 
 Bagger (watch out, Harley-Davidson), and you can find excellent café racer-style bikes from Triumph and Ducati. But when you want a classic, cool ride from the best-engineered motorcycle brand in the world, the R nineT is good, but it doesn't get you quite there. Go with the Scrambler. 
 

=== Title: Ten Travel Innovations That Are Totally Changing the Game - Bloomberg ===

With airline fees that won’t seem to go away, seats that seemingly keep shrinking, and global threats ranging 
, it’s easy to tell yourself that this is the year to stay home. But those who hit the road will find that so many pain points of traveling are being zapped by brilliant, game-changing innovations—some so good, you could almost say it’s a new golden age of travel.
 
This week, United Airlines 
 to begin installing automated security lanes at some of its hubs across the U.S., a move that American Airlines made earlier in the month. The new security setup is said to be 
; it uses CT-scanning technology to examine carry-on bags and personal items. Similar to the system used in Amsterdam’s Schiphol International Airport, the bins feed into a scanner; instead of having humans flag bins that need further inspection, this technology automatically identifies worrisome scans and pulls those items of luggage out of the queue, routing them to a control center. Most bags will breeze through, improving security line speed drastically.
Bonus: Thanks to the CT technology, you’ll also be able to leave liquids and laptops in your carry-on bags, assuming that the pilot is successful. Expect to see the new system at major airports such as Chicago O’Hare, Miami International, and more than a dozen others before the year’s end.
 
A newly launched plugin for Expedia called 
 allows you to input your various frequent flier numbers so that your flight searches include alternate prices—in miles. Instead of just seeing that a flight from New York City to Tokyo costs $677, for instance, you’ll also see that it earns 1,117 award miles. The mileage estimates can factor in multiple loyalty programs at once, and the plugin also breaks down what you will earn in both award and status qualifying miles for each purchase.
 
There’s nothing more frustrating than surviving a long, overnight flight only to find that your hotel room isn’t ready until 3:00 p.m. 
, which has five properties in Los Angeles, New York City, and Miami, intends to buck that trend by instituting a new policy called Standard Time. It lets guests check in at any hour of the day—and checkout is just as flexible.
The fine print says this is based on availability. Still, a representative confirmed that guests could check in at 6:00 a.m. and check out at 11:00 p.m., if they so wished, signaling even more flexibility than 
, which guarantees ultra-loyal guests a full 24 hours in their room.
 
It’s one thing to put a big-ticket, last-minute flight on a corporate card; it’s another entirely to book a spontaneous trip that’s just for fun. Now you don’t need to think twice about it. A new feature from the fare-predicting app 
 will alert you when there are breaking fare sales from your home airport to destinations you may be interested in. It also looks at where you’re interested in going and suggests similar, alternate destinations where the flights are more affordable.
For the really impulsive, the year-old, $10-a-month subscription service 
 sends text message alerts when there’s a notable fare drop—think $294 round-trip tickets from the U.S. to Europe or $355 return trips from various U.S. cities to Hong Kong, Taipei, or Seoul. (You can set your home destination to ensure that deals are relevant to you.) They’re not always last-minute fares, but they require you to act fast and can often be booked for nearly immediate travel.
 
If you snagged that last-minute flight, the rest of the trip is just as easy to plan. Apps like 
 will get you a place to stay on the same day you’d like to check in—and have been gaining traction for years. Last-minute 
 are newer. The largest is 
, which works in 12 U.S. cities. Internationally, you can use 
 in several Canadian cities and 
 in London.
 
Lost luggage hit an 
 in the U.S. in 2015 despite overall passenger growth—an impressive feat. Chalk it up to the expansion of self-checked bag drops, which ensure that the right tags go on the right bags, and pioneering programs by Alaska and Delta Airlines that guarantee you won’t wait for your bag at the carousel for more than 20 minutes. (On the off chance that you do, you’re handsomely rewarded, usually with miles.) Also helping: Smart bag tags from British Airlines, AirFrance, KLM, and Qantas help track bags around the globe, and smart luggage with built-in GPS tracking (such as the models from 
).
 
Booking a rental car is a painfully opaque process—you never really know what you’re going to get. But 
 has just launched a program that makes the shopping experience far more transparent. Sort of like Tinder for rental cars, 
 lets you swipe through the available cars in your destination until you find one you like. It also lets you bypass the rental counter by putting all the paperwork right on your phone. Once you’ve decided on a car and e-signed the rental agreement, the app also unlocks your car.
 
A little healthy competition is driving faster Wi-Fi in the skies. Two years ago, ViaSat introduced an ultra-fast, 12 mbps Internet service that’s now rolled out to United, JetBlue, Qantas, and El Al planes; its cutting-edge, high-capacity satellites are a notch above the ones that Gogo uses for its own in-flight Wi-Fi offerings. This February, American Airlines 
 with Gogo in order to provide its customers with the faster service, but Gogo responded by upgrading its equipment. High-speed Gogo service is due to roll out globally within the year—making it easier to get work done at altitude.
 
As much as premium economy cabins have been on the lips of every airline chief executive officer, some prominent carriers still have yet to roll out the offering that’s halfway between coach and business class. American will be the first U.S. legacy carrier to offer the product on overseas flights when 
 are launched this November—the seats will include extendable footrests, USB ports, and free checked bags. Delta will launch something similar in mid-2017, though details are still forthcoming. Perhaps most exciting are the 
, which were introduced on the carrier’s Singapore to Sydney route earlier this year. Those seats are as wide as 19.5 inches, feature eight inches of recline, and cost $80 million to install on just 20 A350s. (The cabins are now being rolled out on routes to major financial capitals around the world, including Beijing, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, London, and Tokyo.)
 
Elon Musk’s 
 is on its way to reaching viability, but it’s not the only ultra-high-speed transit option in the works. Bullet trains are 
 such as Kuala Lumpur and Singapore in the coming decade—transferring between those two cities would take a mere 90 minutes. And 
, a startup focusing on supersonic commercial planes, has recently gotten Richard Branson onto its list of investors; the Virgin Group optioned 10 of its planes before Virgin America’s merger with Alaska Airlines. (A round-trip flight from New York to London would cost roughly $5,000.) What’s more, NASA is developing 
 that it thinks will be in commercial production within a few years. What could be more emblematic of a new golden age of travel than the return of the Concorde?  

=== Title: Eleven Things I Never Knew About Flying ... Until I Became a Flight Attendant - Bloomberg ===

When you cram hundreds of passengers into a carbon fiber tube and shoot it across the sky, things are bound to go wrong. And no matter how dire the state of air travel seems—whether it's the 
 caught on a United Airlines flight or Delta's 
 last week—you, the passenger, are privy to only one side of the story.
So when 
 offered me the opportunity to become a flight attendant last month, I decided to find out what it’s really like to fly the not-so-friendly skies. Here’s everything I learned while serving as a crew member aboard their 787-8 Dreamliner long-haul service from London (LGW) to New York (JFK).*
This may seem obvious 
, but yes, flight attendants get free travel perks. And sometimes crew members are paid to fly on repositioning flights that get them to their next shift. They’re called “deadheads,” and they’re the most important passengers in terms of getting a seat on the plane, which is what led to the doctor in Chicago being forcibly removed from his United seat to accommodate one.
 
“Deadheads” is just the beginning. Did you know flight attendants play ping-pong on every flight? That’s what they call beverage service, thanks to the paddle-shaped trays they extend to fill your cup with coffee and tea (to avoid spillage of hot fluids). They also sleep in “crashpads”—shared apartments—when they’re off duty, which are often in “Crew Gardens” (that’s Kew Gardens—a neighborhood near NYC’s JFK airport—to most people). And live out of “Berthas,” or company-issued suitcases.
What they surprisingly don’t have a code name for: belligerent customers. But they 
 refer to problem passengers in “aviation alphabet,” i.e. “21 Golf” for the person sitting in 21G.
 
Flight attendants and pilots never get stuck with the same food you’re eating. They get a completely different set of menu items from the passengers, reducing the risk of food poisoning across the entire airplane. But don’t be jealous. My fellow crew members ate cold platters of sandwiches and chocolate bars. And the customers got surprisingly well-prepared dishes, made in real ovens rather than in microwaves.
 
According to Ilse, another Norwegian crew member, “We all agree that Scandinavians are the best passengers you could ever ask for: So content with being on board, and they don’t ask for much. Passengers traveling from the U.K. and U.S., however, are much more demanding, constantly ringing the bell. They tend to cause a scene and love threatening to sue.” 
 
It’s considered a federal offense to open and imbibe your own liquor on a plane, as the captains on Norwegian will tell you at the start of any flight. So put away the duty-free booze—or anything that’s not served by a crew member: Individual consumption can easily lead to handcuffs when you disembark. (And the crew will be onto you if you order nothing but a glass of ice.)
Don’t overdo it with the 
, either. Flight attendants keep careful tabs on how many drinks each passenger requests, and they reserve the right to refuse you service if you appear too intoxicated. One or two drinks at mealtime is considered standard—but if you’re slurring words, looking glassy-eyed, or making constant trips to the bathroom, the crew is likely watching.
 
After years of flying both in the front and back of the plane, I assumed that working in the premium cabins was a more coveted role: You’re in charge of fewer, more comfortable passengers. I was wrong. Billie Jean and Derek, two of my crew mates, explained that on Dreamliners, most flight attendants prefer the economy service. “Premium passengers aren’t any more or less demanding than economy passengers," said Billie Jean, "and it can be boring manning the galley away from the rest of the crew.”
 
Businessmen, babies, or blissed-out yogis: Which is most likely to annoy a flight attendant? Crew members agree: Yogis take the prize. “It happens at least once a flight, they come into our galley space and start doing stretches, or—even worse—push-ups,” said Ilse. Fellow crew member Grace and Derek agreed and said flights to and from the West Coast carried the greatest number of offenders by far.
 
Yes, it’s true: On transcontinental flights, flight attendants can take naps in a secret dorm room above the galley, through a door that looks like an inconspicuous closet near the lavatories. The berths are like plastic nests with full length-beds, sheets, pillows, and privacy curtains. And breaks are carefully timed: My team was divided into two groups, each getting one hour and 40 minutes of rest in the dorm. To avoid tardiness and miscommunication, the entire cabin crew syncs their analog watches—a wardrobe must—to the time of their destination.
 
Airplane bathrooms are not for the faint of heart. Their stench has even been known to 
.
Norwegian’s policy is to clean the lavatories every 20 minutes—and yes, that’s the responsibility of flight attendants. Fun fact: Attendants regularly cover up strong odors by brewing a large pot of coffee and pouring it down the toilet. It neutralizes both the bacteria and the smell.   
 
“It actually happens far more frequently than you think. I’d say at least once a month someone tries it, with about a 30 percent success rate,” Ilse explained. “We’ve even seen total strangers meet on a flight and make a run for the lavatory together.”
That’s about once every eight flights, if you do the math. As for the failed encounters? Suffice it to say that sprints to the lavatories are usually intercepted. “Sometimes I just want to give the passengers a ton of Purel and say, ‘what are you thinking?’” joked Grace. 
 
Contrary to popular belief, the cabin crew does indeed possess the ability to move you into premium seats. But there probably isn’t space for you.
If the front cabin isn’t sold out, initial upgrades go to airline employees first, then family and friends of the staff. 
Getting other types of freebies is easier: Just bring a fun snack on board to share with the crew. Think bags of candy. According to my colleagues, edible gifts are considered a kind of inter-airline currency and can be rewarded with free cocktails or other in-flight goodies. (Every flight team has the ability to override the computerized purchasing system.)
But if it’s that 
 you’re after, you’re just going to have to become a flight attendant yourself. And now that you’ve peeked behind the galley curtain, you’re almost ready to fly. 
 

=== Title: Cyberattacks Involving Extortion Are on the Up, Verizon Says - Bloomberg ===

Cyberattacks involving ransomware -- in which criminals use malicious software to encrypt a users’ data and then extort money to unencrypt it -- increased 50 percent in 2016, according to a report from 
And criminals increasingly shifted from going after individual consumers to attacking vulnerable organizations and businesses, the report said. Government organizations were the most frequent target of these ransomware attacks, followed by health-care businesses and financial services, according to data from security company 
., which partnered with Verizon on the report published Thursday.
Instances of 
 attacks have grown along with the market for bitcoin, the digital currency that is most commonly how cybercriminals demand ransoms be paid because of its anonymity.
While overall most malware was delivered through infected websites, increasingly criminals were turning to phishing -- using fraudulent emails designed to get a user to download attachments or click on links to websites that are infected with malware -- to carry out attacks. A fifth of all malware raids began with a phishing email in 2016, while fewer than 1 in 10 did the year before, according to the report.
"These emails are often targeted at specific job functions, such as HR and accounting -- whose employees are most likely to open attachments or click on links -- or even specific individuals," the report said.
Verizon is currently in the process of acquiring 
’s internet properties at a $350 million discount after revelations of security breaches at the web company. Yahoo said in December that thieves in 2013 stole information from 500 million customer accounts, from email addresses to scrambled account passwords. Such a data cache may allow criminals to go after more sensitive personal information elsewhere online.
Whereas in the past most ransomware simply encrypted the data on the device where it was first opened, Marc Spitler, a Verizon security researcher, said criminal gangs were increasingly using more sophisticated hacking techniques, seeking out business critical systems and encrypting entire data servers. "There is increased sophisticated surveillance and targeting of organizations to maximize profit," he said in an interview.
Criminal gangs were behind the majority of all cybersecurity breaches, Verizon said, with financial services firms the most common victims, accounting for about a quarter of all attacks.
But espionage - whether that was by foreign governments or unknown entities - was on the rise, Verizon said, accounting for 21 percent of all breaches in 2016 up from less than 10 percent in 2010. Besides governments, manufacturing firms were the most likely to be targeted in espionage-motivated attacks, the report said. There has also been a surge in espionage-related breaches targeting universities and other educational institutions, spiking from almost none in 2012 to more than 20 percent last year, it said.
The Verizon report, which is published annually, draws on the company’s own data from breaches its security consultants have responded to and data contributed by 65 partner organizations, including the U.S. Secret Service. NTT Security, a unit of Japan’s Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., released a report earlier this week that showed results similar to Verizon’s findings

=== Title: Twitter Swastika Hack Comes at Fragile Time for Company - Bloomberg ===

With revenue already forecast to decline this year, 
 can’t afford to spook users or brands. So it didn’t look good when an outside application on its social media service was 
, triggering a torrent of swastika-filled tweets.
Several high-profile accounts, such as Forbes Magazine, BBC North America, and Reuters Japan, 
 with Turkish-language hashtags like “NaziGermany” and “NaziHolland” on Wednesday, while posting content supporting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
The accounts had been using Twitter Counter, a marketing tool that lets people and businesses track their popularity on Twitter. Even though Twitter doesn’t own the tool and wasn’t directly responsible for the breach, the company’s shares slipped the most in more than a month.
“Anything that shows that Twitter is vulnerable is something that users and advertisers pay attention to,” said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer, who predicts the company’s U.S. revenues will decline this year for the first time. “We’re already seeing Twitter facing a lot of challenges on its business and a hack into a third party is not great news -- there’s a fear for personal safety as well as brand safety.”
Twitter’s longevity depends on prominent users, such as media companies, politicians and celebrities, continuing to post their latest information on the service first. Improving 
 has been one of Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey’s top priorities this year, following high-profile departures from the site due to harassment or abuse.
Security breaches can affect any company, but when they happen they can harm the perception of the business. Yahoo! Inc.’s sale to Verizon Communications Inc. was 
 and the price cut after revelations of two hacks. The U.S. government 
 on Wednesday of being behind a breach of about 500 million Yahoo accounts as part of a broad scheme pairing cybercrime with intelligence gathering.
Politically motivated cyber attacks are likely to become more common, as politicians and media organizations use Twitter to spread their message, said Jens Monrad, senior intelligence analyst at 
“Cyber threats don’t move backward," Monrad said. "If anything, the barrier to entry only becomes lower over time.”
Twitter said it quickly located the source of the issue and removed the third-party application’s permissions immediately. The company declined to comment on any changes coming to its relationship with third parties -- the slew of businesses that have built programs on top of Twitter’s network.
Twitter shares fell as much as 3.1 percent Wednesday, the most since Feb. 10, adding to what was already a 6 percent decline this year. The company is working toward profitability after a process to sell itself failed in 2016.
Twitter Counter is a little-known marketing company in Amsterdam used to track the popularity of posts on the social network. It had previously been the source of a breach in November, when the Twitter accounts of Xbox, PlayStation, government officials and others were hacked.
“We are aware of the situation and have started an investigation into the matter," Omer Ginor, the CEO of the company, said. Twitter Counter had been "95 percent certain" it had patched the November glitch. Even though they reopened their service, they couldn’t be sure a hacker still didn’t have access, "lurking in the shadows," he said.

=== Title: How to Have Your Best-Ever Trip to Europe This Summer - Bloomberg ===

Across Europe, spring is finally in the air. The trees are blooming, the parks are springing back to life, and inbound summer fares are about to surge through the roof.
Fret not. If you’re still unsure about your summer vacation plans, here’s everything you’ll need to (very quickly) plan your best European jaunt yet, from the hottest, of-the-moment hotels to the destinations you might be overlooking.
The City of Light will twinkle even more brightly this July, when the lights officially flick back on at Rosewood’s 
. It took four years to update the 258-year-old palace hotel—located right on the Place de la Concorde—but the investment has paid off. An old ballroom in which Marie Antoinette used to practice piano has been converted into a grand suite; new apartment-style suites on the fourth floor will debut, with interiors by Karl Lagerfeld; and the new Bar Les Ambassadeurs will have the largest Champagne selection in town (no small feat in Paris). 
 Late July, after the Crillon gets its rhythm but before the city shuts down in August.
 Croissants at 
, right around the corner from your posh digs. To this writer’s estimation, they’re the best in the city.
 
It may not be in the EU much longer, but for now, it still counts. With the pound struggling post-Brexit, your money will go unusually far. Book into 
, a hotel of epic proportions in the City. It’s the brainchild of two Midas-like masterminds: Soho House and Sydell Group. (The latter birthed the cool-kid Freehand brand and New York’s Nomad hotel.) There’s also the 
, in a historic 1915 building that now has a wine program by Château Latour and a restaurant by French power chef Anne-Sophie Pic. 
 June, to avoid wet or overly hot weather.
 Scones and tea in the atrium of the 
, an under-the-radar museum in an immaculately preserved London townhouse.
 
Despite its rep for world-class architecture, this Spanish culture capital hasn’t always had much to offer in the way of great hotels. This summer it gets several impressive additions, with the 
 leading the pack. The first entry for this nascent five-star brand (a Vienna Almanac is up next, in early 2019), it’ll have 92 sumptuous rooms with deep window alcoves just a five-minute walk from the Plaza de Cataluña. 
 July, when the city comes to life with tons of open-to-the-public events, or August; the city doesn’t take Europe’s month-long siesta too seriously.
 A day trip to the beaches. It’s worth braving the crowds at Barceloneta beach to hit up 
, a chic interpretation of local 
 (beach bars) with slushy drinks, tropical fruit 
 (ice pops), and macaron ice cream sandwiches.
 
At least the Dorchester Collection’s 
 was. It has just reopened after a top-to-bottom redo. A reduction in rooms, from 121 to 98, means that the gilded accommodations (and marble bathrooms) are ultra-spacious; on the rooftop you’ll find a stunningly sophisticated restaurant with floor-to-ceiling windows that open up for an al fresco feel. That you’re around the corner from the Spanish Steps and Villa Borghese is icing on the (olive oil) cake. 
 June, before the summer crowds really swarm.
 The best pizza you’ve ever tasted awaits at 
, a third-generation operation 
 Campo de' Fiori. And then there’s dessert at the family’s new bakery down the block, 
, where you can get flaky, cone-shaped 
 filled to order.
 
There’s more to do, from prettier beaches to a vibrant old town and a stunning new hotel: 
, which just opened under the Design Hotels umbrella. Like everything else on this postcard-perfect island, the building is a series of sugar-white cubes. But inside are punchy pops of color: dining room chairs in cotton candy pink, lemon-colored throw pillows, plush pool lounges in navy blue, and turquoise Aegean views from every window. 
 There’s no bad time to go to Mykonos. But go in May if you’d rather see the island’s quieter side.
No trip to Greece is complete without a meal of grilled octopus under an olive tree-shaded pergola. Find it at 
, a beachside spot that’s refreshingly free of pretense on this otherwise-sceney island. 
 
The super-stylish team behind Paris’s Le Pigalle has just set up shop amid a string of tiny fishermen’s villages on the Provence coast, midway between St. Tropez and Cannes. Their 
 is an idyllic escape, with a saltwater swimming pool that’s cut into natural rock formations, an open-air cinema, and a pétanque court. As for the 50 rooms and suites: They’re all whitewashed with wicker and sand accents, most with either sea views or private gardens. 
 The region is at its buzziest in July and early August; if a quiet retreat is what you’re after, go in June or pre-Labor Day.
 The town of Saint-Raphaël, where Les Roches Rouges is based, lies at the foot of the Massif de l’Estére hiking trails. It’s worth spending a day amid the red rocks and mossy vegetation that seem to tumble right into the shore.
 
Go to Westeros in luxurious style by visiting two new properties on the island’s two prettiest beach towns. First is the just-redone 
 in Dubrovnik, all glitz and glam in a landmarked royal villa. And then there’s 
, a sweet gem of a property that’s brimming with design smarts. No boat required, but that doesn't mean you can't get on one for fun. 
 Avoid crowd by traveling in May or June.
 Walk Dubrovnik’s Old Town ramparts: You’ll see how the city’s picturesque terra cotta roofs edge all the way up to the coastline. (You might spy a few recognizable 
 landscapes while you’re at it.)
 
It’s 
, a Georgian pile in Devon that’s been lovingly converted into a 21-room hotel by the locally beloved chef, Michael Caines. On the expansive grounds, you’ll find 28 acres of gardens and parkland and a newly-planted vineyard, which Caines hopes will produce Champagne-style wines by 2021. Bonus: The Jurassic Coast beaches are just a few minutes down the road, as are the towns of Exmouth and Exeter. 
 The English countryside is beautiful all summer long.
 Bike along the eight-mile Exe Estuary trails, and you’ll see the idyllic towns and villages of Topsham, Exton, and Cockwood.
 
And you wouldn’t be doing it right if you stuck to the cities. Base yourself at the 
, the first European property for this venerable Asian brand. Aside from their impeccable hospitality standards, you’ll find built-in activities for the whole family. (There’s an Arnold Palmer-designed golf course, separate kids’ and teens’ clubs, an Ayurvedic spa, and six restaurants.) You’re also within easy reach of vineyards, beaches, and the pastel-colored town of Vilamoura. 
 July and August are the driest months; June offers tons of local festivals.
 Spot flamingos (and tons of other unusual birds, such as the purple swamphen) in the tidal flats at Ria Formosa Natural Park, a series of coastal lagoons and wetlands that stretch across 18,000 hectares.
 
Over in Lake Lucern, the 
—once a favorite of Sophia Loren, the Carters, and the Danish royals—will soon be reborn as a summertime paradise. Following a $545 million investment, it will serve as four separate hotels: a five-star, an inn, a wellness resort, and a boutique four-star option in a 1904 Belle Époque building. The latter, called the Palace Hotel, will be the first to open, in June, with 108 wood-lined rooms strewn with fur throws and brass fixtures. (Remember, four-star standards in Switzerland are five-star-worthy anywhere else.) 
 Later in the summer. The various hotels, 12 restaurants, spa, and golf course are all opening as they’re ready—and the Palace is just one piece of the puzzle.
 With a resort this sprawling, you’re not going anywhere. Stay put, and enjoy those epic lakeside sunsets.
 

=== Title: The Lamborghini Huracan Will Rip Apart Your Daily Driving - Bloomberg ===

The Lamborghini Huracan is a confusing beast.
Its base model costs $237,000. That’s considerable, to be sure, but it’s half the price of the Lamborghini Aventador.
It’s arguably the subtlest modern Lamborghini ever designed, especially when you consider the electro-’80s-style edges of the 
 and the multiple gaping vents of the 
. But its rib-cage-like back, exposed engine cavity, and spaceship profile remain the most extreme style elements on a production car today.
It’s touted as the “driver-friendly” Lamborghini, suitable for canvassing both town and country. Stephan Winkelmann from Lamborghini even told me it was “easy on the road.” That must be a relative term. Its excruciatingly low clearance, 14-mpg gas mileage, absentee cup holders, dangerous lack of visibility, and miniscule trunk—I hesitate to even label it as such—make it painful as a weekend conveyance. On the way out east last Sunday morning, I was sweating speed bumps 
 the gas gauge—all the while fending off the overflow tote I had to place at my feet.
Those last bits—the parts about low clearance, zero visibility, and that insatiable thirst for fuel—are nothing new. Heck, we 
 this sort of thing when we drive a Lamborghini. It’s part of the adventure.
Yet I would argue that at this point, Lamborghini has got to move at least a hair’s width past that old model. I know it’s painful. But it can’t get away with those sorts of annoyances anymore. No longer is Lambo the esteemed family-run Italian house making dozens of cars a year for connoisseurs and enthusiasts who delight in indulging their inner automotive masochist, as it was in the 1970s. It’s part of Volkswagen, making thousands of cars a year, largely in Germany, for everyone from Kanye West to second-string power forwards in L.A.
None of this means the Huracan is a bad car. (Well, it 
 bad in the best sort of naughty way. It’s fun to use to blow past people on the highway, and it gets a lot of attention on the street.) But it does all mean that this bull is a mixed breed of Italian heritage forced to contend with conflicting demands from a neo-luxury, ultra-global market.
If you decide to buy a Huracan, go in with both eyes open, as it were. If you don’t, you’re going to get burned.
Priority No. 1: You must focus when you drive this car. The Huracan deserves it. It’s too powerful and fast and special—unlike the slick McLaren 650S, it has real personality—to treat casually. This car is born of track monsters, an animal built around a 602-horsepower direct-injection 5.2-liter V10 engine that can reach 200 mph on a casual afternoon jaunt.
Aside from the matter of the ulcer-inducing lack of clearance—there’s a button that raises the chassis as a sort of buffer over abrupt inclines, which does help—the Huracan eats asphalt at the speed of the national debt. It’ll go zero to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds, which well beats the $176,000 Porsche 911 GT3 RS and the $200,000 Ferrari California. (It basically equals the $245,000 Ferrari 458 Italia, but it does not come near the blistering and $845,000-plus Porsche 918 Spyder.)
I first drove this car when I worked for 
 almost a year ago. At the time, I didn’t get to drive it on the track—so this time, up at Lime Rock racetrack near Sharon, Conn., I made sure to floor it, literally. You will, too, when you drive this. It’s impossible to resist the urge. When you accelerate, the thrust pushes you back as if you’re passing through a force field into some sort of other dimension. Though, for my money there are other cars—like that McLaren 650S—that just 
 a shade quicker as you push them to the edge.
The Huracan also contains Lamborghini’s first-ever attempt at a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, with four-wheel drive to boot. The gear modes include the “manual” Strada or the automatic Corsa. In both, the transmission operates unobtrusively and willingly—if not with quite as much élan as you might find in a Bentley Continental Coupe. There is a blissful lack of turbo lag, of any hesitancy whatsoever, when you punch the gas.
The Huracan is made from aluminum, with carbon-fiber components in the bulkhead, center tunnel, and B-pillars, which accounts for a 10 percent weight loss over the Gallardo. That means it’s better—lighter—around corners than predecessors. As I wound up Route 22 on the way to Lime Rock Park, it felt less like a brick and more like a very insistent pit bull. Thick but pliable if you get it pointed in the right direction and keep a firm hand on the collar (read: steering wheel). It’s about as wide in the shoulders as a pit bull, too.
Accelerating in a straight line means tightening your stomach muscles as you feel the small of your back flatten against the seat. The subtle hum of the engine—hidden behind the top note of its roar—as the car launched under me confirmed that I had just achieved liftoff.
Here is how it’s different from others in its price range: The best, fastest, most elegant Bentleys, Ferraris, Rolls-Royces 
 to help you when you drive. They aspire to conspire with you. The Huracan feels reptilian in comparison. It has power. It has edge. But it’s no easy breezy driver (see reasons stated above); it’s certainly not interested in developing any sort of mutually beneficial relationship.
The Huracan is going to do what nature and its reptilian brain decree. You, as driver, are accessory to that instinct. Don’t get it twisted.
About that visibility. The windshield is so narrow and slanted I had to crane my neck down any time I wanted to see if the stoplight in front of me had turned green yet. And you might as well remove the rearview mirror and give it back to the dealer before you drive off the lot. I couldn’t see a thing with it back there as I drove upstate, no matter how many times I adjusted it. On the Huracan, side mirrors are your friends.
(Along my drive to Connecticut, I stopped by the garage of a well-known auto racing champion. His longtime mechanic, a white-haired man with his own impressive array of ’70s-era drag racing credentials, told me he could see the visibility problems from the moment I pulled in the drive: “That’s a beautiful car,” he said, leaning toward me conspiratorially. “Beautiful and useless.”)
But yes, beautiful. I love how the Huracan looks. It tells everyone that it’s crazy and intimidating and fast and mean—and it doesn’t have to use a single word to convey that message. No, you won’t get those suicide doors that swoop up like they do on the Aventador, but you do get those sick vents along the rear roof, and the low-slung swagger of a race car. It sounds strange to say, but everything else is minimal. And rightfully so. The audacity of those lines alone demands enough attention, emotionally. This is the kind of car you feel you could sketch in about three lines.
The interior is unusual; all of the buttons are grouped in a row across the center console, like a rocket ship, and the start button sits hidden under a fire-engine red flip-top cage. There’s a whole process to engaging the parking brake—but it all fits with the overall character of the car. Other oddities: The turn signal is a single button that you push with your thumb and have to manually turn off half the time, too, as it’s not very sensitive. The gauges are all electronic, rather than “real” analog; the slim, disappearing door handles flip open when you push the unlock button; and the heated sport seats ($2,800 extra if you want them) are firm enough to make you sore after a day on the track.
And, as I mentioned, the trunk is basically an offense to anyone who believes in traveling with more than one pair of shoes.
So, the car is by far the most versatile model Lamborghini makes. It’s a real weirdo. But you knew that. And as Billy Joel sings, “It just may be a lunatic you’re looking for.”

=== Title: A Jaguar XK 120 Is a Good Investment for Vintage Car Lovers - Bloomberg ===

The Jaguar XK 120 is the perfect example of what a prototype should do.
Jag launched it in 1948 at the London Motor Show as a way to test out a new engine and gauge interest in a new body design. It intended the car to facilitate the evolution of the brand.
“The real reason for the XK 120 was survival,” said Fred Hammond, Jaguar’s Head of Heritage. Because William Lyons, the brand's founder, saw the future of the company as based on sedans, the idea was to build a sedan with a race car engine so as to best appeal to consumers. 
Lyons didn’t expect to sell many of his novel XKs—they were mainly being used to test engine components and body composition for that potential future sedan—so he made them with readily available, lightweight aluminum. (The conventional method for making car bodies back then used steel, which was scarce after World War II; aluminum was considered flimsy.) Demand for the XK 120 exploded, especially in the United States, where drivers had never seen a postwar sports car.   
“Don’t forget a lot of the cars that were in the marketplace were leftovers from before the war,” said Hammond. “The XK 120 was considered to be a fabulous value for the money. It felt much more modern than anything else people had driven, especially for the American driver. They had only the ponderous cars from the '30s, and those were put back into production with no updates right after the war. The feel of the sports car was so new to them.”
Early models came with a straight-six, 160-bhp “XK” engine and a feline body molded out of the aluminum and trimmed in ash wood. It was Jag’s first sports car in nearly a decade, so there was a lot of pressure to hit on something that would stick. Preliminary results were exceptional: The car 
, and Jaguar ended up using that engine until the 1980s. Movie star Clark Gable owned several of the first models; they have since been in many movies, including 
and 
Since then, the XK 120 has survived well in auction and private sales. Earlier this month, an exceptional 
 took $8,091,216 at the Bonhams auction in Monaco; the wildly successful racer had remained virtually unchanged from its original form. RM Sotheby’s recently sold a 
 for just over $287,000. Dozens are listed on 
 for $100,000 and more. Not a bad return, considering the original XK 120s cost roughly £1,000 ($1,470) at their debut.
Hagerty data shows values increasing steadily over the past five years, with the average sale price of XK 120s made from 1948 to 1954 rising from $85,000 in 2011 to $97,000 this year. The rise has followed that of the general auction market.
“From a value standpoint, in recent times they have climbed quite a bit,” said Jonathan Klinger, a spokesman for Hagerty, noting that they’re easier to procure than other six- and seven-figure historic cars. “Their values were going up significantly, and they recently became six-figure cars, so a lot of the restored cars have come to the market at once.” In other words, once the cars hit six-figures, it became worth it for those owners to sell them.
Klinger said the strong increase may level slightly in the next couple years, which reflects the overall market, but will remain on a high plateau, like similar-era models from Ferrari and Maserati.
The difference between those slightly more famous cars and the Jaguar XK 120s is that while hard-to-find Ferraris and Maseratis command an additional tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars, the more prevalent XKs cost less and remain reliable as casual drivers. That's not to say they're ubiquitous—not by a long shot. Jaguar made 12,078 XK 120s from 1948 to 1954; by comparison, it made more than 76,000 E-Types, its most iconic car.
“The Jaguar is really nipping on their heels in terms of the price point,” Hammond said. “They are reliable to drive, and many of the best are in North America. In England a lot of cars from that era just didn’t last. England is an island surrounded by salt water. The climate isn’t conducive to preserving cars.”
If you ask most buyers, they’ll say they bought the car for passion rather than to make money. Granted, few collectors of beautiful objects, whether Picassos or Patek Philippes, admit to buying for purely investment purposes. But in this case, it might be relatively true.
Who can blame them? The model’s name comes from the 120-mile per hour top speed Jaguar promised, which at the time made it the fastest production car in the world. Zero to 60mph took 10 seconds, aided by that lightweight frame. By 1951, XK roadsters with their revolutionary engines and four-speed manual transmissions were averaging more than 100mph for 24 hours on special, banked tracks across Europe.
The first 242 XK 120s made had wood-framed open-top aluminum bodies with two seats; Perceiving the design line from the front wheels, over the hood, and to the rear was like watching a rolling wave: smooth, calm, powerful.
Production switched to all-steel construction—better for making the cars in volume—by 1950. It eventually came in three versions: as an open two-seat roadster (OTS) and later, as a “fixed-head” coupe (FHC) in 1951 and a drop-head coupe (DHC) in 1953. (The detachable canvas top and sidescreens were stowed behind the two seats.) The DHC and FHC versions are generally more luxurious than the OTS ones—they even had wind-up windows and wooden veneers on the dashboard and doors—but all had the sleek 
 doors with no external handles, a style named after the famous little Italian roadster that looked like a little boat. Driver and passenger had to pull an interior cord to open the door.
“The XK 120s are more desirable [than the later-model XK 140s and 150s], especially the ones designed before 1950 because those had aluminum skins,” Hammond said. “Any of the open cars command more money than the coupe.”
The design has undoubtedly influenced Jaguar’s aesthetic, even today: The 
 from hood to back, for instance, echoes the one along the XK 120. And you can see aspects of the 120's tall front grill even in models issued as late as 1990s-era S-Types.
“They set the design direction for postwar cars,” Klinger said.
How do you go about procuring one of these beauties? Carefully—and realistically. While they hold their value well, don’t expect them to jump radically in sale prices next year. Instead, this is a car you buy for a long-term love affair.
“Any of the original XK models are good,” Hammond said. "If you find one that is a good value, any one of those is a good investment." You can even take your car to Jaguar and have it 
 as authentic and in proper show and sell order. “Make sure the numbers match and the condition is pristine. Cars that the color has been changed on can be a little bit of an issue. As hot as the cars now are on the collectable market, getting a good one with its original form is the most important thing.”
Don’t buy one if you are tall. Even though they are reliable and sturdy as far as vintage cars go—this is the car you buy to drive in one of the many 
 
 worldwide—their non-adjustable seats and relatively short pedal beds make them better suited to a 5-foot, 10-inch driver than to a 6'4’’ driver.
In the documents describing the $8 million lot that Bonhams sold, racing star Stirling Moss praised the 3.4-liter XK engine for its “nice, smooth power” and “lovely noise,” but he also decried those seats: “I do remember how Jaguars never had good seats,” Moss said. “The XK120's weren't that good, and when the C-Type came along, they built racing seats which weren't much better."
Not that this detracts at all from the drive. These babies are considered thrilling behind the wheel.
“They’re excellent handling cars, especially the later ones,” Klinger said. “They sound great. They are plenty peppy enough. They handle well. They’re just fun.”

=== Title: Medtronic Computer Crash to Crimp Quarterly Sales, CFO Says - Bloomberg ===

A computer crash that shut down Medtronic Plc’s systems for global ordering, fulfillment and manufacturing for a week last month will crimp quarterly sales at the world’s largest medical technology company, Chief Financial Officer Karen Parkhill said.
Medtronic is still analyzing the issue, which was an internal infrastructure problem, Parkhill said in her first wide-ranging interview since joining Medtronic last summer. While the problem has been fixed and the company is back to its normal operations, it continues to fill back orders, she said.
The delays will push some sales into the next quarter. Medtronic is also dealing with a shortage of blood sugar sensors, partly because of higher-than-expected demand for an artificial pancreas the company has developed. Medtronic is scheduled to report results on Aug. 22.
“We do expect our first-quarter revenue growth on a constant currency basis to be within our guidance of 4 to 5 percent, but at the lower end of that range,” Parkhill said. First-quarter earnings per share should be in the upper end of the company’s high-single-digit range, thanks in part to a tax benefit expected in the quarter, she said.
The CFO said she’s confident that the company will meet its “full fiscal-year guidance of 4 to 5 percent constant-currency revenue growth, and 9 to 10 percent earnings-per-share growth.”
Medtronic stock fell 2.8 percent to $86.06 at 4:17 p.m. in New York, the biggest one-day loss since November. The shares are up 21 percent this year to date compared to a 17 percent gain in the 46-member Bloomberg Intelligence Global Medical Devices & Supplies index.
It’s not the only company to be hit by tech troubles. FedEx Corp. fell the most in two months after the company said its customers are 
 last month. Medtronic’s computer issue wasn’t a hack, as far as the company knows, but an internal issue.
Last month, Medtronic’s diabetes unit launched the first-ever artificial pancreas for type 1 diabetics. The device automatically monitors blood sugar and administers insulin without requiring constant testing and attention from the patient.
“While this no doubt throws a little dampener on the first quarter, the company’s reiteration of 4 percent to 5 percent organic for FY18 should provide some solace,” said Vijay Kumar, an analyst at Evercore ISI in New York. “Once you get the supply back, the numbers are going to go up. No one wants to see numbers come down because of a computer glitch, but this is a fairly decent outcome.”
Parkhill’s 10-year-old daughter was diagnosed with diabetes four years ago, which helped introduce her to the company’s efforts before she was in talks about the CFO role. Her daughter was one of the earliest and youngest users of the device, which Medtronic sells as the 670G.
“We couldn’t be more thrilled with the technology,” Parkhill said. “Her blood sugars are in better control now than they have been in the four years since she has been diagnosed.”
Demand for the company’s insulin pumps, glucose monitors and other supplies drove Medtronic to the top spot among diabetes device companies this year, said Jason McGorman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, displacing Roche Holding AG and Johnson & Johnson. The gap is poised to widen as more patients get the 
, which is about two years ahead of the competition, he said.
Parkhill, the daughter of an orthopedic surgeon and a nurse, was CFO of the bank Comerica Inc. before joining Medtronic, after putting in almost two decades at JPMorgan Chase & Co., where she began as an investment banker and left as CFO of commercial banking.
Medtronic continues to pay down debt it took on with the 2015 
 of Coviden Plc for $52.6 billion. It will use the bulk of the $6.1 billion in cash it gets from the planned sale of a medical supplies unit to Cardinal Health Inc. to further reduce its outstanding debt.
Parkhill said the company will do the same with foreign cash that may be freed up as part of a resolution of a legal case with the Internal Revenue Service about its Puerto Rico operations that is currently winding through the courts. The original ruling, now being appealed by the IRS, would have made $3 billion available to the company that it has earmarked for debt, she said.
Medtronic is on track to generate $850 million in cost savings from its acquisition of Covidien in 2015, though the effort won’t stop once that goal is reached, Parkhill said. The company, which has a legal address in Dublin and operating headquarters in Minneapolis, can also become more efficient, Parkhill said. She pointed to manufacturing, human resources, finance and legal operations, sourcing and systems integration as areas for improvement.
“Clearly we continue to focus on delivering a far greater bottom line than a top line, and you need margin improvement to do that,” she said. “This quarter is no exception.”

=== Title: ICO Market Is Probably Full of Fraud, U.S.'s Top Financial Cop Warns - Bloomberg ===

Wall Street’s top regulator has a warning for mom-and-pop investors who are rushing into the booming market for initial coin offerings: the space is probably full of fraud.
“It would shock me if you don’t see pump-and-dump schemes in the initial coin offering space,” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton said Thursday in Washington. “This is an area where I’m concerned about what’s going to happen to retail investors,” he added.
Clayton’s comments show the regulator is worried that crooks are harnessing technology to pull off a scam that’s about as old as markets themselves: talking up an asset and then selling out at an inflated price once the dumb money pours in.
The SEC has stepped up scrutiny of ICOs, which startups have used to raise more than $2 billion this year, according to analysts at Autonomous Research LLC. The offerings allow investors to fund companies, often receiving digital tokens in return.
The regulator is among authorities tasked with keeping investors from getting fleeced as ICO fever sweeps the globe. In July, the SEC cautioned the industry that in many instances, the offerings are essentially securities that must be registered with the agency.
While expressing concern about fraud in the initial coin market, Clayton did say there was likely “a fair amount of value” in the underlying technology for functions like accounting and record keeping.
China’s central bank banned ICOs earlier this month and called for a halt to trading on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.

=== Title: Overwater Bungalows in the Caribbean: Mexico, Jamaica, Panama - Bloomberg ===

It used to be that you had to traverse the Indian or South Pacific ocean to sleep in a thatched-roof, overwater bungalow—the epitome of luxury accommodations. With ladders that descend straight into turquoise waters, four-poster beds with gauzy mosquito netting, and private plunge pools, they’re the stuff of honeymoon dreams. (Never mind what they’ll do for your 
.) 
Now you can get the floating villa experience beyond jetting to Bora Bora, Fiji, and Thailand. A trio of resorts is introducing the concept in Mexico, Jamaica, and Panama—where growing demand for luxury has made overwater bungalows a no-brainer for hoteliers.
The first to open its doors will be the 
, in the Riviera Maya, with 30 villas that hover over the Caribbean Sea. They’re still under construction, with bookings being snapped up for Sept. 1 and beyond.
Interestingly, the owners say they weren’t inspired by iconic, award-winning properties such as the 
 or Indonesia’s 
; instead, they say they took a page from the ancestral Aztec community, who built their homes over Tenochtitlan’s lake. For guests, the 800-square-foot bungalows will be more reminiscent of the five-star resorts they’ve seen online: They have custom furnishings made of local Zapote wood and Mexican white granite, thatched palapa-style roofs, outdoor showers, and glass floor panels (so you can spot blue-green pompano fish and silvery sea bream without leaving your room).
Naturally, they’ll also come with butlers. At $665 per night, they’re priced on an all-inclusive basis, including premium booze and 24-hour room service.
But the Palafitos aren’t the only bungalows opening in the Western Hemisphere. Also coming up soon are a collection of five overwater villas at the 
, which are slated to open in mid-November and are nearly sold out until September 2017. They’ll have floating decks that double as living rooms, his and hers vanities, and hammocks that suspend over the sea.
It may be Sandals, but these bungalows aren’t a value proposition. Whereas the property’s so-called Luxury Level rooms go for $188, the “Over the Water Private Island Butler Villa with Infinity Pool” category will run a cool $1,435 per night per person, which is consistent with what you’d pay at Cambodia’s 
, arguably one of the best hotels in the world.
For what looks to be the most upscale of the Caribbean’s overwater openings, you’ll have to wait until 2019. That’s when Viceroy will make a splash in 
, the backpacker haven that’s suddenly drawing in-the-know luxury hounds. Expect 186 guest rooms and 42 overwater bungalows that branch out over the Caribbean. The catch? It’ll only be accessible by boat.

=== Title: New Cyberattack Goes Global, Hits WPP, Rosneft, Maersk - Bloomberg ===

A new cyberattack similar to WannaCry is spreading from Europe to the U.S. and South America, hitting port operators in New York, Rotterdam and Argentina, disrupting government systems in Kiev, and disabling operations at companies including 
, advertiser 
 and the Chernobyl nuclear facility.
More than 80 companies in Russia and Ukraine were initially affected by the Petya virus that disabled computers Tuesday and told users to pay $300 in cryptocurrency to unlock them, Moscow-based cybersecurity company Group-IB said. About 
 have been attacked so far, according to Kaspersky Lab analysts, with organizations in Russia and the Ukraine the most affected.
Rob Wainwright, executive director at Europol, said the agency is "urgently responding" to reports of the new cyber attack. In a separate statement, Europol said it’s in talks with "member states and key industry partners to establish the full nature of this attack at this time."
Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, Russia’s largest crude producer, said in a statement that it avoided “serious consequences” from the “hacker attack” by switching to “a backup system for managing production processes.”
U.K. media company 
’s website is down, and employees have been told to turn off their computers and not use WiFi, according to a person familiar with the matter. Sea Containers, the London building that houses WPP and agencies including Ogilvy & Mather, has been shut down, another person said. “IT systems in several WPP companies have been affected,” the company said in emailed statement.
“With there being no global kill switch for this one, we’ll continue to see the numbers rise in different parts of the world as more vulnerable systems become more exposed,” said Beau Woods, deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council in Washington. Most vulnerable are places “where the operators are a lot of the times at the mercy of manufacturers and providers of those technologies and there’s a long time between existence of a fix and implementation of a fix.”
The hack quickly spread from Russia and the Ukraine, through Europe and into the U.S. 
, operator of the world’s largest container line, said its customers can’t use online booking tools and its internal systems are down. The attack is affecting multiple sites and units, which include a major port operator and an oil and gas producer, spokeswoman Concepcion Boo Arias said by phone.
, owned by Maersk, is experiencing system issues at multiple terminals, including the Port of New York and New Jersey, the largest port on the U.S. East Coast, and Rotterdam in The Netherlands, Europe’s largest harbor. APM Terminals at the Port of New York and New Jersey will be closed for the rest of the day “due to the extent of the system impact,” the 
Cie de Saint-Gobain, a French manufacturer, said its systems had also been infected, though a spokeswoman declined to elaborate, and the French national railway system, the SNCF, was also affected, according to Le Parisien. 
 said it was also experiencing a global IT outage and was looking into the cause. 
 based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, reported that its computer network was compromised due to the hack.
Port operators at grain terminals in Rosario, Argentina also reported the attack affected operations, including halting some deliveries, beginning Tuesday morning, according to Guillermo Wade, manager of the Rosario port and maritime chamber.
The strikes follow the global 
 involving the WannaCry virus that affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries as extortionists demanded $300 in bitcoin from victims. Ransomware attacks have been soaring and the number of such incidents increased by 50 percent in 2016, according to 
 
Analysts at Symantec Corp., have said the new virus, called Petya, uses an exploit called EternalBlue to spread, much like WannaCry. EternalBlue works on vulnerabilities in Microsoft Corp.’s Windows operating system.
The new virus has a fake Microsoft digital signature appended to it and the attack is 
 to many countries, Costin Raiu, director of the global research and analysis team at Moscow-based 
, said on Twitter.
The attack has hit Ukraine particularly hard. The intrusion is “the biggest in Ukraine’s history,” Anton Gerashchenko, an aide to the Interior Ministry, wrote on Facebook. The goal was “the destabilization of the economic situation and in the civic consciousness of Ukraine,” though it was “disguised as an extortion attempt,” he said.
 
, a Ukrainian utility, switched off all computers after the hack, while another power company, 
, was also affected, though “not seriously,” the Interfax news service reported.
Ukrainian delivery network Nova Poshta halted service to clients after its network was infected, the company said on Facebook. Ukraine’s Central Bank warned on its website that several banks had been targeted by hackers.

=== Title: Vintage Nissan Skyline GT-R Hakosuka and Kenmeri - Bloomberg ===

At the 
 in March, Nissan introduced its 
 by unveiling it among five older variations on the model.
The vintage cars were Nissan Skylines, from the early 1970s all the way through 2001. The Skyline was the grandfather of the original GT-R line that had garnered Nissan massive racing and video-game notoriety. Two in particular caught 
 from bystanders: A 1971 Nissan Skyline 2000GT-R “Hakosuka” and a 1973 Nissan Skyline 2000GT-R “Kenmeri.”
Those embody a particular 2000GT-R style that evokes the best vintage Nissans ever produced. The version first released in February 1969 had a 1,989cc DOHC 24-valve inline 6-cylinder engine that hit 158 horsepower and 130 pound-feet of torque at 5,600 rpn. It also came with the famous Nissan S20 powerplant that later appeared in the Fairlady Z432, a model with the same body as the 240Z but never offered in America.
The basic Skyline series started with the Prince Motor Company in 1955 but went to Nissan after the companies merged in 1966. This iconic third-generation version, called the C10 Skyline 2000GT-R, was marketed by Nissan after the merger.
Skyline 2000GT-Rs first came out as five-speed manual sedans but quickly morphed into coupe form—all the better for the race track. Nissan stripped that version of unnecessary equipment so that it would be superlight and nimble (but thankfully it kept those handsome analogue dials and cool wooden interior accents). It worked: The racing version of the Skyline won more than 50 times from 1969 to 1972, which fanned enthusiasts’ obsession with the car. The model was never exported to the U.S. (Original Skyline 2000GT-Rs from the early ’70s are so rare on the collector market in the U.S. that Hagerty Insurance, which specializes in vintage cars, doesn’t compile figures yet for the brand.) 
But massive racing wins and a reputation for exacting prowess do much to cross international barriers. A discerning group of fans outside Japan has loved the old Skyline models because they are so entertaining to watch race—and to imagine driving.
“These were the hot cars, the early aspirational cars, from the video games,” said Jonathan Klinger, the head of communications for Hagerty. “If there is a vehicle that you can put as the poster child for the video-game obsession aspect, this car is that. And of course 
 has really made this the thing for millennials.”
 
Traditionally in the U.S., it has been exceedingly rare to see an early Skyline 2000GT-R on the auction block. But times are changing. From 2014 to 2015, Hagerty saw quote activity—people searching online for prices—increase 377 percent for the Skyline 2000GT-R, “a bigger increase than I’ve ever seen before,” Klinger said. Even more interesting: 80 percent of the vehicles quoted were searched by millennials, 
 as those buyers age, and acquire more wealth, over the next decades.
Here’s why: It’s illegal to import to the U.S. any types of Skyline that are less than 25 years old. They have to wait till that age to be grandfathered in to federal emissions standards as historic vehicles. And as the popular R32 version from the late ’80s is just becoming available and sought-after on the auction block, it will foster interest further down the line in the earlier models, according to Klinger.
“Until very recently, you almost never saw those cars here in the States, but you’ll probably see them more in the next couple years,” Klinger said. “There has been some pent-up demand. And the popularity of the newer generations is going to continue to bring more interest to the original ones.”
 
If you want to buy a “Hakosuka” (“hako” means box, “suka” is the Japanese pronunciation of the "Sk" in Skyline) or a “Kenmeri” (nicknamed for an ad campaign featuring a young American-style couple named Ken and Mary, a spokesman for Nissan said) in the ultimate condition, be prepared to pay six figures. Nissan made only 832 Hakosuka sedans and 1,197 of the Hakosuka 2-doors, and of the few hundred known to be remaining, the ones in good condition rightly cost thousands of dollars. The marque made even fewer of the rare Kenmeri version; production was halted after only 197 units when stricter emission regulations were introduced shortly after their debut.
The two models “have progenitor status and rarity and will be of interest as awareness of these cars becomes more mainstream,” Klinger said, adding that if you want to buy them as a long-term investment, you’re probably on to something. “Although they aren't likely to provide significant returns in the next 12 to 18 months,” he added.
RM Sotheby’s sold a 1973 Nissan Skyline 2000GT-R in Monterey last year for $176,000. 
 had run $125,000–$175,000.) It also sold an even better example in 2014 
.
If you can settle for one with some obvious wear or heavy modifications—especially if it has lost that very special S20 engine—you can halve its cost. The DuPont Registry, for example, lists a 
 with just 3,107 miles for $50,000.
Or go to Japan, were prices run the gamut, from high-end options such as a 
 for $205,000 to the more affordable 
 listed for $41,500 and 
 for $55,000. It will cost only a few thousand dollars extra to 
, so it might be worth the effort to just go over and get one there.
Any way you look at it, you’ll spend much less on a Skyline than you would on the premier original Asian sports car, the 
.
“Other than the Toyota 2000GT, this would be the next aspirational Japanese car,” Klinger said. “You have the 240 Nissan Z, but those were very attainable and affordable and sold in the U.S., so they did not have the same unattainable factor that the Skyline does.”
The key is to be patient. Buy one now, if you can find a good example. Then wait a few years. Your prescience will pay off.

=== Title: Aboard Regent Seven Seas Explorer, an Ultra-Luxury Cruise Ship - Bloomberg ===

On board the opulent new 
 this week, Frank Del Rio, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, took a moment to talk about the subject of conspicuous consumption.
"This idea that one-percenters are the evil empire of the world is over," Del Rio said. "It's time to celebrate success. It's time to celebrate wealth. This ship is a trophy to the one-percenters."
 is a $450 million, 750-passenger, all-suite triumph of luxury—the first new ship for NCLH's high-end 
 brand in 13 years. It’s designed to make a splash, as well as a profit: Extravagance was always core to the plan when it was being conceived, and subtlety was never a consideration. Del Rio's simple goal was to create the most luxurious cruise liner ever built.
On a pre-inaugural cruise in the Western Mediterranean for media, travel agents, and company insiders, I had the run of the ship for five days. The most striking feature of this Italian-built, 55,254-ton ship is how palatial it feels.
Ceilings seem to soar endlessly, the floors are done up in intricate stone patterns (sometimes with gold leaf accents), and even the guest hallways have Czech crystal and glass chandeliers. There's an entire football field’s worth of marble onboard, half of it Carrara. The overall look is more Grand European Hotel than your typical cruise ship. 
Three design firms worked on the project, but somehow their work flows seamlessly. They report that "no" was a word rarely heard from the money guys.
Asked the craziest thing he got away with, Greg Walton of design firm 
 cited a $500,000, three-ton sculpture made from hand-cast bronze that resides outside the ship's Pacific Rim restaurant. It’s so heavy, it required steel reinforcement.
"The answer from Frank [Del Rio] was a resounding 'yes,' no matter what it weighed or what it cost when he saw the design," Walton said.
Del Rio himself was responsible for choosing (and even hanging) much of the art, and his refined taste comes through, clear as day. In the lobby are dramatic abstract paintings by Eduardo Arranz-Bravo, the famed Spanish artist, that were commissioned for the ship. And from the bar in front of Prime 7 steakhouse, you can spot pieces by Chagall and Picasso.
Up in the 
's top, $10,000-per-night Regent Suite, which occupies much of Deck 14, travel agent Bob Newman was wide-eyed and smiling so hard he could hardly talk.
"It's fabulous," said Newman, a vice president for Rhode Island-based Cruise Brothers. "Nothing compares to this. It's just unique. That's the only word I can use for it."
Explorer has 375 suites in 10 categories, all with marble bathrooms and oversized balconies—a key differentiator from its competition. On similar ships by Silversea, a luxury cruise line, everyone gets a butler; only select suites on the 
 get that perk. But everyone gets Veuve Cliquot or Jacquart Champagne and L’Occitane bath amenities, plush bedding, and furnishings, with the quality and perks increasing the higher the suite level.
The apex is the two-bedroom, 4,433-square-foot Regent Suite—the largest suite at sea—which comes with a limousine and driver so you don’t have to give up the VIP lifestyle in port. In the master bedroom, you can rest your head on a $90,000 
 that cost an additional $60,000 to install. There’s a one-of-a-kind, $250,000 Steinway Arabesque piano designed by Dakota Jackson in the living room. There’s also a private spa with sauna, steam shower, and an oversized, ocean-view hot tub—complete with unlimited treatments from the ship's 
. Even the heavy black-lacquer double door to the suite's marble entrance hall is designed to impress; it’s flanked by a pair of his and hers Picasso lithographs.
 
The eight restaurants aboard the Explorer boast a wide array of Champagnes; the ownership estimates 1,000 bottles will be consumed each week. And though you'll have to pay a premium for the best of the bubbles (Louis Roederer "Cristal Rosé" 2007 champagne goes for $525; a Château Margaux 1er Cru Classé 2007 was $1,150), many more treats come complimentary. At breakfast, there’s a self-serve caviar station with Siberian Osetra, blinis, and all the accoutrements your heart could desire. (Pro tip: You could also use a hearty spoonful to top your three-egg omelet).
At dinner in Compass Rose, the ship’s flagship restaurant, you can order from the chef’s daily-changing, European-inspired menu or get healthy offerings designed by Canyon Ranch. It's not quite as progressive as the molecular gastronomy-style restaurants aboard the larger Crystal Cruise ships, but the menus are full of crowd-pleasing items. If you like, you can order Maine lobster every night. (It's a safer bet than ordering steak, which didn't always arrive at the temperature requested.)
You can also put in a special request. As long as you give the chefs 24-hours notice, they’ll make any recipe you give them—even your mom's lasagna, if that's what you’re craving. It may taste just like home, but when it’s served on Versace chargers, it’ll feel a wee bit fancier.
At one point, Del Rio bragged that his top chefs—many of whom were recruited from France—are paid more than the ship's captain. “We have to pay top dollar to recruit top talent," he said. They might be talented indeed, but they're not Thomas Keller (who recently struck a partnership to design menus for Seabourn, one of Regent's competitors).
Regent stands out in the luxury market by including almost everything you can think of in its cruise fares: flights, pre-cruise nights at luxury hotels, several options for shore excursions in each port, Wi-Fi, premium drinks, gratuities, and more. All those inclusions make it the most expensive of the luxury cruise brands—and a favorite with travel agents, who happily get commissions on all of the above.
On the 
, that translates to a price point of about $1,000 per person per night, which varies slightly 
 The most affordable itineraries available are for March 2017, when you can get on a 10-night Caribbean cruise departing from Miami for an entry-level price of $5,499.
"We really wanted to set a new standard, to take it to the next level with Explorer," said Jason Montague, president and chief operating officer of the Prestige division of NCLH.
Clearly, the public is responding. The 
 is selling well—including the $10,000-per-night suite, which is all but sold out this year and already booked for more than half of next year.
"It's selling too easy," Del Rio said gleefully. "I quite frankly believe we'll be raising the price."
As for Regent having the world's most luxurious ship, Richard Meadows, president of rival Seabourn, said it wasn't a major concern to him or his brand.
"I think what's great about our industry is the consumer has choices and it is ultimately up to them to decide what is their definition of the perfect vacation."
But Regent has thrown down the gauntlet, and Meadows is ready to respond. He said the Adam Tihany-designed 
, previewing in December, would be "the most beautiful ship ever built" and offer exceptional service.
"It's the sum of all the parts," Meadows said. "When you see the finished product on 
, you are going to be blown away."

=== Title: Vintage Porsches Are Rising as the Next Blue Chip Classic Cars - Bloomberg ===

Earlier this month 
, Bonhams sold a 1955 
 for $1.34 million. The sum was about this year’s average for the iconic coupe, which amassed considerable value since similar models started
 back in 2012. 
But prices, while sure to stay stellar for the next several years, won’t continue their exponential rise indefinitely. So the real question is, what’s next?
If you ask the number crunchers, they say it’s Porsche. Recently in New York, a 1973 Porsche Carrera RS 2.7 Touring sold for 
.
“Of all of the people who sold a [classic] SL this year, 50 percent of them turned around and bought a Porsche,” said McKeel Hagerty, the CEO of Hagerty, an insurer of vintage automobiles. “Of that group, half bought a 911, and half bought a 
. I don’t think that’s a coincidence.”
Of course, the other 50 percent of those guys bought another Mercedes, a Ferrari, or a Jaguar, to varying degrees. And Ferrari still dominates the classic market; seven of the 10 highest North American sale prices of 2015 belong to that Italian icon. (No. 1 was a 1956 Ferrari 290 MM Spider that sold for more than $28 million Dec. 10 in New York.) But it is significant that Porsche alone dominates the next-up cull.
Recent auction numbers indicate an uptick. Blue chip cars in general 
 from an average value of $600,000 in 2007 to $2.6 million today. (As with company stocks, “blue chip” autos are the most expensive and consistent in the field, like the above-mentioned Ferrari and Mercedes.) Vintage 
jumped an average value of $150,000 in 2007 to $625,000 today; Porsches in particular have gone from five- to six and seven digits in the same time frame, with even models as late as early 2000s’ Carrera GT’s hitting near the million-dollar mark on a model that used to be worth $300,000. 
“European sports cars in general have been on a real rise in the last couple of years,” said Gord Duff, the car specialist at RM Sotheby’s. “Ferraris lead the way and then you go to the next greatest European sports cars, which are Mercedes, and then you get to Porsches. If we are saying Mercedes have peaked, Porsches are the next best thing.” 
Hagerty data that combines public auction sales and private sales shows that the 1974-1977 Porsche 911 has increased the most in average sale price of any classic car this year, with a jump of 154 percent in value over 2014. That’s more than anything from Aston Martin, Ferrari, or Lamborghini. Auction houses offered 27 more Porsches this year at the 
 than they did last year, especially 930s and 911 SC models. (The 930 is a flat-6 engine that was the top of the 911 range during the late ’70s and ’80s.) Searches for Porsche make up 23.5 percent of all queries by collectors ages 30 to 50, according to Hagerty.
Here’s what’s likely pushing the Porsche passion: Guys who were 
.
“Guys in their 40s now had a poster of that car when they were 10 years old,” Duff said of the Porsche 911, “and now they’re out there finding them.”
In fact, 1980 and newer vehicles have the fastest growth rates of any models; North American classic car auction sales have reached a record $1.45 billion total in 2015, an 11-percent increase over 2014’s $1.31 billion. The growth was pushed by activity among collectors who added 17 percent more 1980s-and-newer vehicles to existing Hagerty insurance policies—versus a 2.3-percent increase for pre-1980s classics. 
What’s more, there are plenty of Porsches on the market now that have been owned by one person who bought it for $30,000 20 or 30 years ago and are now worth $150,000. It’s just too tempting not to sell. (Or not to buy, since the numbers seem to keep rising.)
"A new era of later model performance cars from instantly recognizable brands have irrefutably proven that the term 'collector car' is not synonymous with 'old car,'" Hagerty said. “Porsche is next.”
Porsches—especially the 911s made between 1970 and 1980 and the 356 Speedsters made in the 1960s—have growing appeal because of several factors. For one thing, they are reliable—more reliable than other vintage cars from the era (Jaguar, Aston, Ferrari, ahem). Their mechanically simple Volkswagen-approved engines run smoothly and easily, and their well-built components are easily sourced the world over. Many owners are able to drive their models on a weekly basis, which is more than can be said for most high-end collectables: The adage about how owning a classic car is like being in a dysfunctional relationship is often, painfully, true.
Secondly, Porsches from this era have a wide entry point for prospective buyers. If you’re savvy, you can find an old 911 in the five-figure range. Or you can find one for more than $1 million, if that’s more in your price range. The same goes for those little 356s.
“The fact is if you love Ferraris, you’re having to spend $100,000 or more just to have something with a Ferrari badge,” Duff said. “If you love Porsche and want to get into something that has that badge, you can get into a relatively good one for $30,000.”
It comes down to numbers—how many of a particular model Porsche produced that year. (The rarer the model the more it will cost.) It also comes down to quality. Sotheby’s can sell a 356 coupe in decent condition for $60,000 and also sell one that has been perfectly restored for $150,000.
And it comes down options. Things like a pristine paint job with the “right” colors on the interior (tan, buff, gold, silver, crème all qualify) and Rudge-brand wheels will boost the price of any given Porsche. (Those wheels are especially important: Their origins trace back to a British bicycle manufacturer in the 1860s; they are among the most highly prized of any accessories in the collector-car universe. A full set can add 
 to the value of a car.)
The trick to making a sound purchase is to do your research. Find out where the car originated, how many buyers it had, and what sorts of accidents and maintenance problems it incurred. (Warm climates unlikely to foster rust or salt-lined snowy streets are best; and the fewer the maintenance issues the better. A clean bill of no-collisions is a must.) Find out what garage restored it, too, and where. And it should go without saying that the lower the miles on the odometer the better.
Most importantly, know that even though these things pop on the auction block, the impetus for their success has always been passion. So don’t buy a Porsche only to cosset it away. It’s meant to be driven. 
“If a guy spends $500,000 on one, chances are he’s had a few of them already—and there’s a reason he keep buying them,” Duff said. “They’re just finally getting to be worth what they should have been worth a long time ago.” 

=== Title: Keanu Reeves Will Build a $78,000 Arch Motorcycle Just for You - Bloomberg ===

Don’t mistake Keanu Reeves for some nice-guy motorcycle dilettante.
He doesn’t care about your trendy Scrambler-riding blue jeans or your fashion-forward “motorcycle” jacket. And he definitely doesn’t want to ride your pretty little café racer.
He is, on the other hand, more than happy to talk with you about the 
 superbikes he makes with his longtime friend, Gard Hollinger, a revered designer in the motorcycle world. The $78,000 motorcycles are based on a prototype Hollinger made for Reeves years ago; each of the 2,032cc, V-twin-engine beasts are made to order in Hawthorne, Calif., an hour south of Los Angeles.
“Building that [first] bike is where we got to know each other,” Reeves said in July during an interview at their shop. Unlike most experienced riders who started riding from a very young age on dirt bikes, scooters, and Groms, Keanu learned to ride as an adult. But he has already logged tens of thousands of miles on the backs of Nortons, Suzukis, a 1974 BMW 750, a Kawasaki KZ 900, a 1984 Harley Shovelhead, and a Moto Guzzi racer—all from his own personal collection.
Reeves first approached Hollinger in 2007 with the request to modify his Harley with a “sissy bar”—the backrest you can attach on the rear seat of a motorcycle so your passenger can lean back. Hollinger refused. “That wasn’t really my thing,” he told me with a wry grin. That’s when they started talking about building a completely new bike that would look beautiful 
 cruise, a gleaming silver prototype with thick tires and a gas tank curved like the fender of a Bugatti.
When Hollinger finished the bike, Reeves loved it so much he wanted more. A lot more—some for himself, and some to share with friends. He wanted to start a motorcycle company.
“It was really riding the prototype that was the proof of the business concept, even though we didn’t know it,” Reeves said.
They never planned to start a company—he had commissioned the prototype just for laughs and long rides. But the bike was so fun, Reeves said, that he couldn’t get it out of his mind. That’s when he started bugging Hollinger to make more.
“It was this idea of a big V-twin, a long wheel base with modern grade suspension and the telemetry that Gard had designed and the ergonomics,” he said. “It was this package that I wanted from the first time riding that bike. I’d never ridden anything like that.”
Hollinger wasn’t convinced. His company, 
, already generated plenty of business; the former motocross racer had developed a cult following of riders who loved his ability to coax beauty and power out of raw metals.
But Reeves the A-list actor wasn’t used to hearing “no.” He asked Hollinger three more times—after long dinners and booze-filled nights brainstorming how good it could be—before winning him over.
“I told him, ‘OK, the reason we should do this is because the machine is amazing, and we’re going to die’ [anyway],” Reeves said, laughing. “Let’s make something.”
Hollinger finally agreed. He would design the bikes himself based on Reeves’s vision, and the actor would road test them. It took them three years between finishing the prototype and getting the final result to production. They called the company Arch because it "sounded good in the mouth," Reeves said: "Arches, doorways, bridges, beautiful, functional—it made me think of tunnels and bridges and connections and journey. It was the rider to the bike, the experience of riding a motorcycle, our relationship, the idea with connecting with the company and our client."
“The original bike was the result of Keanu expressing what he was hoping for in a motorcycle,” Hollinger said.
Practicality and extreme design are often mutually exclusive when it comes to expensive bikes (just look at the awkward angles of the extreme choppers that cruise up and down the 405 every weekend). But that is what Reeves wanted.
At least, that’s the official story for why two 40-somethings continue to spend countless hours and their own money building a brand. (Reeves declined to say how much, other than noting they have no outside investors.) But there’s a much simpler explanation: They’re searching for a feeling.
“It has to make you giggle when you ride it,” Hollinger says.
Arch has sold a handful KRGT-1s since 2014 (the guys won’t specify how many). Hollinger says he expects to make roughly 30 or slightly more a year—exclusivity is important.
The bikes are made of more than 200 individual parts, most of which he fabricates with a small team of workers in the Hawthorne shop. (Arch is possibly the first motorcycle brand to be completely assembled in L.A. since a company called Crocker made V-twins there in the 1930s.)
Each is bespoke to its owner, so speed and power specs are subject to change, but in general they weigh around 538 pounds and, at 121 hp, can cruise easily at 100 mph. With their six gears, scooped-out insides, ultralight carbon fiber wheels, and aluminum bodies, they’re heavier than, say, a 485-pound Ducati xDiavel S but much lighter than something like a 640-pound Harley-Davidson V-Rod. Their five-gallon gas tanks will take you 200 miles before a fill-up. Each requires a $15,000 deposit even before that $78,000 price tag.
“It’s a bike that’s really confident feeling going straight,” Reeves told me, rattling off engine specs and power calibrations like a true gear head. “Our bike has a lot of torque—115 pounds—so whenever you get on the throttle, you really feel the pull and push of the motorcycle. It can turn and handle.”
If you see an Arch motorcycle on the road, you’ll know it in a second. They’re rounded at the front, with a dip in the middle for the single seat before curving up again at the rear. (This is a lone-wolf bike, no passengers allowed.) They have a single LED headlight and low, short handlebars. The rear Michelin tire is fatter than the front but not so wide as to distract; their reflective aluminum rear cowling makes them unmistakable at night.
Similar to buying a custom suit, buying your own KRGT-1 requires multiple sessions of measurements—Hollinger fits the pedals, the handlebars, and the seat angle to your exact size. The proprietary Arch suspension is also adjustable according to riding style and preference. Once you settle on your model, delivery time takes 90 days or so—the Arch billet aluminum swing arm requires more than 17 hours of machining alone—though most of that time is spent working with outside vendors for finishes such as custom paint, engraving, and metal finishes to personalize the bike for the customer.
In actual work time it takes only a couple weeks to build the bike. Then Reeves takes it out for a test drive.
“It has to work,” he said, laughing. “After that it’s aesthetics and feel and taste. The bike started off as a classic American big V-twin, but because of the way it handles and the ergonomics and the telemetry that Gard has designed, I feel like it’s in a new class of motorcycle which might be called a ‘performance cruiser.’”
Whatever you call them—that term is a new one—they’ll keep even the most experienced rider occupied. The bikes are not fat and low like a hog, nor are they flat-seated for extra passengers like a café racer. For urban riding and highway cruising they hit the Goldilocks sweet spot: just right.
Better yet, they will hit 60 mph in the time it takes to read this sentence.
“We went for a ride yesterday for 400 miles,” Reeves said. “I’m still thinking, ‘Let’s go ride, let’s do that again.’”

=== Title: Best New Resorts in Caribbean: Bahamas, St. Barts, Anguilla, BVI - Bloomberg ===

With winter still flexing its muscles, a mass exodus is nigh—straight to any beach resort in the Caribbean with unclaimed lounge chairs. It is spring break season, after all. No matter what’s driving your need for a little vitamin D, here are the best new spots to hunker down with a piña colada, a good book, and not a single worry. 
Eleven Experience has 
off perfectly located, beautifully designed fly fishing and 
 that can be booked only exclusively, by one party at a time. So perhaps it’s no surprise that its first book-it-by-the-room beach resort feels like an intimate, 
 in the 
 of the world. Its 11 modern-colonial rooms are spread out across four small buildings: the 1800 house (named for the year it was built) and its annex, plus two two-suite cottages. Our favorite room? The Colebrook suite, for the best views of the Eleutheran Bay. 
 
The tiny triangular land mass of Shoal Bay has an outsize reputation for being one of the most startlingly pristine beaches in the world: all pearlescent sand and vividly turquoise waters. So this
 is enough to let it contend with British West Indies bigwigs such as 
 and 
. Its rooms are sparser by comparison with its competitors, with a simple but pretty whitewashed look. But they’re priced accordingly, at almost a third of Anguilla’s average five-star going rate.
 
A slew of new hotel openings and high-profile renovations are making 
 even more fabulous than it already was. There’s the whimsical 
, the sleek 
, and the fully refreshed 
. But only one is managing to convert loyal guests from the island’s toniest resorts, and that’s 
, a streamlined reimagining of the traditional plantation-style resort with 46 rooms designed by Paris-based Syllbie de Margerie. Expect Hermès bath amenities, catered beach picnics on undiscovered coves, white-glove service, and excellent croissants at breakfast. It’s as French as can French be. 
 
A $100 million investment has breathed new life into 
—and just in time to host the America’s Cup this June. (And yes, Bermuda isn’t technically in the Caribbean, but we’ll let this slide.) Beat the crowds, and you’ll find a new restaurant by Marcus Samuelsson that’s adorned with original pieces by Nelson Mandela and Andy Warhol, along with a swoon-worthy 
 and 170 fully redone rooms in pastel shades of blue. Speaking of pastels: The hotel’s palace-like exterior is still just a few shades brighter than the pink sands of Hamilton Harbour. 
 
It’s been more than a decade since Cayman’s Seven Mile Beach saw a new hotel, and 
—the company’s first international resort—was worth the wait. Corner suites have floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall windows on two sides; they make you feel as though you’re hovering over cerulean waters. The hammam in the 8,500-square-foot spa is lined with tiles that were flown in from Turkey. And restaurants range from a nine-seat chef’s counter to a grab-and-go pantry stocked with cookie dough (to bake in your bungalow’s kitchen). It’s a Kimpton, after all, so unbuttoned fun is the name of the game. 
 
If you’ve been to Turks & Caicos, you’ve probably stayed on bustling Grace Bay. Just 10 minutes away on the opposite side of this narrow island is the far more secluded Long Bay Beach, where the glamorous 
 recently opened with access to one of the world’s best kitesurfing spots and a treehouse kids’ club. Book in a central ocean-facing room on a higher floor, though, or don’t book at all: There’s still construction on site while the resort finishes its spa, and early reports point to noise concerns throughout other parts of the building—but we have high hopes knowing the management company behind it. 

=== Title: Hacks to Survive a 20-Hour Flight—Without a Laptop or Tablet - Bloomberg ===

On Monday night, travelers flying to the U.S. from eight Muslim-majority countries started receiving warnings that they’d need to pack all electronics larger than cell phones into checked luggage; that means no laptops, no tablets, and no cameras (among other things). By Tuesday, 
 with a similar (but more forgiving) policy.
Included on the do-not-fly-with-gadgets list are passengers heading directly to the U.S. from Abu Dhabi and Dubai; Amman, Jordan; Cairo; Casablanca, Morocco; Doha; Kuwait City; Istanbul; and hubs in Saudi Arabia.
The affected airlines? Egypt Air, Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways, Kuwait Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, and Turkish Airlines.
Given that a wide swath of passengers flying between the U.S. East Coast and Asia will connect in Dubai or Abu Dhabi—courtesy of powerhouse Gulf carriers 
 and 
, respectively—the ban has extreme implications. Both foreign visitors and U.S. citizens will see their entertainment options slim way down, along with their in-flight productivity. (Sorry, boss.) Since many business- and first-class passengers expect to work on these flights, which can range from 8 to 16 hours, the ban may 
 as fliers look to hubs in Europe when traveling through the region. (Some speculate this is 
.)
Few loyalists are likely to abandon the posh Gulf carriers, though; Etihad, Emirates, and 
 all have top-notch in-flight entertainment systems, with as many as 2,500 channels that include binge-worthy TV series, recent Oscar winners and nominees, and live sports and news streaming. Emirates even lets you connect to the onboard Wi-Fi system on your seat-back screen; the TV remote control has a full keyboard on the back, so you can easily manage your email. In business class on an A380, passengers can also 
 in the back of the top deck (which is soon to become a great networking spot!).
The smaller carriers are the ones that will suffer. How, for instance, will a nonstop flight on the no-frills, no-gadgets Royal Air Maroc compete with a slightly longer connecting route on plush, laptop-friendly Air France? Easy answer: It won’t.
If you’re a flier who needs to work during those long hours—or you just want to maintain control of your own entertainment—here are your options.
 
So you’ve already booked a ticket on a flight that’s electronically restricted? Here’s what to do.
 Buy a smart notebook—a pen-and-paper setup that will save your notes, memos, and doodles to the cloud. Both 
 and 
 offer good choices here.
 If you’re used to typing on an iPad or laptop keyboard, pick up a collapsible universal keyboard (like 
 or 
) that will pair with your phone, too. Even the largest phone is still on the small side for word processing, but it’ll do in a pinch—and apps such as Evernote and Google Keep will make it easy to seamlessly transfer your work to a larger device when you’re back on terra firma.
 
Averting boredom starts before you even leave for the airport. Check your carrier’s website to get a sense of its seat-back entertainment offerings, and figure out how many free hours you’ll likely have to fill—then choose your own adventure.
 Remember the tactile fulfillment you used to get out of thumbing through a great novel, feeling the paper weather under your fingertips as the book’s weight shifted from your left hand to your right? That’s still a thing.
Oh, and there’s a reason coloring books have made inroads with a grown-up audience. Detailed options like the 
 by Johanna Basford double as scavenger hunts, and they’re a great way to zone out for long stretches of time. 
 How many articles have you saved for future reference on Facebook lately, or left open on a tab at work? Start using apps such as Instapaper or Pocket that let you catch up on your reading offline, and migrate over all that good content. Then throw in some podcasts (or audio books on Audible, if you’re a persistent paper-hater); offline language lessons courtesy of 
; and games that make you think a bit, like 
 or 
. If you’ve never tried the last group, they’ll surprise you with how long they can engage and entertain you.
 
Two things to bear in mind: The electronics ban applies only on inbound flights to the U.S., so there’s no need to forgo your laptop or tablet on outbound journeys. But having access to gadgets on one leg means you’ll have to keep them secure on the other.
Avert suitcase theft by starting with the right bag—preferably one with buckles instead of zippers. (Zippers are much easier to break into, with or without a TSA-approved lock.) The 
 is the size of a carry-on but newly rereleased with a stronger, more dent-resistant construction that makes it perfect for checking; these 
 by Zero Halliburton can also do the trick.
Then stick 
 onto your gadgets to make them trackable; the adhesive chips have GPS sensors and sync to a dedicated app. And look on the bright side: You’ll have far less to schlep around the airport and into those perpetually crowded overhead bins.

=== Title: Richard Branson Opens B.V.I Art Reef Scuba Dive Site - Bloomberg ===

Richard Branson has launched many a business venture. Rarely has he intentionally sunk one.
But that’s exactly what he’ll do on April 10 (weather permitting), when he cuts the ribbon for his latest endeavor, a historic naval ship turned scuba site just south of Mountain Point in Virgin Gorda, part of the British Virgin Islands. When it sinks into the Atlantic Ocean, the 
—one of five surviving ships from the attack on Pearl Harbor—will officially become 
, a man-made marine ecosystem and otherworldly dive site crowned by an 80-foot-long Kraken sculpture.
It may be located near the billionaire’s exclusive 
 estate, but Branson’s new project is as democratic as they come.
For one thing, unlike Virgin Galactic which will be shooting tourists into space for $250,000 a pop, visiting the B.V.I. Art Reef is free if you take yourself, and is not meant to be a massive moneymaker at all. Proceeds will come in through diving operators—a majority of whom charge a modest $100 for single-tank dives at other sites in the B.V.I. What's raised from local outfitters will be funneled out to support various regional causes, from marine preservation to social justice initiatives. Boosting youth swimming-education programs at Branson’s multifaceted, not-for-profit foundation, 
., is one big-picture goal.
"The B.V.I is a collection of small islands surrounded by beautiful coral reefs full of life, yet many people from the B.V.I have never had the opportunity to witness this thriving underwater world because they have never had the opportunity to learn how to swim,” Branson told Bloomberg in an interview, citing a statistic that one in 10 children is unable to get across a pool. “One of the reasons why I have been supportive about this project is that I believe it will inspire people to want to learn how to swim, snorkel, and ultimately scuba dive—and my greatest hope is that, as that happens, they will fall in love with the world that lives beneath the surface and will become passionate to protect and preserve it."
While marine conservation is a personal passion for Branson, B.V.I Art Reef began with an entirely different preservation story, that of the decommissioned 
. Despite the ship’s 
, it had decayed past the point of repair; an unknown owner had abandoned it in the B.V.I., and it was scheduled for demolition after spending years in a junkyard. In short, the 
 had become an eyesore. 
“In the B.V.I, we have a lot of derelict ships that are aground on the main island of Tortola,” explained Branson. “They detract from the natural beauty of the place.”  
One of Branson’s team members, a marine mechanic and photographer named Owen Buggy, saw an opportunity: “[Buggy] pitched the idea to me of cleaning this ship of any environmental hazards and then intentionally sinking it to become an artificial reef and recreational dive site,” recalled Branson. It didn’t take much convincing for the serial entrepreneur to get on board.
Restoring the 
 has been a nine-month endeavor. Though the investment sum was undisclosed, the project is likely to have cost more than $4 million, which is what it cost to create and sink 
 in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this year. The project was made possible by funding from 
, a global network of industry disruptors; engineering help from B.V.I-based Commercial Dive Services; and the artistic vision of six creative masterminds from 
, Art Reef B.V.I.
“We've been fortunate that, through collaboration, we've been able to accomplish what would have been very challenging—well, impossible—to do on our own," said Branson.
At a private party on April 12, after it's had a couple of days to settle on the ocean floor, Branson and his team will take an inaugural dive around the site and then honor the 15 founding members (and other helping hands) at a party back at Necker Island.
A robust coral grafting program will follow. In time, Branson expects the coral to propagate naturally and create a thriving ecosystem—one that he hopes will bring back the endangered goliath grouper. (Having the massive fish in these waters doesn’t just make for good diving; grouper are also natural predators of invasive lionfish.)
Simultaneously, marine researchers will come in and start studying the effects of artificial reefs on rehabilitating over-trafficked dive sites. And the Art Reef team will also work with local operators to create “dive adventures” (think: scavenger hunts) throughout the site, encouraging travelers to support small businesses, rather than tackling the site on their own. A portion of those proceeds will then cover site maintenance, making the project fully self-sustained. It’s almost as if one of the world’s smartest businessmen came up with the proposal.
Luckily for travelers, it’s never been easier to get to the B.V.I: The first direct flights from the U.S. to Tortola will launch this summer on 
, with departures from Miami. As a bonus, Laurance Rockefeller’s 50-year-old resort on Virgin Gorda, 
, is soon to emerge from a multimillion-dollar facelift courtesy of Rosewood. It’s closer to the Art Reef than Branson’s flamingo-filled Necker Island, which sits on a private spit of land on the northern end of the archipelago. Then again, yachting over from Necker doesn't sound quite so bad, either.

=== Title: The Secrets to Booking a Luxury Trip to Cuba - Bloomberg ===

The 
 has been one of the best places to stay in Havana since it opened in 1875. Its colonial façade and bright neon signage fit right in with the nearby capitol building and Gran Teatro, and its guest book includes such famous names as Cuban national hero José Martí.
There’s just one catch: The property is stuck in time, just like the rest of Cuba. You’ll have to pay $312 a night for what looks like a Holiday Inn, albeit one with pretty terracotta-tiled floors.  
In the six months since independent travel from the U.S. was 
, tour operators have introduced itineraries and major airlines (such as American and Jet Blue) have 
 into Havana. By the end of the year, the Inglaterra will be rechristened as part of Starwood’s 
, becoming the company’s second hotel after a 
 opened earlier this year. 
But when it comes to hotels in Cuba, there’s almost always a catch, just as there is at the Inglaterra—and that problem isn't likely to go away soon.
Just ask Leo Ghitis, owner of one of Costa Rica’s most luxurious hotels, 
. When he was approached to open a property in Havana, he took the first flight out. “I received a tremendously warm welcome,” he said about his meetings with the minister of tourism and top government officials. “But even after getting the red carpet treatment, I had to decide to postpone my plans,” he said, citing major infrastructural limitations.
That doesn't necessarily mean you have to settle for mediocre accommodations should you choose to visit. Despite the island's many challenges, comfortable and beautiful options 
 exist if you know where to look. And if you play your cards just right, a five-star trip to Cuba can be 
.
 
Just because you can buy a plane ticket and fly to Havana with your significant other doesn’t mean it’s the best place for a spontaneous getaway.
“Many of the larger reputable hotels in Havana are reserving their rooms only for big group trips of 40 to 60 travelers,” said Melissa Biggs Bradley, founder and chief executive officer of 
, a members-only travel company that has been coordinating trips to Cuba since 2011. The reason, she says, is that they “prefer to sell a few big blocks of rooms instead of one-off reservations,” which results in little availability for independent travels.
There are other benefits to going with a group, aside from having an organizer who can help you navigate 
. Bradley advises DIY travelers that bookings made on many hotel websites can get bumped or cancelled by the tourism authority—often without warning. Plus, she says photos can be misleading; a perfectly nice-looking hotel may be subject to frequent water shut-offs or power outages. (Those who aren’t members of Bradley’s organization can book luxury trips via 
 and 
.)
If you’re dead set on going without a group, book through 
, which guarantees all its reservations by selling rooms from preassigned blocks. But plan on booking at least three months ahead.
“There are wonderful places to stay in Havana with five stars, but the demand is high,” said CTN sales agent Javier Arevalo. As he flipped through availability at Havana's most luxurious hotels—the 
, 
, and the 
—he found slim inventory through the month of October. 
 
Pursuing a project in Cuba has unparalleled logistical challenges. All staff need to be hired through a government-run agency that charges hoteliers roughly $700 a month per employee—but keeps a majority of that sum for itself. Bonuses for employees who deliver good service are strictly forbidden, which means there’s little incentive to provide a five-star hospitality experience. What’s worse, supplies on the island are limited in quality and availability, and business owners are prohibited from importing what they can't buy locally.
There’s one categorical exception to all these rules: cruises.
The leader thus far is 
, a volunteerism-oriented cruise line 
, with weeklong itineraries that dock in Havana, Cienguegos, and Santiago de Cuba. The cabins on the 704-passenger 
 are brand new, with floor-to-ceiling windows and balconies and access to numerous hot tubs on the pool deck.
Starting in January 2017, there will be an even more alluring option for luxury-seekers: yacht-based cruises with 
. The itineraries are still being finalized, but the company says the seven- and eight-night voyages will stop in Havana and Santiago and sail on the 64-guest flagship, 
. The cabins are small but sleek, with nautical-inspired décor and satellite phones (which are especially handy in disconnected Cuba).
 
Hotels around the world are afraid of Airbnb’s competition, but in Cuba, home sharing came first.
“Cubans have been opening their doors to all types of travelers from all over the world for more than 20 years through the country’s existing 
 (private homestays) network,” said an Airbnb spokesperson, who claimed that the company is learning more from Cuban hosts than the hosts are learning from Airbnb’s hospitality experts.
Rooms in private homes—beautiful ones—
 and offer an opportunity to connect with locals in meaningful ways. And thanks to a transparent booking system and satisfaction guarantees, many of the question marks associated with hotels simply don’t apply. It’s one of the best options for discerning travelers, both in Havana and beyond.
 
If you can resist the temptation to book the first commercial flights out of the U.S.—they depart on Aug. 31—you might find it worthwhile.
For one thing, overcrowding has become an issue. Even before Obama approved independent trips this March, the country had already seen a record-breaking million travelers in the first quarter of the year. One report 
 discovered that some travelers were sleeping in taxi drivers’ back seats for lack of better options. So waiting for Cuba to put finishing touches on some of its 50,000 planned hotel rooms may not be a bad idea.
Infrastructure will also get better with time. A key example: Wi-Fi availability.
Ghitis, the hopeful hotelier, described deep frustration at the quality of Wi-Fi on each of his recent visits: “It can take several hours, literally, to be able to see your e-mail,” he said. “If you remember when AOL started with dial-up, that’s what it’s like. And you get disconnected every one or two minutes.”
That’s if you’re lucky, he claimed—most hotels don’t have Wi-Fi at all. This problem is being phased out: Last month, the country began installing its first public Wi-Fi hotspots across the island.
None of this means that Cuba’s stuck-in-time character is in danger of disappearing overnight.
“Cuba’s not going to change tomorrow—or in two years,” said Cuba Travel Network's Arevalo, a lifelong local. But he’s optimistic about what his country has to offer. “People are already going to Cuba, loving it, and wanting to go back again and again. We’re busy every day, and we’re thankful for that.”

=== Title: Five Ways Airlines Are Making It Easier to Sleep on Planes - Bloomberg ===

For every inch of lost legroom in the back of the plane, there seems to be one new amenity in the front. A disproportionate number of these new offerings are promising to give you the single thing that’s most elusive at 35,000 feet: a good night’s sleep. Here, a snapshot at the most relaxing new perks in the skies—mostly in business and first class; sorry, coach—including a few that might warrant leaving the melatonin at home.  
 
It all started with Delta and the Westin Heavenly bed—the first big effort to improve sky-high sleeping habits back in 2013. Three years later, United is upping the ante. The airline has just announced its 
, which will begin rolling out this December. One of its major draws is custom bedding from Saks Fifth Avenue (think ultra-soft duvets, pillows, and mattress cushions). Similarly, the Scandinavian carrier SAS has recently introduced Hästens brand bedding on premium seats. Perhaps the cleverest amenity, though, can be found on Etihad. No matter where on the plane you sit, the brand provides pillows that convert from standard size to neck pillows, along with eye masks that bear the words, "Do not disturb" or "Wake me for meals."   
 
Etihad's pillow sprays and pulse-point oils, courtesy of Le Labo, were first to market two years ago; now the trend is going viral. Travelers on late night flights with Virgin Atlantic can spritz themselves with High Altitude, a blend of fragonia, eucalyptus, and lavender to fall asleep easily, while United is offering lavender-infused pillow spray from the U.K.-based, Soho House-affiliated Cowshed Spa.    
 
This spring, Air France wised up to the fact that few travelers want to be awakened for dinner service at midnight on an overnight flight. The solution: Let premium passengers take their meals in the business-class lounge before boarding. (The service is available only in New York's JFK for now.) The concept is taking off: British Airways’ Club World Sleeper Service, for instance, lets passengers order meals ahead of their flight departure and enjoy a nightcap on boarding instead.
 
Anyone flying on a new

Before you scoff at your airline’s in-flight entertainment, consider that meditation programming is increasingly popular—it has proven effective for both jittery and restless fliers. Virgin Atlantic has a video series that borrows from Andy Puddicombe’s popular meditation app, Headspace; Delta’s just-launched, 10-minute flicks are from YouTube favorite “OMG. I Can Meditate”; and British Airways has jumped in with a series from the Mindfulness Institute.

=== Title: How to Get Two Vacations for the Price of One - Bloomberg ===

When Icelandair launched its 
 in 1948, the year the airline made its debut, it was out of necessity—not savvy marketing. Without a license to travel directly from North America to Europe, the only way for the carrier to fly was to offer a layover in Reykjavik. “Back then, the airline operated flights on two separate licenses,” explained Michael Raucheisen, a spokesperson for Icelandair. “One from North America to Iceland, and another from Iceland to Europe.” 
By 1955, said Raucheisen, “the thought stuck that we should let these travelers see Iceland,” and the free stopover was officially born. Being able to pit stop in Iceland for a few days between connecting flights was like getting a free vacation within a vacation—it became an instant hit with hippie backpackers through the ’60s, and though it has been offered continuously since then, a concerted marketing effort a few years ago brought it back into the spotlight.
Since 2012, Iceland’s stopover program has seen year-on-year increases of 30 percent to 39 percent, with 50 percent of Icelandair’s passengers flying via Iceland and 31 percent of that subset taking advantage of the free extended layovers, which can range from one to 13 nights. Ask any tour operator in Iceland what effect the stopovers have had on local tourism, and they’ll unanimously agree: Icelandair’s promotion has been the single largest catalyst for the exploding 
.
At least a dozen other airlines since 2012 have followed suit with similar programs. Last year, the Portuguese airline TAP added a 
 with one- to three-day layovers in Lisbon, which is the second-closest European capital to North America, after Dublin. “In our 75-year history, we had essentially been selling ice to Eskimos,” said Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a TAP spokesperson, about the airline’s tendency to sell Portugal to the Portuguese diaspora. Focusing on a core group of visitors to Portugal meant planes were full in the summer and empty in the winter, and the airline was struggling to stay afloat. “A stopover program became the key to our expansion strategy—it lets us sell all of Europe to all of North America,” he added. Approximately 40,000 travelers have taken advantage of the program since its launch, and the airline is in the midst of a renaissance moment.
Since not all stopover programs are created equal, we’ve put them to the test. Here are the ones worth trying and the ones to skip—plus a few extra hacks that’ll get you two vacations for the price of one.
 
Stopping in Reykjavik is convenient for many itineraries from the U.S. to Europe—particularly if you’re heading to Scandinavia. And a 
 on the airline’s homepage makes it easy to find and book stopover flights from 18 destinations in North America to 26 destinations in Europe. Not all city pairs will yield solid results, though: Route availability was limited when we plugged in a trip from New York to Barcelona, for instance, forcing us into an inconvenient (and expensive) itinerary for the sake of a weekend in Iceland.
 
This is one of the best deals, and not just because Portugal makes a natural stopping point en route to most European (or even African) capitals. First, the stopovers are 
 and superflexible: They’re available in either Lisbon or Porto, for intervals of 24, 48, or 72 hours. Then there’s the companion app, which helps you get around or book partner hotels at special rates (or get a free bottle of wine at select restaurants). But the best part? Adding a stopover decreased the total cost of our flights by as much as $40.
Book a multi-city fare with a few days in Qatar,and your total cost shouldn’t go up by more than $15—making a stopover essentially free. What you 
find, however, are 
: $20 tours of the new I.M. Pei Museum of Islamic Art, dirt-cheap desert safaris, and preferential rates from five-star hotels. Plus, the airline will waive the costs of a transit visa for stays up to 96 hours.
 
Compared to some other programs, AirCanada’s 
 is a limited one: It subsidizes only the cost of a hotel room in Toronto, Montreal, or Vancouver if your flight has a layover of six hours or more. (The hotel rooms are free if you fly in a premium cabin.) It’s worth it, however, to break up a long flight between, say, Houston and London—where you could pit stop in Montreal for a meal at Joe Beef and a few hours of sleep in a bed, rather than a cramped steerage seat.
 
Adding a long layover in Singapore won’t come free on this airline, but your costs on the ground might as well be. 
 that start at $43 per night include everything from hotels to airport transfers—more than justifying an otherwise inconvenient promotional itinerary that nets you a cheap flight to Asia.
 
It’ll cost you around $25 to add an 
 to your flight, but you’ll save what you’ve spent when you let Etihad coordinate an experience that suits the length of your layover—a steeply discounted set of holes, say, at the top-tier Yas Links Golf Club if you have only six hours to spare. Staying a little longer? They’ll set up free overnights at five-star hotels if you’re flying business or first class.
 
Though you can’t stay overnight with Turkish Air’s 
 program, passengers with 6- to 24-hour layovers can join scheduled walking tours to see such sights as the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, and the Grand Bazaar free of charge. Everything from the guides, to museum admissions, to airport transfers is included—and you can leave your luggage with the service desk at the airport for a minimal charge.
 
Although most stopovers are promoted as “free,” some are anything but. Finnair made a push for its new 
 last year, but we found that the stops were hardly free; on some routes, they added as much as $320 to a fare and took us out of our way. Ditto stopovers in Sydney with 
—which cost about $200 and would be helpful only for onward journeys within Australia. The worst offender was 
. A route we tested from San Francisco to Bangkok was $2,732 without an extended layover in Tokyo; with the layover, the price jumped to $4,169.
Other stopover programs are overly cumbersome to book. To book a Panama City stopover through 
, for instance, you have to put your airfare on hold and get on the phone with a reservations agent in the hope that your route is eligible. And 
 makes you jump on a call with a travel agent or a local Emirates office to add stopovers to existing tickets.
 
Stopovers aren’t the only way to book a free (or ultra-affordable) side trip. The website 
 lets you put in your origin and destination points along with a preference for length of layover—it then suggests airfares that save you money by adding an extended stopover. (Think two days in Copenhagen or Berlin on your way from New York to Vienna.)
And even when airlines don’t promote stopovers, they’re worth plugging into a multi-city airfare search. Stopping in Lima for a few days on your way to Cuzco often reduces fares on LAN, for example. (And who doesn’t want to pit stop for a couple of excellent meals in this 
?)
For loyal fliers, United and Alaska Airlines’ reward programs actually allow for free stopovers no matter where you’re heading—as long as you’re using miles.
And if all you’re after is leisure, leisure, leisure, think about booking a cruise with 
: the luxury liner actually includes pre- and post-cruise hotel stays at all its disembarkation points.
 

=== Title: Nine of the Most Extreme Dining Experiences Money Can Buy - Bloomberg ===

Usually, being an adventurous eater means ordering offal, snakes, and game meats—or in Beijing, scorpion on a stick. But at these 10 spots, the adrenaline factor has nothing to do with what’s on the menu. When it comes to dining in a crane above the Acropolis or in the spray of a waterfall in the Philippines, you’ll need your sense of adventure just to get to the table. Next time you're craving an experience that'll make the hairs on your neck stand up, consider making a reservation ...
The Thrihnukagigur Volcano, in the Southern Peninsula of Iceland, might be dormant, but setting up for dinner in its cavernous magma chamber is still a thrill. According to the guides at 
, one bespoke operator that can coordinate the experience, the space is large enough to hold three full-sized basketball courts or the Statue of Liberty tilted on her side. But it’ll be all yours—for a meal entirely of your design.
How about sharks for dining companions? That’s what you’ll get at 
, the underwater restaurant at the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island resort. On the menu are such dishes as saffron champagne risotto, mascarpone and truffle dumplings, and lobster carpaccio, among other luxe-leaning dishes.
Anyone can book a tour of the 
, which harvests Pacific oysters in the Tasman Sea. But stay at Tasmania’s most luxurious hotel, 
, and you’ll be invited to a table to stand knee-deep as a culinary guide shucks the freshest bivalves you’ve ever tasted—pulled straight from the water and set on your plate.
(Here’s how we’d recommend you spend the rest of your time in 
.)
Don’t be fooled by the rustic connotation of dining in a treehouse—this isn’t what you remember from childhood. Luxury outfitter 
 will coordinate a treehouse dinner at 
 in the Seychelles that starts in the property’s garden; there, you can pick your favorite ingredients with the hotel’s chef de cuisine. He can whip them up for you or show you the ropes in the kitchen before you climb a spiral staircase to your ultimate dining destination: in a towering banyan tree.
 
Back in the 1700s, Italian nobility would dress up up to dine cliffside at the Summer Cave at Puglia’s 
, now a tried-and-true spot on the global tourist map for its postcard-perfect views. Here, the catch of the day comes with a side of sea spray from the Adriatic below. Be prepared to arrive early: You’ll have to maneuver through ascending and descending cobblestone stairways just to reach the hostess stand.
Elevated dining is a literal term for 
, which sets up sky-high meals for up to 22 diners in 40 cities around the globe. Its most jaw-dropping location might be above the Acropolis, where adrenaline junkies are served a five-course meal on a crane hoisted 50 meters (about 160 feet) in the air. Among this summer’s worldwide events: dinner above the Mexican ruins at Teotihuacán, on the coast of St. Tropez, and hanging precipitously over downtown Los Angeles.  
Dining at Angkor Wat may actually be less an adventure than visiting the iconic ruins at any other time; without crowds, the landmark and its surrounding temples are dreamy and serene. Travelers with Jacada can access the grounds past the site’s normal operating hours for a private Khmer-style dinner under a tent on the temple grounds—though the privilege will run you a cool $11,000. Blessings from a Buddhist monk are included before the first course, natch.
Time it just right and you can walk to 
, an aptly-named spot that juts 22 feet above the Indian Ocean. But once the tide rises, you’ll have to take a boat to and from this floating restaurant off the coast of Zanzibar. The menu, predictably, focuses on whatever can be caught in the surrounding waters (octopus, prawns, lobster). But the main thing not to miss is a sundowner on the deck—be it a classic Negroni or a more locally inspired Dawa, made with Konyagi (a citrus-y East African spirit), honey, and tonic.
 is a lovely resort on a 130-year-old coconut plantation in the Philippines, two hours southeast of Manila. But it’s most famous as a place to rest your head after a once-in-a-lifetime meal at the Labassin Waterfall Restaurant across the way. Here, bamboo tables sit so close to the foot of a man-made waterfall that shoes are absolutely not encouraged. (The waterfall was built to mitigate runoff from a nearby dam.) Don’t bother with a poncho, either—getting wet is half the fun. 

=== Title: The Mercedes 300 SL Is Hotter Than Ever on the Vintage Market - Bloomberg ===

The original Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Gullwing is the most collectible Mercedes on the market today. Depending on how you define “collectible,” that is.  
“It’s the most collectible postwar Mercedes hands down,” said Phil Skinner, the collector car market editor for Kelley Blue Book. “The car is an icon. Beautifully crafted. Beautifully styled. An absolute performance vehicle. If you want to get the ultimate Mercedes, the 300 SL is the pinnacle.”
Robert Moran, director of Mercedes communications, is a little more circumspect. 
“The rarer Mercedes race cars are more valuable than the 300 SL—they’re in a completely different stratosphere,” Moran said, noting one 
 that sold several years back for nearly $30 million. “When they come up on the auction block, they are dominant.”
McKeel Hagerty, chief executive officer of 
, sees it all with a little more nuance.
“Look, we’re talking about the best here,” he said. “If you like good wine, you can buy very good California cabernet. Some aficionados may say they’re good, but they’re American-style and a bit gauche, so true Mercedes connoisseurs say the race cars are rarer and better, like a French Bordeaux. But the gullwings are like a really great California cab: They’re really expensive, and you can’t deny how good they are.”
Indeed. The 300 SL is a true collector’s vehicle regardless of whether it lands in the premier spot of a given group. It is a foundational pillar of a complete collection. And right now, it’s hot.
The 300 SL was the first production gullwing car created and is the grandfather of the modern SLS AMG, the $222,000, 583-horsepower gullwing coupe. “SL” stands for the German phrase “
” (sport light), so-named for its lightweight aluminum chassis and sporty tubular body (more on that later); the 300 refers to its 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine.  
Mercedes debuted the 300 SL at the New York Auto Show in 1954, where it became an instant success largely because of its iconic doors but also because of its link to success on the track; its direct predecessor, the W194, had won prestigious races like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Eifelrennen at Nürburgring, and Mexico's Carrera Panamericana.
The story goes that Mercedes’s New York distributor, Max Hoffman, followed the wins closely and suggested to the boys back at corporate that affluent Americans newly wealthy post-World War II would certainly buy a road-legal version. So Mercedes decided to give them one.  
The 300 SL had a welded aluminum tube chassis designed to compensate for its relatively underpowered engine; its main body was steel, with a hood, doors, and trunk lid all made from aluminum, to save even more weight. So the car was light (just over 3,400 pounds) and strong, but its design also made traditional doors impossible. Which is exactly why Mercedes developed the doors-open-up style.
“Those doors were almost an afterthought,” Moran said. “It’s one of these form and function details that have become part of its allure.”
Aerodynamics helped determine that famous form as well: Engineers placed those straight metal "eyebrows" over each of the wheel openings to reduce drag.
And that odd body shape also birthed the “power domes” on Mercedes hoods that we’ve seen so many times since its era. The domes—slight bulges in the hood—were made to accommodate the inline-six engine in the 300 SL, which had to be tilted up at an unusual angle in order to fit in the unnaturally low front cavity. One of the small bumps in the hood was made to fit over the top part; the other was added just to match the first.
“The first was functional, and the second was functional aesthetically,” Moran said. “It was all about symmetry.” 
Under those domes, the SL had the world’s first-ever production direct-injection engine, which had barely been featured yet, even in race cars. It was 
 supercar of its day, with more than 200 horsepower and, at one point, the world’s fastest top speed for a production vehicle: just over 150 mph when it debuted, and 161 mph a year later. It could hit 60 mph in eight seconds. 
Paired under the engine was a rear suspension design with a dual-pivot swing axle famously prone to slipping and sliding and oversteering at every opportunity (the roadster featured a redesigned single-pivot axle, which made the car much more neutral to handle and less prone to oversteer). It had progressively precise steering, a four-wheel independent suspension that made it comfortable to drive, a four-speed manual transmission, and even air conditioning on later models.
Think of it as the historic equivalent to the modern McLaren F1 or Ferrari LaFerrari. Driving one, Moran said, is a life-changing experience.
“It is basically a race car: It’s got an amazing engine that wants to run all day, the handling is great, it makes all these amazing noises,” he said about the all-black 1955 300 SL he drove for days during the famous Italian Mille Miglia car race last year. “It does run a little hot, so when you pull in to get gas, you open the doors to let it air out a little, but you’re also putting on the greatest spectator show. People go nuts. It’s instant international relations.”
In fact, the 300 SL changed Mercedes’s image in America from that of a quiet German car company that made staid luxury sedans to one that could also dominate a field of high-performance whips. Sophia Loren, Tony Curtis, Clark Gable, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Stavros Niarchos all owned one.
Of course, all that cachet comes with a price. Original 300 SLs had a starting price of around $11,000, more than twice as expensive as the general $5,000 Cadillac convertible. Mercedes made only 1,400 or so before switching to the open-top roadster version, heavier but easier to drive (better brakes, better suspension, that single rear axle), in 1957.
And since then, well, the sticker price has skyrocketed. In 2014, Russo & Steele 
 a ’56 Gullwing SL for $1.32 million; earlier this month, Bonhams 
 a ’55 Gullwing SL for $1.34 million. Next month in Arizona, Gooding & Co. will offer 
, the cheapest of which is listed with a low-end estimate of $900,000.
“The values are astronomical now,” Skinner said. “The cost of a 300 SL is going to be between $1.8 million and $2 million on average for the coupe.”
Interestingly enough, the 300 SL is one of the few models where the closed-top car is worth more than the open. While gullwings may do up to $2 million, roadsters generally hit between $1.4 million and $1.6 million. That’s because of the coupe’s singular gullwing design, which didn’t reappear again on the production market until the 1970s and ’80s (
 or DeLorean, anyone?), and because the coupe was closer in design and philosophy to the original racers. 
Either version, though, makes men drool.
“The cool thing about both the Gullwing and the Roadster 300 SL is that if you have the money to buy one, any single one of them, you know you have a world-class car,” Hagerty said. “There are rarer Mercedes, but no one is ever going to look at an SL in someone’s garage and thumb their nose at it.”
The SL is one of the few cars that have universal appeal, with consistent strong interest from the top collectors the world over. Unlike, say, a Chevrolet Corvette, which is popular to collect for American buyers but not as much for European or Asian money, the Mercedes-Benz SL is not regionally specific. According to data from Hagerty, the average price of a 1956 300 SL Gullwing in 2006 was $450,000. This year, it’s $1.6 million. Similarly, a 1962 SL Roadster averaged $350,000 in 2006; now it’s $1.7 million.
Here’s your caveat, though: The SLs have become more prevalent on the auction block in recent years. Last summer at the Monterey auctions, the number for sale was close to 30; it was more like a dozen or so in previous years. The explanation is simple: People who realize they have a million-dollar opportunity sitting in their garage tend to want to sell. Hagerty said the increased popularity will eventually slow the stellar investment gains but that the car’s increasing value will remain “very stable” for the foreseeable future.
“They absolutely have proven to be good investments,” he said. “For a buyer looking for that world-class car but who doesn’t want to spend $6 million on something more rare, they’re very safe cars to buy.”
(
, here’s a car-world life hack: If you want something similar to the 300 SL but don’t have the extra million, consider the smaller 190 SL coupe, which looks similar but usually sells for 
.) 
Those who do go for the big fish will reap plenty of joy, experts say. The SL is one of the few blue-chip vintage cars viable as a weekend driver—even if its affections don’t come cheap. Like any high-performing athlete, it requires close maintenance.
“You do have to worry about the care and feeding of the SL,” Skinner said. “It’s not like a modern car where you can just hop in and turn the key and go for a ride. You’re looking at a $12,000 or $13,000 repair job just to get something like the radiator replaced.” 
Not that anyone who paid $2 million for a weekend driver is going to quibble over 10 grand. On the contrary, in this rarified air, to pay such a pittance is considered part of the privilege.

=== Title: Hammock Floors Take Overwater Bungalows to a New Level of Luxury - Bloomberg ===

Close your eyes and think about the most relaxing place in the world. Is it a private pool overlooking a volcano in Costa Rica? An outdoor massage table in 
? The top deck of a yacht in the South Pacific?
All of those (very good) answers might just be out of date.
In 2017, it’s all about hammock floors, or small trapeze nets built into the bottom of your patio, rather than slung from trees. The design takes a cue from the catamaran, whose seating almost always comes in the form of an aerodynamic net that acts like a stretchy sundeck on the back of the boat.
The advantages over traditional hammocks are plentiful. First, there’s no limit on how large you can make one, since each is custom-built. (Which makes cuddling up a 
 more convenient.) Then there’s the fact that you can build a hammock floor on almost any overhang, regardless of whether there are trees or walls to serve as structural support. (Think: the private pool deck of an 
, or a dizzying perch high up in a treehouse.) They’re made of bouncy, tightly woven netting, making them feel almost like trampolines. (Which means you won’t be laying on knotty ropes.) And maybe the icing on the cake: You don’t have to awkwardly climb in. (Tipping over into a net is easier and more fun.)
Here’s where to find them, from Bora Bora to the Dominican Republic.
 
Hotelier Sonu Shivdasani calls the hammock floors in his properties' overwater bungalows “dream zones,” and with good reason: There's nothing quite like dozing off as you're dangled gently over lapping waves. But there’s also something to be said about the ones he built into the outdoor movie theater and bar at 
, where the ledges of the hammocks double as cocktail tables. “It acts as a very informal gathering point,” he said, “but can also make for a romantic cocktail experience.” Sundowners have never been so sweet. 
 
It’s the first five-star resort to open in Bora Bora in a decade, but the 
 was worth waiting for. It debuted on Monday with 86 overwater bungalows—each outfitted with customizable pillow menus, massive soaking tubs, and yes, hammock floors on the private decks. "Any resort worldwide provides sun beds," said Daniele Venuti, regional director of sales and marketing. "Within a few years, most of the beach resorts will probably feature overwater hammocks, too, and we'll be thinking about something newer." 
 
The new 
 at this 
 is possibly one of the most beautiful places to stay in all Thailand: The two-bedroom suite spreads across two pavilions, each surrounded by jungle thickets and flanking a full-sized private pool. The most novel features are the built-in hammock floors that line an entire side of the compound, acting like a sunken deck. Dive in early in the morning and watch the sun rise while you listen for elephants rumbling in the distance. 
.
 
When it opened nearly a year ago, the 
 introduced Andaman Sea-facing hammock floors off the back deck of its pan-Asian Kayu Puti restaurant; they’ve proved so popular they were built into every one of the 77 overwater villas at the just-opened 
.
"The closeness to nature that these floors provide is really special," said Lisa Holladay, global brand leader of St. Regis Hotels & Resorts, who noted that they're also gold mines on social media. "We’ve been excited to see the hammocks appear as the ultimate Instagram picture!" 
 
Most properties on this paradise island put the focus on the pearl-white sand beaches and turquoise waters—and so does 
, which has been a mainstay since opening in 2009. But its new villas, which will go online for rentals later this year, sit on the edge of a bluff, with hammock floors built into overwater terraces that stretch down into untouched waters. 
 
This hotel claims to have the 
—the "Private Reserve" structure clocks in at a whopping 18,300 square feet. Naturally, it has every bell and whistle in the book, hammock floor included. Also on the amenity list: a private cinema, a spa, and a two-story waterslide that plunges directly into a fully private lagoon. 
 

=== Title: The Celebrity Edge Is the Most Innovative Cruise Ship Ever - Bloomberg ===

Richard Fain, the chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., is willing to bet $5 billion that he can take everything you know about cruising and flip it upside down. Or at least outside in.
On Monday, he and Lisa Lutoff-Perlo, CEO of Celebrity Cruises—one of three brands in the Royal Caribbean family—announced a new category of ship that, among other transformational design moves, brings stateroom balconies indoors. With a push of a button, the floor-to-ceiling windows of Celebrity Edge-class staterooms retract like a super-sleek garage door, leaving nothing but a simple glass railing between your living room furniture and the crystal-blue sea.
“When I started [working in the cruise industry] in the 1970s, nearly zero ships had balconies. It was all portholes,” reflected Fain on a phone call with Bloomberg. Since then, balconies have been the golden rule for hard-core cruisers.
But fast forward to December 2018, when the first of five Celebrity Edge-class vessels is scheduled to leave the shipyard, and both portholes and balconies will become a thing of the past. At least, that’s what Fain and Lutoff-Perlo are betting on.
These balconies on-demand are just one of the first-to-market design features raising the price tag of Edge-class ships to $1 billion a piece. Here’s what else to expect on these tricked-out ocean liners, which are packed with enough bells and whistles to make even the most fervent anti-cruiser consider a trip on the high seas.
 
By redefining the balcony, Celebrity is able to expand cabins right up to the edge of the ship—almost like an infinity pool. As a result, stateroom floor plans are (on average) 23 percent larger than before, with bathrooms gaining an extra 20 percent of square footage. This is a feat of engineering much larger than meets the eye: Currently, balconies help distribute the weight of a boat, and bringing them indoors requires boatbuilders to redesign the vessel's support system. Making ships bigger isn't the answer if you're looking for increased square footage, either, as many ships are already too large to dock in popular ports. (They solve that issue by dropping anchor off shore and ferrying guests to land in smaller boats.)
“We have been reimagining shore experiences for a long time,” explained Lutoff-Perlo, who says the glassed-in staterooms “let us transform how guests experience destinations when they’re in port or out on sea.”
 
Imagine a mini-deck—it’s the length of a tennis court—that hovers off the edge of the ship, moving up and down along a vertical track almost like an elevator. That’s the Magic Carpet, a new public space that will serve different purposes at different times of the day. When it’s positioned on Deck 2, it’s a stylish disembarkation point. On Deck 5, it becomes a lunch spot with wraparound views.
Up on Deck 14, it’s an extension to the pool area, sometimes with a DJ. (Think of it as a pool party that comes and goes, explained Lutoff-Perlo.) And in the evenings, the Magic Carpet will anchor at Deck 16, where it’ll become a fine dining restaurant that's cantilevered over the sea. Said Lutoff-Perlo: “Where else in the world can you get this experience, sitting 16 stories above the sea, dining by moonlight with a view of Barcelona?”
 
Suites have traditionally made up five percent of Celebrity’s room stock; on Edge ships, they’ll represent 12 percent of the accommodations. Included are six duplex villas that shed the traditional décor you’ll find on, say,  luxury cruise line Cunard’s two-floor suites—instead, they have private plunge pools and direct access to the one of the ship's sundecks. Eucalyptus-treated cashmere mattresses from Italy, Bulgari bath amenities, butler service, packing and unpacking support, and a bar that’s set up based on your own preferences: They’re just a few of the signature amenities for suite guests. “They look like a beautiful hotel that just happens to float,” said Lutoff-Perlo, who added that if you opt for the penthouse suite, you’ll get a better view than the captain. “It’s set right over the bridge,” she said.
 
The last big innovation in cruising dealt with RFID-enabled wristbands that let you scan in and out of the ship at port or charge drinks to your room. But wearables are a thing of the past, said Lutoff-Perlo. On the Edge ships, you’ll be able to do everything on your phone, from checking in to unlocking your stateroom door or controlling your room’s temperature and lighting. It all happens via a proprietary Celebrity app, which also puts the concierge, ship map, and daily event schedule in each guest’s pocket. “We’ll send you notifications for the things you’ve told us you’re interested in and use it to reduce pain points across the entire experience,” said Lutoff-Perlo. “It will help us personalize your cruise as we’ve never been able to do before.”
 
The so-called resort deck on the Celebrity Edge ships takes the adult pool concept to a whole other level. The pool itself is enclosed by a tessellated, glass-like dome for all-weather access—it’s called the Solarium—that leads to a rooftop garden that one-ups the lawn clubs and rooftop terraces Celebrity has typically installed on its previous ships. The garden will be landscaped with sculptural trees and maintained by a dedicated horticulturist so that it can be used for jazz parties (think live music, wine, and blankets) or dinner-and-a-movie nights. It’s all designed by Tom Wright, whose stamp is also on the iconic Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai.   
 
Lutoff-Perlo and Fain both talk about the Edge class as an evolution in modern luxury, capable of drawing more affluent younger travelers and converting them into cruisers.
 “When you have to sign a contract for $5 billion, your hand shakes. But now that I've seen the design, my hand no longer shakes,” said Fain. And Lutoff-Perlo indicated there’s more to come. “Every new feature needs to be a must-see, must-have experience—that’s true of all these additions, along with several more amazing things we’ll be revealing later on,” she teased.

Though his words are more than a century old, there’s a decidedly 2017 ring to John Muir’s proclamation that “going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity … useful not only as fountains of timber but as fountains of life.” 
Back-to-nature adventures are a big highlight of this year’s 
 an annual trend forecast from the travel specialists at 
, whose clients ranked hiking first among all active pursuits. Also noticing the pattern is Travis Katz, co-founder and chief executive officer of 
, a travel-planning platform that lets users join “tribes” to find personalized travel recommendations.
“Our data is clear—travelers want to unplug and explore nature,” Katz said. “Our Outdoor Enthusiasts and Adventure tribes have each grown by nearly 35 percent since the beginning of 2016.” 
What’s driving everyone into the woods?
Beyond the collective need to unplug and detox, “all the recent reporting on how dangerous our sedentary lives are has really started to take hold among travelers,” says Betty Jo Currie, a Virtuoso adviser and founder of 
. “I’ve actually had clients cite specific articles on the importance of moving more to start the conversation about active vacation possibilities. The topic comes up constantly now.”
Whether you’re motivated by health, screen time saturation, or plain old spring fever, you’re in luck. Some of the world’s best hikes happen to surround some of the world’s best hotels. And while these five-star stunners offer a full array of trekking to suit any fitness level, we’ve picked their most iconic routes to establish a ranking order: novice-friendly, intermediate terrain, and brag-worthy challenges. 
Its setting alone—a solitary cliff that soars over the Amalfi Coast—would suggest that 
 turned boutique hotel offers some seriously stunning walking trails. The four-level garden does nothing to dispel that notion, and roam you should.
But the real local trekking begins at Amalfi’s central square, where the town’s famed Duomo serves as one of the world’s most beautiful trail heads. Follow the gradually ascending Valle delle Ferriere for a two- to three-hour hike that passes through lemon groves, ancient foundry ruins, and farm houses—one of which you can stop into for lunch. Your post-hike reward? A dip in the hotel’s infinity pool, where you’ll have the supremely trippy illusion of floating above the Gulf of Salerno. 
The foothills cuisine of the American South earned 
 a rep as one of the world’s great foodie retreats. But those same foothills also offer a way to burn the calories you consume.
After an al-fresco breakfast of buttermilk biscuits smothered with sage-and-sausage gravy, take a bucolic mile-long walk on the Walker Mountain loop. You’ll traverse rhododendron thickets, spot leafy pawpaw trees (whose mango-like fruit you can try back at the farm), and likely pick the hotel’s namesake berries straight from heaping bushes. 
Consider the psychedelic red rocks that surround this 
 your invitation to hit the local trails. There are 100+ hiking routes in the vicinity, and the hotel has the experts at 
 on hand to help you pick the one that’s right for you. The four-mile Courthouse Butte Loop Trail is a stand-out, thanks to its far-out formations. And if you feel a tingling sensation as you hike, there’s a reason for that: The Bell Rock vortex, a spot where mystics say energy swirls out of the earth’s surface, is located about a third of a mile from the trail head. 
Once a Maharaja’s palace, and now an Ayurvedic retreat with a sprawling spa, 
 might be the plushest place to hike the Himalayan foothills.
Despite its approachable altitude (4,500 feet), you’ll still get views of the area’s signature snowcapped peaks from the three- to four-hour Kunjapuri Temple Trek that leads to an intimate, incense-filled shrine to Shakti and Shiva. Equally transcendent: hiking downhill through the area’s Sal forests to a suspension bridge over the Ganges. Make it to the riverbanks by sunset, and you’ll witness Aarti, a daily ritual in which hundreds of chanting pilgrims pass flickering oil lamps through the crowd along the water’s edge. 
The 19th-century Bellefontaine Mansion, said to have been modeled after the Petit Trianon at Versailles, anchors this 
 in the Berkshires. Beyond its expansive gardens, you’ll find the glorious two-hour Flag Rock trail.
It starts with a moderate ascent through the woods of Monument Mountain and culminates in a wide-open vista over the old-timey village of Houstatonic. The best part? Spa treatments are included in the all-inclusive rates. 
Sir Richard Branson is not one for understated luxury, and 
 in the rugged Atlas Mountains is no exception. The compound of fountain-studded courtyards, tent-topped suites, and petal-filled pools is a fantasy fortress fit for the surroundings.
Nearby Mount Toubkal is North Africa’s highest peak—you’ll see it from your three-hour trek to the Anfa lookout in Toubkal National Park. Along the way, you can stop at a mud-walled Berber home, cozy up on beautiful woven rugs, and chat with locals over fresh mint tea. 
 
Australia’s third-largest island is a known hiking hotspot—all coastal cliffs, outsize rock formations, and wildlife-rich bushland—but the recently inaugurated 
 has taken that rep to new heights. The full 38-mile circuit takes five days to complete, which has more to do with endurance than technical difficulty.
Then again, breaking the route into segments and driving to and from trailheads is an option—and it allows you to recharge nightly at 
, a secluded, clifftop spread where “recovery” can mean soaking in an ocean-facing wooden tub. But which trail sections to prioritize? The first and last: They’re known respectively for platypus sightings and intricate cave systems. 
It’s twice as deep as the Grand Canyon, but Colca is much more than an 11,000-foot-tall cutout in the earth. The condor-filled gorge is surrounded by misty peaks, forest-shrouded waterfalls, and Inca-era agricultural terraces, making it perfect for vertiginous day-long hikes or two-day treks. Thankfully, 
 piles on the creature comforts: water features that massage your neck and shoulders in the pool, blazing fireplaces in the chalets, and a craft cocktail menu to rival Lima’s best. 
As much as schussing down the slopes of the fabled Engadin Valley is a must-do for skiers, trekking up those same slopes is a must-do for hikers. Base yourself at the historic, lakeside 
, where the staff see to your every hiking need (including posh picnic baskets).
As for the trails, you almost can’t go wrong in the Swiss Alps. One of the most beloved routes: the four-hour journey that links the wintertime sledding area Muottas Muragl, Segantini Hut, and the village Pontresina. You’ll climb to almost 9,000 feet, where you’ll be rewarded with jagged views that are said to have inspired Swiss painter Giovanni Segantini. 

=== Title: Rediscovering the Awesomeness of a 1967 Cadillac Coupe de Ville - Bloomberg ===

Last weekend Beyoncé did more in 5 seconds for the El Camino than General Motors marketing did for years.
Her 
, which dropped right before her Super Bowl halftime performance, showed the lady plush in white fur leaning out the passenger side of an ice-blue El Camino, long braids nearly brushing the ground as her afro-d driver cuts donuts in a lot. She looks amazing. And so does the car. 
Here’s another vintage GM gem: The 1967 Cadillac Coupe de Ville.
This is the signature whip Caddy made from 1946 to 2006, with prime years in the ’60s (older ones look like overstuffed pillows). The line included both convertible and coupe versions, both intended as iterations of the perfect car for cruising around the neighborhood. The name, of course, is French for “of the town.”
I borrowed this particular Coupe de Ville from a man in Detroit who has owned it for decades. Cadillac has worked hard to recapture the allure of its past cars, and I wanted to get a feel firsthand for what exactly made them cool. So after pulling some strings to get the car on location one freezing day in January, I got my chance to see for myself.
This one is painted in “Persian Ivory” white, with seats inside that are the color of marshmallows. Everything in it is original, from the push-button radio and stick-thin steering wheel to the “de Ville” badging and silver rims. Even the power windows hold true to the original model.
Better yet, you can identify this thing from a mile away—it is about a mile long, after all. (By which I mean nearly 19 feet, more than a foot longer than a 
.) It’s made completely out of metal, sculpted into cigarette-boat elegance, and festooned with a grill that looks like emerald-set diamonds.
The car has an 8-cylinder, 340-horsepower engine that ran as smoothly when I drove it as it did nearly 60 years ago. How smooth is that? Like how you feel when you look out an airplane window and see puffy white clouds just inches below you. It’s like entering a dream state so placid you half expect to see Care Bears and Unicorns frolicking alongside you in the cotton candy pillows. Trippy.
Driving it provides a good commentary on what the motoring style was during the time; it provides a good reference for just how far the auto industry has come, both in mechanics and in creature comfort. It helps fill in the spots on GM's timeline of progress through the years and gives a fuller picture of where the company is headed.  
These days you can buy a mint-condition de Ville for around $20,000 (up from around $6,000 when it came out new). Don’t expect to get great gas mileage or anything, but you can expect to cruise easily at 80 mph or so along the road. Or spin it around in your personal music video. Bey would be proud.

=== Title: The Vintage Mercedes Station Wagon Is the Car That Will Never Die - Bloomberg ===

Here’s something that will last forever: the famous 1970s-era Mercedes station wagon. Mercedes-Benz’s first wagon model belonged to its W123 series and was specified by the use of the letter “T” in its model designation, such as the 300TD and 230TE labels, among others. (T stood for transport and 
, according to Mercedes.)
We all adore its long, quirky, European body and cool square edges—see one parked on the street, and someone in your group will squeal, “Oh! I 
 those old wagons!” But I’m not talking about a car that will endure for an eternity in 
.
I mean it literally. This thing will. Not. Die.
“You cannot kill them,” Phil Skinner, Kelley Blue Book’s collector car market editor, said recently. “They just keep on running. It’s Mercedes technology—and on a station wagon! It’s the perfect combination.”
Jonathan Klinger, a spokesman for car insurer Hagerty, said almost the exact same thing.
“If you say ‘overbuilt, overengineered, bulletproof,’ this is the era and the series that comes to mind,” he said. “This is literally the car you cannot kill.”
When they came out in April 1978, they were the most expensive station wagons on the market; Mercedes sold them at a little more than 26,000 deutsche marks a pop (roughly $15,000). These were the cars that started Americans on the road to their current luxury SUV obsession—the first modern vehicles that were both practical and relatively luxurious. Up until then, it was one or the other.
“At the time, if you wanted to go to the Hamptons with the kids and the dog, you really didn’t have a lot of options,” said Mike Kunz, manager of the Mercedes-Benz Classic Center in Irvine, Calif. “You could have bought a Jeep, but that was in no way a luxury vehicle. It was crude, really.”
The W123 line helped introduce new technology such as antilock brakes (optional from August 1980), a retractable steering column, and the driver air bag (optional from 1982). (Some of those technologies, like ABS, were introduced either later or not at all for U.S.-bound cars at the time.) Many had wood interior trim with a passenger side exterior mirror, power windows, central locking, and rear-facing extra seats. How novel! Mercedes sold a five-speed manual transmission in Europe and a four-speed automatic transmission in the U.S. (The naturally aspirated 300TD wagon had only a brief career in North America, as a turbocharged model replaced it in 1981.)
Bottom line? They appealed to people who needed a workhorse they could use and abuse.
“Earlier station wagons had really cool styling, but you rarely see them,” Klinger said. “They had a utilitarian purpose to haul a lot of people. They got used up and thrown away.”
Or used up and put in film. The crazy bad guy People Eater used a modified W123 Lang on his chase across the desert in 
. 
Lately there’s been a gentle re-interest in the ol’ wagons, if only because they look so distinctive and aren’t as ubiquitous as classic Ford Mustangs or Porsche 911s. Klinger said this phenomenon tends to happen 30 years or so after a particular model’s debut—people want to collect cars they know their buddies won’t be able to emulate.
“It just happens naturally for a lot of old cars,” he said.
In fact, Mercedes sold only 6,830 of the little 230T wagons produced from 1978 to 1980, but it sold more than 28,000 of the 300TD Turbodiesel version from 1980 to 1986 before they went out of production. All told, Mercedes made just fewer than 200,000 of the wagon variants during production worldwide.
“It kind of has that little sweet spot where it can be a collector vehicle or it can be someone’s daily driver—or it can be both,” Klinger said. “And let’s face it, there’s not a huge following of early minivans.”
It’s also a tribute to the wagons’ fortitude. By all accounts, Mercedes outdid itself when it engineered this metal machine. (Compare that with fellow renowned preppy heartbreakers, the 
.) They’re not powerful, and they’re not quick, but it’s simple in the kind of genius way all of the best things are. And as the saying goes: If you take care of them, they’ll take care of you.
If you’re looking to buy, look for something with the fewest miles possible and an extensive service record. Assuming the mechanics are sound, you can follow routine preventive maintenance and expect to get hundreds of thousands of miles out of these puppies. Klinger said he has even seen taxi drivers in Europe with more than a million miles on theirs.
You can also expect yours to hold its value. If you average out the entire generation of the W123 chassis Mercedes 300TD station wagon, for instance, the value for those in “average” condition (which means a presentable and drivable example) has increased 5.19 percent since 2010, according to Hagerty.
You can buy one in mint condition for $20,000 to $25,000, or you can buy one that has a few love-scratches but still runs for as low as $5,000. And, just like their drive personality, they’re not going anywhere.
“We don’t especially see them going up like crazy on the collector market, and that’s OK,” Klinger said. “They hold their value. You’re not going to lose money just because you want to have something a little different than other people out on the road.”

=== Title: Travel Insiders Reveal Their $1 Million Dream Trips - Bloomberg ===

According to a recent study, Americans would spend an average of 
 if money were no object—almost exactly the same amount as the average salary nationwide. But if money is no object, why not go whole hog?
In an effort to find the real definition of no-holds-barred luxury, we asked seven travel insiders to dream up how they would spend a cool million on the trip of a lifetime. Their answers were inspiring, with deep dives spanning entire continents and options that touch every corner of the globe (sometimes all in one vacation). In short: It’s time to upgrade your bucket list.  
 Tom Marchant, co-founder of 
, one of the world’s leading bespoke tour operators
“I’m drawn to the natural beauty of Africa and it’s hard to pick which region speaks to me the most. So if I were to design the ultimate trip, it would be a private jet charter down the continent from Cairo to Cape Town with multiple stops. I’d revisit some of my favorite iconic places such as Kruger National Park, the Okavango Delta, and the Serengeti. I’d dive deeper into Ethiopia—one of the hottest places in the world [temperature-wise]—where I would summit active volcanoes, join camel caravans across the barren landscape, and explore Bale National Park, which is still off the tourist map (for now). And I would add in some rare cultural and physical experiences, like climbing the Brandberg mountains in Namibia one day and soaring above the Namib desert by hot-air balloon the next. It would all be a mixture of testing physical limits, retracing the steps of iconic explorers, and diving into the unknown—but with gorgeous secluded lodges or private camps as accommodations at the end of each day.”
 
 Andrew Zimmern, peripatetic gastronome and host of Travel Channel’s 
“If I had a million to spend on the trip of a lifetime, to whom do I listen? The angel on one shoulder or the devil on the other? One voice tells me to rent a 
 for a few months, fly to Europe with my son, show him Capri and Ischia, Sardinia and Sicily, sail the Greek Isles, pass through Cyprus, and go by private rail from Budapest or Istanbul across Central Asia. Show him 
, the glory of St. Petersburg and the 
, fly to China and spend a few weeks navigating to Hong Kong, then Thailand and Vietnam. I’d sail the South China Sea and 
. From there we head to the Solomon, Cook, and Samoan islands, across the Pacific to Ecuador and on through South and Central America. We could cross the oceans once again and make it to Namibia, where we could start a northern-bound voyage from Botswana to 
 and back to Europe again. Ultimately we’d wind up in the 
 and fly home to Minnesota direct on Iceland Air. Should take about 4-5 months and easily run through the million.
And yet I think I’d rather listen to the voice on the opposite shoulder and go to a place like Milobi in Suriname, or the small coastal towns of Senegal, or the wilds of the Amazon, or the southernmost tip of Madagascar to a Sakalava town and park myself for a few months and spend the whole wad making sure that one impoverished village—one community beyond repair—had food, water, and electricity in perpetuity. That would be pretty f--king cool.”
 
 Horst Schulze, chief executive officer of 
 and former president of Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co.
“I’d begin by traveling to Peru, where I’d hire a very well-versed guide for a private tour of Machu Picchu. Then I’d go back to Lima to explore the city’s high-end restaurants as well as its street food—Lima is said to have some of the 
. From there I’d travel to Chile, where I’d visit Easter Island and discover its secrets. I’d hire a guide to take me around the Galapagos and teach me about the region’s unique flora and fauna, both by land and by sea.
I’d continue the theme in the sub-Antarctic wilderness of Tierra del Fuego, where I’d hire a guide for the ultimate fly-fishing trip. The sea-run brown trout there average 10 to 13 pounds in weight and are sure to be impressive catches. By then, I’d be close enough to the tip of the continent that I could charter 
 and discover the final frontier. Where better to take in nature than on a Zodiac boat, cruising along glaciers, watching whales and penguins?”
 
 Superstar photographer Murad Osman, known to his 378,000 Instagram followers as 
“I would open a roving photo school for children and take my students on a worldwide photo tour. A lot of talented people were born in poverty and live in hard conditions, but they dream big—we try to tell their inspiring stories 
. So a worldwide tour for young amateurs would be a great way to do what we do best as photographers: to share the beauty of different countries and help a younger generation discover the world. I would buy them their own 
 and have them shoot with me and other photographers; who knows, maybe we can create a new generation of big-name professionals. We would visit all seven continents, see the deserts, waterfalls, jungles, fly in helicopters and meet sunsets in mountains.”
 
 Social media impresario Jeremy Jauncy, founder and CEO of 
, the largest travel account on Instagram
“A dream trip of mine would be to charter a jet with 
 from New York City to Hong Kong. While I'm there, I'd stay at the 
, for a bit of an escape that's still within the city limits. Their GM, Marcel Thoma, is a true legend. From Hong Kong, I'd jet over to Tokyo and stay at the 
, another sleek oasis in the center of a metropolis. After that I'd take a break from my urban vacation to head to the beach. I'd fly to Cebu in the Philippines and charter a private yacht to Palawan, where I'd stay at 
, one of my absolute favorite hotels. These are all some of the world's most beautiful destinations and a dream trip for sure.”
 
 Will Drew, group editor for 
 awards
“Unsurprisingly, my dream trip would involve a food-led world tour, with some superb wine thrown in for good measure! But that doesn’t mean it would be restricted to fine dining and super-luxury hotels (at least not all the time). As we all know, the ultimate 21st century luxury is time, so I’d love to be able to travel through Asia in no great hurry, exploring the amazing variety of culinary cultures, street food, and landscapes. I’ve never been to Japan or Korea, so a few weeks of serious eating there would be essential. As well as taking in the huge variety of amazing restaurants that Tokyo has to offer, I’d love to visit Fukuyama in the west, the Gifu prefecture in central Japan, and Kyoto, the home of 
 cuisine. In Korea, I’ve just learned about the traditions of temple cuisine from chef Mingoo Kang, and I’d like to get a taste of that. I’d also love to explore more of South America, taking in Chile (including Borago and 99, among others), Argentina (too many to name), and Brazil (with Lasai and A Casa do Porco high on the list), including the wine regions, of course, as a glorified gourmet backpacker.”
 
 Sam Shank, CEO and founder of the last-minute booking app 
“My family loves to travel. My wife and I strive to show our sons (ages 7 and 11) that experiencing new places will expand their horizons and creativity. Nothing beats the cultural immersion of actually living somewhere new, so if I had a million dollars to travel, we would take our boys out of school for a year and spend three months apiece in four different destinations. The rules: Each place must be on a different continent. Each must have a different climate. Each must have a different native language. Each should be totally unique. And wherever we go, we’d take a lot of spontaneous weekend getaways. I asked my family for ideas at dinner and came up with Sydney, Paris, Singapore, and Buenos Aires as a dream itinerary … but we’d also be game for playing it by ear!”

=== Title: Suitcases to Help You Pack Better, Travel Easier: Arlo Skye, Vocier - Bloomberg ===

Forget about techy suitcases that 
 and 
—they sound a lot more useful and exciting than they really are. Instead, focus on suitcases that are innovative where it matters most—in helping you pack better, more efficiently, and best of all, wrinkle-free.
Here we test out four models that aim to ease your next business trip.
 
 Anti-microbial liners, packing cubes, and shoe sleeves to keep everything neat and organized
 
The Tumi and Louis Vuitton alums behind Arlo Skye didn’t compromise on anything when they created their debut line of luggage earlier this year: scratch-resistant aluminum for their hard case exteriors, ultra-quiet Japanese wheels, Florentine leather for handles and trim. “It took more than a year and a half to design,” said co-founder Mayur Bhatnagar. But the product’s smartest touch has nothing to do with its glossy, Rimowa-like aesthetic or the built-in charging station—which Bhatnagar pointed out can be removed with the push of a button if you ever need to gate check the bag.
Here, the humblest bells and whistles are the most purposeful ones: simple organizational tools such as packing cubes, a toiletry bag with an over-the-door handle, and shoe sleeves that are all stitched from anti-microbial, odor-proof material. They make even the most botched attempts at packing look organized and keep dirty laundry from stinking up the rest of your business attire. Plus, compression strips allowed us to fit in enough clothing for a long trip that included five days of meetings and a few days of leisure in Morocco—no small feat for a carry-on.
 As much as these materials are meant to be scratch- and dent-proof, we found evidence of handling damage (include a scuff on our beautiful Florentine leather handles) after a couple of trips.
 
 A handsome leather duffle that unzips into two halves for easy packing, similar to a hard-sided suitcase. This is form and function at their best.
 
When the founders of Wool & Oak listed their “duffle suitcase” on Kickstarter, they were looking for $75,000 in seed money to bring their vision to life. It raised more than $500,000. On Indiegogo, it raised even more. (Units are already shipping.) Here’s the money shot: Unlike duffle bags that have a zipper across the top, this one zips all the way around three sides, just like a hard-sided suitcase.
Inside are pockets for your laptop and passport, with one clever compartment down the middle that’s designed for ties. Shoe bags are built in, there's an exterior strap for a newspaper or umbrella, plus a snap-on dopp kit that’s easily removable for TSA. Pick it up in one of four colors (oak, black, navy, or olive), all with a stylish polka-dotted lining, and keep an eye on this nascent company—they’ll be releasing backpacks in the first half of 2017.
 Like any other duffle, this one doesn’t have wheels, so carrying it can be tiring, especially when it's weighed down by all your clothes and a laptop (you really can fit a lot).
 
 The company's patented “zero-crease technology” system translates to a built-in garment bag. It's a feature in several of its bags, but we tested the premium C38 model.
 
The supple leather and briefcase-inspired design are just two indicators that this bag is designed for the dapper gentleman—but the patented suit sleeve seals the deal. The C-shaped zipper across the top of the case reveals a built-in garment bag; when you open it all the way, you can see how the compartment extends to the bottom half of the suitcase, creating the perfect space for an unfolded suit. (There’s even a removable hanger you can use to keep the suit hung up—even while it’s packed.) The rest of your clothing goes in a removable compartment, which nests into the carry-on after you’ve packed your most important outfit.
When we took it to Seattle and Boston, the Vocier mostly lived up to its wrinkle-free promise, as long as we were careful about how weight was distributed atop the suit sleeve. A passport compartment that’s revealed when you lift the bag’s handle proved to be clever and convenient; it keeps your passport hidden when you don’t need it and in easy access when you do.
 There’s a really clever (in theory) built-in dopp kit in a spill-proof compartment; it’s right on top when the suitcase is standing. You access it by opening a magnet closure on the suitcase’s main handle, which, in our experience, compromised its structural integrity. It repeatedly slipped open when we were lifting the case into an overhead compartment or the trunk of a taxi.  
 
 Instead of packing in one cavernous compartment, the Oregami’s body is made up of two big, interlocking packing cubes.
 
There’s nothing fancy or particularly luxurious about the Oregami, which looks like a standard-issue nylon bag, but its unique design is ideal for multi-purpose trips. Inside the carry-on are two big organizing trays you can unzip and pack individually. For my upcoming trip to Lima and Machu Picchu, for instance, I dedicated one tray to active wear (for hikes in the Sacred Valley), while the other was reserved for city clothes (for dinners in the 
). The idea is you don’t have to sort through (and wrinkle) all the clothes you know you don’t need when you’re trying to figure out what to wear.
 The compartments are easy to zip apart, but putting them back together is a frustrating endeavor. And ultimately, you’d get the same benefit from packing into a hard-sided suitcase that splits in half.

=== Title: The Jaguar F-Type S Coupe Is the Best Car Jaguar Makes for the Money - Bloomberg ===

True beauty distracts.
Try driving the Jaguar F-Type S coupe around for a few days. You’ll have teenage girls, middle-aged shop owners, and preppy blonde moms forgetting what they were doing and just staring at your svelte silver bullet of a car.  
You’ll also get dad-bod cops pulling you over on a random pretense and then pacing around it for 10 minutes while they run your license. “Uh, it looked like you swerved into the bike lane for a moment back there.” Thanks, fellas. 
More than one person I know told me they believe the F-Type is the most beautiful modern car you can buy—at any price—on the market today. That may be, although I’d venture that the 
, Aston Martin Vanquish, 
, 
, and Mercedes-Benz AMG GT also qualify as supermodel-caliber individuals.
And here’s what’s really distracting: that guttural burbling as the F-Type awakens, that resonant purring as it cruises, (some would say overly) dramatic screaming as it accelerates. The F-Type makes the most distinct and gratifying sound of any sub-$200,000 car on the market today. (No comment to the haters who decry its engine notes as somehow fraudulent because they’re deliberately exaggerated. I still like the noise.)
All this we know.  
The real question is, if you are considering buying this two-seat sports coupe made by such a vaunted British brand, should you pay $103,000 for the 550-horsepower V8 R version or save $25,000 and go for the 380-horsepower supercharged V6. 
If money is truly no object for you, and by this I mean you already own a number of other special cars and enjoy occasional track days in charming towns near your vacation residence (or one of them), choose the V8. It’s hangry for asphalt and vocal about it in a way the V6 can’t touch. It screams with feline fury when it pounces.
But if this purchase will be your one special car for a while, and if you plan to drive it around town and on weekend getaways, choose the V6. It offers the subtler, possibly chicer, elegance of moderation. (Two exhaust pipes rather than four on that V8, for example.) And it’s truer to Jag’s historic use of V6 engines anyway.
Not to say the V6 is moderate. Far from it. Gallivanting east last weekend, that 3.0-liter supercharged engine felt plenty adequate—even if it is noticeably more sedate than the F-Type R. It goes zero to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds, about the same as the 
 I drove last week. And it moved from 60 mph to 95 mph with no questions asked as I whipped around bulky SUVs and sedentary sedans on the way out to Montauk on Saturday.
Likewise, the F-Type S coupe is nimble enough—more so than its heavier V8 sister. It has a pleasingly stiff chassis and what felt like zero body roll as I wound my way over the hills and curves on Old Montauk Highway at a rate faster than advisable. It’s certainly more nimble than most things with a lower price tag. But when it comes to pure mobility, it can’t touch the flyweight exhilaration you’ll feel even in a Porsche Cayman or in a 
.
Jaguar has loaded this thing with such modern driving aids as launch control and adaptive suspension, which work seamlessly to enhance your time behind the wheel. The 8-speed automatic transmission (with paddle shifting) works well, as does the hydraulic steering. They make you feel simultaneously closer to the road without actually feeling the detritus (bumps, noise, heat) of being there.
If you compare this against any nonluxury car for its ability to surge and maneuver at high speeds, it’ll win every time. Thing is, this is no common car, and to earn respect it must compete with its rivals in the luxury market. Good looks alone won’t save you in this clubhouse, babe.
That’s why I characterize its driving character “more than adequate” and “works well” rather than mind-bending. For instance, the transmission in the 
 will make this one seem just 
 The $84,000 Mercedes-Benz SL roadster is just as, if not more, receptive to steering cues. And if you want to compete with the (granted more expensive) Porsche 911 or a Mercedes-Benz AMG GT for sheer speed, you’ll definitely need to buy the V8 F-Type R coupe.
But as I said, for the money, and for that million-dollar body, the F-Type S is the all-around best car Jaguar makes.
Plus, I like the small rear spoiler that magically deploys when you punch the gas at high speeds.
Plenty has been said about the fact that this car looks good from every angle. Every angle. The line of the roof is perfectly timed to break at the windshield and extend toward the front of the car at just the right length to be prominent but not obscene. The soft bulge of the hood when you view the car straight on suggests erudition in matters concerning speed. The near-vertical xenon headlamps stand alert to either side; the straight, small grille between them beckons with a Mona Lisa smile.
I should note that there’s a noticeable blind spot at about 7 o’clock and 5 o’clock behind your left and right shoulders, respectively, caused by the small windows in back. And the chubby rearview mirror can sometimes impede your view of stoplights and road signs as you look ahead. 
The long slim door handles, about the length of an iPhone 6 and an inch thick, automatically extend slightly when you unlock the car, enabling your easy access. A $3,400 performance pack includes adjustable drive settings, sporty seats, and race-ready metal pedals. You can also buy $13,500 carbon ceramic brakes, but for that kind of money, why wouldn’t you just upgrade to an R?
What you’ll be pleased to find is that the interior of the car supports the exterior in a way that compliments without overshadowing its allure. The dashboard is freer from clutter than those of Jag’s German counterparts, with just a few knobs placed intuitively near the driver. I don’t like the recessed touch screen in the center of the dash—it could have been set closer, easier to reach and use. But I do love the two high-backed, low cockpit seats folded in to brace you around corners.
The interior is also where you’ll be tempted to procure other posh trifles: $2,700 extended leather trim, $2,400 lighting and parking cameras, $1,800 power seat adjusters, a $1,200 panoramic sunroof, $600 heated seats and steering wheel (that’s separate from the power seat option), and a $450 sound system.
I’d go easy on the extras, though. The appeal of this F-Type is that it doesn’t need to be gussied up with a lot of expensive makeup. Keep it as a natural beauty, just the way God intended. 

=== Title: Best Beach Hotels: The Newest Summer Hotspots for 2016 - Bloomberg ===

Nobody ever said you had to love the beach in order to enjoy a great beach resort. At these 11 newcomers—all within a few hours of most U.S. cities—there’s far more to do than lie in a cabana with a margarita. (But we won’t blame you if that’s what the doctor orders.) This year, you can golf in the Dominican Republic from the comforts of an Aman resort, sleep in a villa in what’s been dubbed the “Billionaire’s Playground,” and even take cooking classes at a food-focused hotel in the Cayman Islands. Whether you’re in search of sand, sun, or both, it’s time to get planning.
 
 
For that kick-off-your-shoes, let-it-all-hang-out vibe, there’s nowhere better than Negril. And the new place to stay, hands-down, is 
, a takeover and total redo of the old Moon Dance Resort. Its 22 suites are some of the most spacious in all Jamaica, with floor-to-ceiling windows that frame the Caribbean Sea. Spend days at the natural saltwater pool or kicking back Red Stripes at one of three bars—just make it back to the hammock on your private terrace in time for those glorious Jamaican sunsets. From $260.
 
 
The Dominican Republic has just earned its own Aman resort in the form of the 
 Amanera, on a secluded beach that's an hour's drive from Santiago International Airport. Here clifftop casitas are dressed up in Aman’s signature brand of sleek, tatami-inspired décor, with private plunge pools and unobstructed views of the ocean. From $1,216.
 
Carved wooden headboards and gauzy white linens. Pearlescent beaches that seem to stretch for miles. A spa in a perfectly reconstructed, 300-year-old Thai house. Anguilla has no shortage of luxury hotels (hello, Malliouhana!) but 
 can compete with the best of them—without breaking the bank. From $350.
 
Culinary enthusiasts have traditionally had little to rave about in the Caribbean. 
 on Cayman Brac is hoping to change that. It started out as a few exclusive-use villas connected by a farm and pool and has now expanded with big ambitions to become a tropical farm-to-table oasis. Now it has a four-room inn, a culinary school, and two new restaurants that make nearly exclusive use of the bounty grown on site—though you can also get private chef service in one of two newly renovated villas. From $850.
 
You know owner Mark Christy as the owner of Hobie, the ubiquitous maker of sailboats and surfboards. Now the Laguna Beach, Calif., native is adding a feather to his cap with the opening of his first hotel, 
. It’s the first addition to the local hotel scene in over a decade, set on 83 acres of canyons and coast. Inside, the vibe is more upscale cottage than surfer cool, with batten wood-clad walls, distressed leather chairs, and rope-suspended, wrought-iron lanterns. Bonus: There’s extensive programming for all ages, including a Ranger Station kids' camp, yoga, archery, whale watching, and plein air painting classes. From $479.
 
It’s only accessible by helicopter, but 
 in the British Virgin Islands is worth the journey. It’s part of the “Billionaire’s Playground,” a nicknamed chain of islets that are mostly private-owned (by the likes of Richard Branson and Larry Page). Here, 88 villas, some forming a resort and others available for ownership, are spread on a parcel of 300 pristine acres; guests have access to such activities as deep-sea fishing, snorkeling, sailing, and pickleball—an increasingly popular spin on tennis. From $750.
 
There isn’t always substance behind the glitz and glam of Miami Beach, but that’s not the case at 
, a new 
 by the namesake Argentine developer. It’s home to some of the most whimsical décor this side of the Atlantic, including sumptuous custom fabrics on nearly every surface, a mural-covered space that’s literally called “the Cathedral,” and “Gone But Not Forgotten,” a gilded wooly mammoth by Damien Hirst that guards the pool deck. The food cred doesn’t hurt, either—after a months-long pop up of Chicago’s Alinea, the first floor now contains the country’s first restaurant by South American grill master Francis Mallman; upstairs, there’s a spot by Austin darling Paul Qui. From $381.
 
Luxury on the Jersey Shore? In a former Salvation Army building, no less? Believe it. Thanks to a 
, Asbury Park has 
, making the long-forgotten destination a viable alternative to weekends out East. Among the retro-inspired draws: a rooftop movie theater meant to resemble an old-school drive-in, a rec room with pinball machines, and direct access to the completely reimagined boardwalk, whose summer musical lineup includes such names as the Lumineers and the Violent Femmes. From $95.
 
This 
, known as the spot where Derek Jeter golfs and Bill Gates proposed, has been given 
 by its new owner, tech billionaire Larry Ellison. Now rooms all face the ocean for postcard-worthy views, and the dated interiors have been swapped for a kitsch-free Hawaiian aesthetic. (Think thatched wallpaper, sculptural rattan chairs, and bamboo-clad bathrooms.) If it meets Ellison’s exacting standards—and after a $450 million investment, it does—it’ll certainly meet yours. From $1,075.
 
She put Cartagena on the map as the ultimate stylish escape when she opened her first hotel in a historic house back in 2009, and now fashion maven Silvia Tscherassi is at it again. Her follow-up effort will have 42 impeccably designed rooms when it opens in the historic city center later this summer; it’ll take the 
 name while the original will be renamed Mansión Tcherassi. Expect whitewashed interiors with tons of textural interest. (The design plans are filled with Moroccan wedding blankets, exposed beams, and chalk-colored stone walls.) Price unavailable at press time.
 
Martinique shares many things with the French mainland—its language and currency, for starters, along with a love for fashion and food. The one thing it lacks that its mother country has in spades? Luxury accommodations. Enter 
, a Small Luxury Hotel opening at the end of June and the first five-star resort to open its doors on this pretty little island in a very long time. This is island life done right: private pools, a seaside cigar room, and French food made from ingredients grown on site are all part of the equation. From $675.

=== Title: Superformance MKII Slab Side Cobra Review: Video - Bloomberg ===

Owning a 
 is like being in a dysfunctional relationship. It can be purring along perfectly one moment, all systems go, and totally inoperable the next.
In both cases you may find yourself standing on the road next to something (someone) fuming and distraught, making loud noises, and threatening to leave you stranded indefinitely. 
Here’s one solution: Drive something that looks vintage but whose modern underpinnings afford daily reliability and practicality.
Enter the Superformance MKII Slab Side Cobra, a glamorous little roadster built by the 
with official licensing provided by Shelby. (See 
here.)
The car was designed to emulate the great Cobra 289 streetcars from the golden era of racing in the 1960s. Those had been based on the aging British roadster, the AC Ace, which had a 289-cubic-inch, small-block Ford engine; new designs gave the Cobra cooler front fenders and side air vents and that iconic nose. Now, decades later, Superformance has made roughly 4,000 of its front-engine, rear-wheel-drive tribute car.
With its 375-horsepower Ford V8 engine, classic Tojeiro-styled round-tube chassis, authentic transverse leaf spring suspension, and super lightweight body, this car is perfect to have on hand for after-hours jaunts and weekend thrills. I drove it for hours up and down the Pacific Coast Highway recently, and it was by far one of the most fun cars I’ve driven this year.
When you jump inside (and I do mean jump, since the tiny doors are so low they’re rather perfunctory anyway), you’ll love how the thin, slim steering wheel, plump leather seats, and smooth, short transmission all work in happy harmony to offer probably the most authentic driving experience you’ll have had in years.
The steering, brakes, windows, and locks are all sans power, as the good Lord intended—that's where that 
 comes in. Driving this rogue means you'll be cranking the wheels around corners and jumping on the brakes far earlier than you would in anything with power braking. But all the effort is worth it, both from a pure performance standpoint and because your arms and calves are going to be deliciously chiseled after all the effort.
The MKII Slab Side that I drove cost roughly $100,000, which includes the $70,000 chassis sent over from a factory in South Africa and the additional cost of the engine, installment, and gearbox. That number also includes such extras as the ceramic-coated exhaust pipe ($1,175), the heating and defrost system ($1,450), the leather interior ($1,995), and the soft ragtop ($2,595), to name a few.
It is all engineered so perfectly that you can have a normal conversation in the cockpit even at highway speeds, and it has all the little details the original car had in the U.K.: right-side turning indicators, tiny rear-view and side mirrors, a hood that opens opposite the front, latch-lock seatbelts, and dozens of hand-made knobs on the center console.
My only complaints? The fuel efficiency isn’t great (only 14 mpg in the city and 18 on the highway), and the clutch is basically not drivable if you’re short. I had the front seat moved as far forward as possible and at just under 5’11’’ could barely reach the pedals myself. Thank god for long-gene DNA.
If you want one of your own, though, place your order now. It takes six weeks to make them, and the wait list is about four months long. Which is understandable, after all. Good things—like good relationships—are worth the wait. 

=== Title: Modena Travel Guide: Plan a Trip Around Osteria Francescana - Bloomberg ===

So you want to go to 
? You’re in good company. Though it’s long been an established spot on the culinary bucket list, the small Italian city of Modena has officially shot up the ranks. It’s here—smack in the middle of Emilia-Romagna, Italy’s agricultural core—that you’ll find the most coveted dinner reservations on earth, at Osteria Francescana. Chef Massimo Bottura’s 
 is a blowout meal worth traveling for, but Modena offers much more for those who make the pilgrimage.
This humble town is a microcosm of everything that draws 48.5 million travelers to Italy each year. It has ancient-looking Romanesque architecture—its Piazza Grande is Unesco-protected and the main church dates to 1184. It’s a nexus for Italy’s deep-rooted culinary tradition, being the birthplace of balsamic vinegar. It’s surrounded by provinces known for producing the best parmigiano reggiano and prosciutto under the sun. And if that wasn’t enough, it’s also home to Ferrari, Maserati, and Lamborghini.  
Traditionally, Modena has been a place to pass through rather than linger in—that’s largely due to the fact that until a few years ago, there was nowhere great to stay. An earthquake in 2012 further stalled the city’s rise as a global destination. Luckily, rebuilding some of Modena’s most iconic sights, like the Estense Gallery, just culminated a few months ago—just in time for the city’s moment in the spotlight. Here’s everything you need to know about planning a trip.
 
On your mark, get set, go! Osteria Francescana 
 three months in advance at its website—which means July 1 will be the next chance for foodies to stake their claim. Even the best travel agents and concierges in the region have little to no sway over the system, as the restaurant has only 12 tables. Stalk the site at exactly 10 a.m. central European time (GMT +1) when tables are released, and plan your trip according to your draw. Missed your chance? There are waiting lists for every seating.
 
Most travelers to the region of Emilia-Romagna stay in Bologna, the area’s largest city and 
 in its own right. While Bologna has the largest supply of hotel rooms, most are midrange options that don’t quite impress. Instead, opt for one of four rooms at 
, a tiny but luxurious boutique hotel in a Modena townhouse, owned and operated by a former general manager at Osteria Francescana. The rooms have gabled ceilings, whitewashed wood furnishings, and an aesthetic that’s halfway between Provence and Rome.
For more of a countryside experience, book in to the Relais & Chateaux property 
, owned by another acclaimed Italian chef, Massimo Spigaroli (it’s where Bottura and his family take weekend escapes). It’s a little more than an hour’s drive away, near Parma, with its own Michelin-starred restaurant, expansive farm, and bespoke bicycles for rides through the surrounding area. Bonus: You’ll get one of the best hotel breakfasts anywhere in the world.
 
Aside from your table at Osteria Francescana, you’ll want to book a few insider experiences to make the most of your time in Modena. Uri Harash, a travel agent with 
, which specializes in culinary trips to Italy, can arrange visits to three balsamic vinegar farms, called 
, just outside the city limits; the artisans there will teach you all about the years-long production and aging process, how to taste vinegar, and what to look for when shopping for the finest stuff (hint: older isn’t always better).
For automotive enthusiasts, Harash can also one-up a visit to the sleek Ferrari and Lamborghini museums by arranging F1 track time with a professional Ferrari driver in the suburb of Maranello (20 laps will run you almost $9,000).
Modena may be the one place where you can have top-notch food 
 automotive experiences under one roof, so if both appeal, make a personal appointment at 
, the dairy where Bottura sources his parmigiano reggiano. According to local lore, the 80-year-old owner, Umberto Panini (yes, that’s his real name), bailed out Maserati from economic collapse in the 1970s, partially by buying up a lot of the company’s vintage cars. Now those, and many more, are housed in a barn on-site that doubles as Italy’s coolest car museum.
 
Modena is a small city, and inherently walkable. Make sure to visit the covered market on Via Albinelli (where you might run into Bottura or his wife, who shop there daily for produce and meat).
If you’d rather not carve out the time to visit balsamic vinegar producers in situ, get the crash course on the city’s most famous ingredient at the 
. It houses some of the oldest existing bottles of vinegar (which will likely never be tasted) along with personal production barrels, called "batteries," that belong to many of the region’s best chefs.
The 
 may not be as grand as the Uffizi, but it’s worth visiting—it’s newly reopened after three years of restoration work following the 2012 earthquake, and includes a rich collection of works by Bernini and Velazquez.
 
You came to Modena to eat, so you might as well pick more than one great spot to indulge. The local specialty is called 
—fried pillows of savory dough used to envelop paper-thin slices of prosciutto. Try it at 
, which churns out some of the best in town each morning.
 is a local institution and often has a line out the door; it’s a humble mom and pop place that makes an emblematic 
, or tortellini served in capon broth. Pay careful attention to the kitchen setup if you can—you won't see a refrigerator. That's because all of the ingredients are bought fresh daily.
For dinner, try Massimo Bottura’s more casual spot, 
, where you can order lots of little dishes to share, from ricotta-stuffed zucchini blossoms to veal cheek stew. It’s also a great place to try 
, a type of rare salumi made from heritage pigs in the neighboring province of Zibello.
Modena is about 100 miles southeast of Milan, making it an easy drive from Malpensa Airport. It’s a two-hour drive north from Florence, or a half-hour train ride from Bologna—the options for getting in are plentiful.

=== Title: Best New Private Island Resorts in the World: Maldives, Belize, Fiji - Bloomberg ===

You’re stranded on a deserted island. What three things do you wish for?
Correct answer: a private plunge pool, a butler, and a beach bar with excellent frozen drinks, preferably set on the deck of a sailboat.
Private island resorts are having a moment—and the timing couldn’t be better. A globally tumultuous 2016 has exacerbated the travel trend of seeking remote corners and untouched places, of getting away from it all and feeling physically far away from all your worries. It doesn’t matter what’s keeping you up at night at home; you’re likely to sleep easy when your biggest immediate concern is what drink will look best in your sunset Instagrams.  
If a bit of escapism is exactly what the doctor has in store, consider these nine openings that are pushing the envelope of luxury, from the Maldives to Belize. The best part? Several will run you less than $500 per night.
 
You’ll find a majority of private island resorts in the Maldives, Seychelles, and Fiji, where small, outlying land masses make the perfect setting for a dreamy hotel. And yet, this spot—
—might be one of the dreamiest places to sleep in the Indian Ocean. Opened on Nov. 1, it has 77 butler-serviced villas shrouded in lush tropical flora, with many hovering directly over the water. The style is all blond-wood minimalism, putting the spotlight on the palm trees that sprout in every direction and the crystalline waters that lap at your doorstep. 
 
From the shore, the 20 duplex villas that make up 
 look like shrunken mountains jutting straight out of the coastline, all woven bamboo and alang alang grass, each with a balcony, deck, and pool. This well might be the world’s most ambitious bamboo architecture project—which will come as no surprise to those who are already familiar with the owners’ first project, 
, which garnered a slew of hospitality awards for its innovative design and sustainability initiatives. (The two properties are fairly close to each other.) Just like its big sibling, Cempedak takes sustainability and community projects seriously. But that doesn’t make it any less a hedonist’s paradise. 
 
Slated to open early in the new year, 
 is one of the world's most anticipated new hotels. Its 14 villas are being designed by the architect who created Wilderness Safari’s North Island resort in the Seychelles—known by industry insiders as one of the most jaw-droppingly stunning hotels anywhere under the sun. It’ll be the first luxury hotel in Madagascar, where guests can go on lemur safaris. And it’s becoming a massive driver of conservation and community empowerment in the remote Nosy Ankao archipelago, with vibrant efforts to support local farmers and artisans. Talk about trifecta. 
 
It’s known as one of the best hotels in the Caribbean, so color us excited to learn that 
 has just introduced eight new, standard-setting beach bungalows. Each one is a study in china white, down to the white, denim sofas and linen curtains; outside are sea-facing rain showers and wide decks for nighttime lounging. But it’s the little things that make Kamalame special: daily homemade cookie deliveries, personal golf carts for each room, and an overwater spa for endless pampering. This is castaway living at its finest. 
 
For a private island resort, 
 is massive, with exclusive domain over the 652-acre Félicité island—one of 115 islets that make up the Seychelles. And yet, it keeps its footprint small, with just 30 one- and two-bedroom pool villas (and 17 private residences). Get there by taking a 20-minute helicopter ride (or an hour-and-a-half boat trip) from the main island, Mahe; you’ll arrive in a jungle paradise straight out of 
. Except here, the beds have flowing white-fabric canopies, the beaches are pearlescent, and the spa is among the very best in the world. Bonus: The property will also take you sailing to neighboring islands for private fishing trips, hiking in the Coco de Mer Valley, or sunset drinks. 
 
When Four Seasons launched their 
—which take travelers to their most luxurious properties around the world—the company proved that it was keen on taking luxury to new heights. Now it’s doing the same on dry land (and underwater) with the opening of its first private island resort, 
, where you, and only you, will have total domain over five pristine acres. It offers guests exclusive access to a 62-foot yacht, which you can take to go scuba diving in a Unesco Biosphere reserve right off the island’s shores. (It’s home to one of the world’s largest populations of manta rays—but you’ll also spot “underwater pinnacles,” turtles, and dolphins.) The property takes the “private” theme seriously: Its seven bedrooms, spread among three homes, can be booked only on an exclusive basis. 
 
Fiji is like Australia’s Hamptons, so it’s no surprise that Australian billionaire and real estate developer Lang Walker chose the island chain as the setting for his 
. It’s also no surprise that he called it Kokomo—Walker has an entire fleet of yachts with the same name, which 
 came from his childhood dinghy. The island, with its 26 super-sized villas and residences, is set toward the very northern tip of the Fijian archipelago, surrounded by the coral-filled Great Astrolabe Reef. But you may never leave the hotel’s main pool, with its silhouetted views of mountainous islands in the distance. Its bar, like all the other restaurants on property, uses organic fruits and vegetables from a garden right on site. 
 
 technically isn’t new—it’s 15-years-old—but the property has just undergone a top-to-bottom facelift, with 22 upgraded rooms off the coast of Belize City. But so many of the things that make it special have nothing to do with its glossy new look. For those who are far from the South Pacific, Turneffe offers a similar experience with a quick-hop flight. (Even the diving here is comparable, with proximity to the bucket-list-worthy Great Blue Hole diving site.) And the price point would justify a long haul: You can stay for as little as $2,090 per week, all-inclusive, depending on the package you book. 
 
 caters to the iconic Maldivian island fantasy: Its water pool villas have gabled, straw-covered roofs, turquoise-and-sand color palettes, and infinity-edge, plunge freshwater pools that seem to disappear into the Indian Ocean. Unlike so many other properties of its kind, it’s kid-friendly (for nine-year-olds and up). No matter how old you are, you’ll get a kick out of dining in the hotel’s signature restaurant, set on the deck of a traditional Maldivian sailboat. Go right at sunset, and order anything that was caught fresh that morning—your choices will be many. 

=== Title: With Floating Farm, New York Looks to the Future of Public Parks - Bloomberg ===

If you always thought Central Park needed more edible plants, you're in luck.
Come April, a farm full of fruit trees and other crops will float to locations in three New York City boroughs, and visitors will be invited to enjoy nature by literally picking, snipping, and sowing to their hearts' content. Located on a 5,000-square-foot barge, "Swale" will include 4,000 square feet of solar-powered growing space, including a perennial garden, an aquaponics area, and an apple orchard sponsored by Heineken USA's 
 atop a large man-made hill. (The hill allows deeper root space for fruiting trees.)
The project will be open to the public, but it’s more interactive exhibit than floating Central Park; only 75 people can board at once, and docents will usher guests around the grounds. Free educational workshops will include “painting with plants” and “dying natural fabrics,” and volunteers will always be on hand to explain how thoughtful permaculture planning can create a virtually self-sustaining farm.
But founder Mary Mattingly’s goals go far beyond providing city dwellers with a high-design place to forage for mushrooms in their next attempt at Beef Bourgignon.
She wants to make people work harder for public spaces, and public spaces work harder for people. She wants to create a model for sustainable urban farming. She wants to create an educational space. And she wants to eradicate the problem of food deserts in blighted urban neighborhoods.
“We don’t have much access to stewardship in New York City,” Mattingly told Bloomberg, “so we wanted to highlight and cultivate opportunities around that idea. People care for spaces that they can pick food from.”
That's exactly what appealed to the approving committee at the New York City Parks Department. "We are trying to prioritize community engagement," said Bram Gunther, co-director of the Urban Field Station, who cited a growing field of study that believes that community involvement, empowerment, and land management must all go hand in hand. "This project will act like a magnet, in a way, and inspire people to civic action," he added. 
That's exactly Mattingly's plan. Eventually, she hopes community investment (and city grants) will take the project from floating farm to philanthropic powerhouse. She’d like to use it as a springboard to raise awareness of such food deserts as Hunts Point in New York's South Bronx, where, Mattingly says, “10,000 trucks pass through each day, and everyone has asthma, and nobody has access to fresh food.” In her perfect world, Swale becomes a conduit to a public park in the Bronx, where “people could pick food 24 hours a day.”
Here’s the only issue with that: Public policy in New York makes that kind of project legally impossible—or close to it—as it currently stands. And on a trial run last summer, Swale barely raised enough funds to keep itself going for a second season. Its manifestation this year in the East River was made possible by the partnership with Strongbow, which has made it a brand pillar to conserve and create orchards around the world. Before Mattingly can sustain entire neighborhoods, she’ll need to sustain Swale itself.
There’s reason to believe in the project, though. First, there’s Mattingly’s own record: In 2009, she spent half a year creating and living aboard a fully self-sustained ecosystem on a barge in New York, which partially inspired the Swale project.
Then there’s the success of other so-called “food farms” around the country.
In Hawaii, the Malama Kauai Food Forest supplies several underserved schools and food banks—to the tune of 37,000 pounds of fruit and 1,000 volunteer hours in the last two and a half years. In North Carolina, the George Washington Carver Edible Park anchored a major urban revitalization project near downtown Asheville, replacing a trash-filled lot with a natural source for plums, figs, chestnuts, and pawpaws, among other things. The list extends to 
, 
, 
, 
, and beyond.
With the exception of a nascent project in 
, no other food forest has cropped up in such an urban setting. Certainly, no other initiative has as striking a design. So Swale should drum up interest. And with an advocate like Mattingly at its helm, converting interest into action should be a real possibility. Even if she fails to create her public farm in the South Bronx, she will likely open up a dialogue that can lead to lasting public policy impacts. 
And let's not ignore the twin goal of creating public stewards, which Gunther says is what he most looks forward to seeing. "The benefits start with people going to Swale and thinking about it—being more aware. Others will be inspired to come out each weekend and take care of their park or advocate for it." Over time, it's something that he thinks will come to represent "an evolution of more sophisticated community engagement in the New York City parks system."
Will Mattingly sail her concept elsewhere? Maybe. “People have approached us about using our plans in other cities,” she said, “but the scope of that seems pretty big for us right now.”
At least, one thing is for sure: There’s never been a more interesting way to treat your winter doldrums.

=== Title: Cars From the 1980s Are the Most Active on the Auction Market - Bloomberg ===

The reign of blue-chip Ferraris on the auction block could be over. 
Or will decline, at least, in the next few years.
That’s according to research by Hagerty Insurance in Traverse City, Mich.
The insurer and its classic car database have found that so-called modern classic cars from the 1980s and ’90s 
, based on 2015 auctions, especially the prestigious and important Gooding & Co., RM Sotheby's, and Bonhams auctions surrounding Monterey Car Week.
In fact, cars from the 1980s are the only segment with a year-over-year increase in average auction values. And they were the group with the largest increase in volume offered at auction, more than double what was sold in Monterey last year. Cars from the 1990s had the biggest increase in median sale prices in general, up 188 percent over 2014.
“There’s no doubt about it—’80s cars are the most active segment right now, followed by those from the 1990s,” says McKeel Hagerty, the chief executive officer of Hagerty. “If you look at the auction prices and our own data, the popularity is undeniable. This is the next generation.”
Porsche in particular has seen the biggest growth in popularity. Auction houses offered 27 more of them this year in Monterey than they did last year, especially 930s and 911 SCs. (The 930 is a flat-6 engine that was the top of the 911 range during the late ’70s and ’80s, and this line includes some of the first turbos Porsche made.) Searches for Porsche make up 23.5 percent of all queries by collectors ages 30 to 50. Ford is the second-most-searched-for brand name, with 18 percent of searches asking for that brand.  
Elsewhere, ’80s-era Ferrari 308/328s, Lamborghini Countaches and Diablos, and Ford GTs are the most popular models getting insurance quotes (the figures that owners check while insuring their cars), again with a younger demographic. The top five most popular 1980s-specific single models include the Ford Mustang, Porsche Carerra Turbo and 930 Turbo, the Lamborghini Countach, the Ferrari Testarossa, and the Chevrolet Corvette.
It’s a much more diverse group, both in origin and in price, than the Ferrari/Mercedes/Jaguar-heavy previous years. The new opinion seems to be that muscle cars and exotics have equal merit, provided they're in perfect condition with an impeccable pedigree.
In fact, classic car prices have plateaued this year after record-breaking sales in recent years that had stemmed from increased global wealth. This summer’s California auctions fell a few million dollars short of 2014’s $402.6 million in equivalent sales. Ferraris still retained top billing in sale prices, but RM Sotheby’s premier item—a $17.6 million red Ferrari 250 LM—fell far short of last year’s winning Ferrari 250 GTO Berlinetta, which earned $38.1 million and set the world record for a car sold at auction. (It was not radically different from the other 250.) And 25 Ferraris set on the auction block this year didn’t sell at all.
“Buyers are highly selective, and lately there has been an oversupply—the auctions are flooded,” Hagerty says. This has a dampening effect on enthusiasm—it can be embarrassing to pay hundreds of thousands more for virtually the same Ferrari as your buddy.
Why the push for the 1980s and 1990s models? It’s because the kids who grew up with Countach posters on their bedroom walls are finally pulling in six-figure salaries and can afford to live out their childhood fantasies, Hagerty explains. Credit the natural 30-year cycle of cultural touchstones such as cars (or fashion or music) going in and out of trend. It just so happens that now, as baby boomers age, millennials are gaining sway. 
It’s also a result of the simultaneous ubiquity and sky-high prices of Ferraris at blue-chip auctions: Discerning buyers will naturally move toward models that are easier to get, massively cheaper, and sometimes just more fun to play with.
“Maybe those guys can’t all afford a Lamborghini, but things like the ’80s Mustangs and Corvettes are pretty attainable,” Hagerty says. “These things are out there. There’s a real chance to get into this.”

=== Title: Best Around-the-World Private Jet Trips: Four Seasons, Crystal - Bloomberg ===

So you want to see all of the world’s greatest sights … in 29 days?
Good news: For the first time ever, it’s a realistic proposition.
But there’s a catch: You’ll have to do it on a private jet. And it’ll run you $159,000 per person.
At least that’s what Edie Rodriguez, chief executive officer of Crystal Cruises, is proposing with the company’s soon-to-launch 
, whose first “Around the World: Iconic Sights” tour will pit stop in Easter Island, Uluru, Lhasa, Jaipur, Victoria Falls, and Prague (among others)—all between Oct. 21 and Nov. 18.
Crystal isn’t alone. Luxury hotel companies from Peninsula hotels to Aman resorts and Four Seasons Hotels Ltd. are getting in on private jet tours; the latter has partnered with global star chef Rene Redzepi for a $135,000 culinary dream trip that spans much of Europe and Asia. So are safari outfitters such as Great Plains Conservation and AndBeyond, which is using private jets to link otherwise difficult-to-connect destinations, such as Kenya and Botswana. (The safaris range from $75,000 to $116,500 per person.) Top-notch operators 
 and 
 are offering global vacations built around exclusive charters. And the list keeps growing.
 
“Private jet travel inquiries have grown by at least four of five times in the last few years,” explained 
, a travel specialist at SmartFlyer who is an expert on complicated aviation inquiries. “But up until about three years ago, only one or two companies were offering private jet trips at all, and none of them were really marketing in a big way.”
And why should they? There’s no sense in turning your company into a household name if almost all households can't afford your product.
That has started to change, though. Fractional ownership companies have 
 on the private jet industry, putting private aviation within reach for a far wider demographic.
And luxury hotel companies—all vying for a brand image that ties them ever closer to ultra-high-net-worth spending—swooped in to capitalize on a new market and a new world of opportunity.
First to market was 
. “We began offering Private Jet trips aboard a third party vendor in 2012,” President and CEO J. Allen Smith told Bloomberg. “The response was overwhelmingly positive, but the missing piece for our guests was an end-to-end seamless Four Seasons experience.” So he led the company to 
—a 52-seat Boeing 757—in 2015, along with a custom 24-day, nine-stop, $119,000 debut itinerary. “It was a first for the hospitality industry and met with tremendous enthusiasm,” said Smith. “Every trip sold out that year.”
 
When Crystal launches its AirCruises this fall, it will catapult the private jet tourism business into a stratospheric new level of luxury. Whereas Four Seasons and other hotel companies largely lease out their (very nice) aircraft from outside vendors, Crystal’s parent company, Genting Hong Kong, is buying outright two Boeing planes—a custom-built 777 and a 
 that will follow down the line. The combined sticker price? $545 million. (Rodriguez declined to provide a figure but said the investment was “very sizable” and “very bullish.”)
Boeing 777s usually seat 350; this one will have just 84 lie-flat beds, a separate dining area with an on-board chef, a full wine cellar, and the highest staff-to-guest ratio anywhere in the skies. Its first trip, created in partnership with 
, departs Aug. 31 and hits all 10 cities where the Asian hotelier has properties, from Los Angeles, to Beijing, to Paris.
“We’re extending the Peninsula experience into the actual jet,” said Robert Cheng, Peninsula’s group vice president of marketing, who described how general managers will join travelers on flights to their hotel’s destination, offering up their local expertise well ahead of check-in. Also part of the deal are special galas and events that put travelers in contact with local movers and shakers: gallery owners, designers, chefs, and other people who “make a city tick on a global scale.”
Cheng put it best: “It’s not these people’s first times in these global gateways, so our goal is to make the trip interesting, not just by the things they do but by the people they meet.”
Naturally, that applies on the jet as well. “People want to mix and mingle with like-minded travelers,” said Holtz, who added that he “would not be surprised if some major business deals were formulated” aboard a party bus in the sky.
 
The advantages of flying private are obvious. “People want everything tied up with a bow,” said Crystal’s Rodriguez, who counts herself among travelers that like to be pampered. “You can’t get from the Tibetan Himalayas to the 
 rapidly or easily,” she said, referring to two consecutive stops on the Around the World tour. And while her 777 can’t land on Agra’s tiny airstrip, it’ll take guests to New Delhi, where a smaller (private) aircraft will whisk guests to the iconic monument.
On safari, taking out a small Embraer or Pilates jet allows guests with 
 and 
 to guarantee they’ll sidestep airport chaos, make it to their next destination in time for a game drive, and get their full allotment of luggage space—never a sure thing on safari. (Small safari planes often act like shuttles, picking guests up and dropping guests off on roundabout, unpredictable circuits.)
But why fly private if you’re not doing it privately? The answer is simple: economies of scale. On most of these trips, customs officers can come aboard the aircraft and process passports without anyone ever stepping foot in an immigration line, said SmartFlyer’s Holtz. Staying with a single hotel company means you’ll tell them your preferences once and never remind them again. “You can have your favorite green juice at 7:00 a.m. in the morning sharp, no matter where you stay,” Holtz added as an example.
And then there are the exclusive experiences that simply can’t be arranged for just two people. “They’re able to use the volume and price point to their advantage,” said ultra-luxury travel specialist 
 of Ovation Travel. “A gala dinner in St. Petersburg’s Catherine Palace, for instance—you can’t plan that alone.”
Nor can you get 
 and the Noma team to curate your 
 … unless you’re on a Four Seasons jet. Or go wine tasting in Mendoza and Cape Town and France with an expert from 
 … unless you’re flying with Crystal. That’s why Peninsula’s Cheng says that even guests who already own private jets are signing up for these trailblazing new trips.
 
The most affordable of the private jet trips among these main players clocks in at $78,600, making any discussion of value a relative one. But Holtz points out that you could easily spend 20 percent to 30 percent more if you tried to plan a similar trip yourself. He’s not wrong: Business-class flights alone could cost roughly $25,000 per person on such an itinerary, not including the value of time spent on lengthy layovers or waiting in airport terminals.
And given the caliber of hotels on these itineraries—all among the best in the world—another $15,000 in overnights is not unrealistic. Add the cost of guides, drivers, meals, and booze—all of which is included on a curated trip—and it’s easy to see how the dollars and cents add up.
But there are exceptions. Aman’s 
 start at about $55,000 for a 16-day wellness quest in the South Pacific led by world-renowned specialists Yamuna Zake and James D’Silva. The company also has the most expensive trips we found: Its Southeast Asia voyages, created in conjunction with the highly proficient tour operator Remote Lands, have been advertised for as much as $57,750 
(The company was unavailable to comment on the services and amenities travelers can expect at that rate.)
 
None of these companies is having a hard time selling out its trips. Four Seasons has a wait list for its late-2017 departures, which Smith says sold out in “record time.” Aman Chief Operating Officer Roland Fasel says he's been inspired to expand his program because the trips "are always a huge success and sell out very quickly." And Rodriguez says the Crystal jet has already garnered several buyouts, which both Ezon and Holtz estimated could cost somewhere in the $3 million range.
And who’s going? Ezon says the crowd is much like the group that shells out big bucks on cruising—older travelers with a bucket list to check off. But Holtz has a more generalist view, citing interest from business owners who just sold their startup, young couples who maybe hit it big on the market, or retirees with time and money. Crystal CEO Rodriguez sides with Holtz, saying half her bookings come from new-to-cruise market customers whom she hopes to convert into Crystal loyalists.
Either way, both agents agree the trend is here to stay. “It’s just in its infancy right now, but this is going to be a tremendous market,” said Holtz. “Our clients come back with great feedback. They say it’s one of the best trips they’ve ever taken.”

=== Title: How to do Antarctica in One Day - Bloomberg ===

In the earliest days of Antarctic tourism, making the expedition to the frozen continent was fit only for the most daring of adventure junkies—those who were willing to put their lives on the line, didn’t mind sleeping in the barracks of military-style icebreaker vessels, and had weeks to spend crossing treacherous waters. But recently, most of that has changed. Ships have become reliably safe, even luxurious, with famous mega-yacht 
making its debut voyages early this year. But no matter which way you spun it, heading to the globe’s southern extremes has pretty much always necessitated a time commitment.
No more. Bespoke operator 
 has been taking requests for single-day trips to Antarctica—and delivering unforgettable experiences on that short timetable. The key, said Alex Malcolm, Jacada’s founder and managing director, is eliminating the time-consuming (and often choppy) ocean crossing and heading south by air instead.
Passengers on Malcolm’s single-day trips board a King Air 300 twin-turboprop plane in Puntas Arenas, Chile, which gets them to Antarctica in two hours, rather than two days. Feasibility studies are still under way on how to get larger planes to land on the continent; between iced-over runways and concerns about environmental impact, arriving by air is still a rare endeavor. (Another company, 
, leads daylong sightseeing flights to the continent from Australia, but they never touch down.)
Filling a day in Antarctica is the easy part. A stop at Collins Glacier, one of the region’s most dramatic sites, is a must—its towering walls of blue ice are bewildering in their proportions, and it’s home to a variety of endemic wildlife that includes leopard and elephant seals, whales, and more. Then it’s off to one of the continent’s strangest sites: Trinity Church, a Russian Orthodox institution built with wood shipped over from Siberia. (If you head in on a Sunday, you might catch a service by one of two priests who spend time on the continent each year.) Culminate with a Zodiac trip to Ardley Island, where you can see gentoo, chinstrap, and adelie penguins, or head to Antarctica’s first settlement, Villa Las Estrellas, where a sign shows you just how far you are from any other civilization on earth.
There is one caveat for daytrips to the most far-flung corner of the earth: Inclement weather can be a worse impediment here than anywhere else. In fact, there's a roughly one-in-five chance that a flight will be cancelled due to weather. For that reason, Malcolm recommends that guests include a quick hop to Antarctica as one element of a longer Patagonia trip to allow for some flexibility (
 runs roughly $12,000 per person). But Antarctica was always meant for daredevils, anyway.
 
 

=== Title: Nissan’s 2017 ‘Godzilla’ Roars at the New York Auto Show - Bloomberg ===

Nissan unveiled the latest version of its halo car, the Nissan GT-R, Wednesday at the 
. The early debut is expected to be one of the 
 of the auto show. 
This is the latest update to the two-door, 2+2 sports car the company unveiled in 2007. Nissan had wanted a car that could compete against the likes of the Audi R8, BMW M6, Chevy Corvette, and Porsche 911 but that would cost significantly less than those. 
"This is the best GT-R in Nissan's history," Keno Kato, Nissan head of product development, told press at the debut. 
To back up his claim, the new model gets 565 horsepower on its 3.8L twin-turbo V6 engine, a 20-hp improvement over its predecessor and the most horsepower on the standard model of any car in its class. The engine is hand-assembled by one of five master craftsman, called 
, at Nissan's plant in Yokohama, Japan. 
The new model has a new set of four rounded tail lights amid redone rear bodywork, freshly angled headlights, a sharper new grille, a new hood, and updated refined air intakes that give it a snarling grin. It has also been refined for improved stability and aerodynamics.
 
Inside, the interior has been upgraded, with higher-quality Nappa leathers, new steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, revised front seat design, and a simplified switch layout, plus NissanConnectSM with Navigation, Mobile Apps, and ServicesNissan. An eight-inch touch-panel monitor replaces the seven-inch one from last year and now features large icons on the display screen, while a new display command control on the carbon-fiber center console is meant to allow easier operation. Nissan also introduced a new "Blaze Metallic" (burnt orange) color for the 2017 model. A total-remake successor is in planning for launch in a few years.
The 2017 Nissan GT-R hits dealerships this summer. Pricing has yet to be announced.

=== Title: 10 Truly Remote Places Where Your Boss Can’t Track You Down - Bloomberg ===

When the weather is bad and days are short, workers can feel especially cooped up in the office—and bogged down in constant contact with other human beings. All the more reason to choose a vacation destination that is so remote and so untouched by modernity that you will feel truly alone. At these 10  places, there's no Wi-Fi or bad cell reception, and there's very few other humans. So go ahead and turn on that “out of office and into the wild” notification. 
 
Don’t assume that 
 is high-tech just because of its cutting-edge architecture. Staying here means zero cell phone signal or Wi-Fi in the rooms—which are wall-to-wall blonde wood and hand-crafted furnishings. Consider it a benefit rather than a drawback; it’ll allow you to focus completely on the stunning Patagonian landscape and the Torres del Paine peaks in the distance. 
 
Most luxury camps in Africa offer Wi-Fi, even in the tents. But 
—owned by the legendary guide Ralph Bousfield and set deep in the Kalahari salt pans—is guaranteed to keep your cell phone off and your wildlife game on. The only downside to your data blackout? Not being able to post those cute meerkat photos until you get home. 
 
One helpful staff member of the romantic 
, near tiger-filled Pench National Park in India, told us that if we really wanted cell phone reception, we'd have to drive a bit, then get out of the car and hold the phone high up in the air. “But watch out for curious cats while trying!” He said. We politely passed on his offer and cozied up with a G&T under the giant baobab tree to watch the stars. 
 
Pack your binoculars, not your laptop, if you’re heading to 
 on Vancouver Island. Mandatory seaplane transfers mean that light packing is mandatory, and there’s no cell phone reception or Wi-Fi once you land. Only bears. Lots and lots of bears. Upstairs are simple, yet comfortable rooms—all brand-new, with views of the water and wilderness reserve. Downstairs, home-cooked meals and free-flowing local wine are the perfect counterweight to days in the wild. 
 
The moment you finally lose your diminishing 3G in the northern Chubut region of Argentinean Patagonia, you know you are in for a treat. Here in Bahia Bustamante, you’ll find a former seaweed-harvesting village and estancia that has been turned into 
, with a handful of fishermen’s cottages that now serve as delightful hotel rooms with panoramic Atlantic views. Go watch penguins, whales, and sea lions around the protected, privately owned peninsula on which the estancia is located—knowing the only reason to bring your phone is for cute super-slow-mo videos. 
 
The graceful lady of the house, Athena McAlpine, doesn’t want to install Wi-Fi in her amazing, one-of-a-kind 
 in Puglia, hidden deep in the south of Italy. And why should she? The home is practically a museum, filled with tribal art pieces and eccentricities collected from around the world. Phone service is also a no-go: The centuries-old, meter-thick walls of this former monastery prevent any cell phone signal from entering. It’s the perfect excuse to relax in the lounge chairs at the pool, a glass of Italian rosé in hand—all courtesy of your eccentric hostess. 
 
Even in the capital of this spirited Indian region, located 11,000 feet high in the Himalayas, the internet can cut out for days (or weeks) at a time. 
 makes that feel glamorous: It was once a royal palace, and now has three rooms and five luxurious tents with access to ancient-feeling apple and apricot orchards. Tune out. Or go on a trek through stunningly serene Ladakh. Nobody will find you, either way.  
 
The views of the azure-blue lagoon from your room’s wooden deck are begging to be Instagrammed. But that’s not possible on 
 a private island, all-villa retreat in Vanuatu. You won’t care, though: This barefoot luxury hideaway is more secret and more exclusive than any resort in well-trod Bora Bora or crowd-packed Fiji. 
 
The most magical way to reach this old and delightful pension is on foot (with your luggage towed separately in a speedy 4x4 Fiat Panda). Johanna, the eccentric owner of 
, has preserved the character of this inn by not adding any modern luxuries—forcing you to focus on the nature outside. With startling Tyrolian mountain peaks on view from your private balcony, that’s no problem at all. 
 
You’ll say “out of office” like you really mean it the moment you zip out of Ulaanbaatar’s city limits and into rural Mongolia. Stay in a comfortable camp such as 
—which has 14 well-appointed tents, many with private showers and wooden stoves—and spend some time with the nomads who live here. Switching off has never felt so Zen. Days are spend hiking the Khan Khentii protected wilderness park in which the camp is located, fishing in the nearby Upper Tuul River, or riding horses with the nomads.

=== Title: Mexico Travel Ideas for 2017, From Tulum to Los Cabos and Beyond - Bloomberg ===

So ... Mexico. 
At the very time that U.S. President Donald Trump doubles down on his promises to build a wall dividing his nation from its neighbor to the south, and Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto grapples with his response, Mexico is experiencing a boom in luxury tourism that has made it an appealing destination for travelers from America and beyond. 
The west coast has remained blissfully Zika-free, and new resorts (and resort towns) are sprouting up in many corners of the nation. René Redzepi is bringing his acclaimed Nordic restaurant Noma to Tulum. And smaller towns scattered throughout are seeing a burst of tourism, centered on authentic experiences that tend to revolve around tequila and tacos. Pay attention to your 
 and stick to areas with trusted hospitality and travel providers, and you'll find that now is an excellent time to visit Mexico.
And if you do, here are the most exciting places to go:
 
One of Mexico’s finest eating towns will soon be home to a stunning, 78-room 
 the first luxury hospitality venue in town. Set to open this spring, the hotel is taking shape in a collection of historic buildings around the city’s main square, with a courtyard that includes a 300-year-old chapel and an al fresco restaurant. Expect loads of local Talavera pottery—one of several traditional crafts on display—and the kind of impeccable service found at Rosewood’s other Mexico resorts. One key difference? The price tag. Whereas a night at 
 in Los Cabos might run you upwards of $1,000, rooms at Rosewood Puebla will start at just $250. Plan a pit stop at the boutique hotel 
 while you’re there—they’ll teach you how to make a mean mole poblano.
 
Cash in on the 
 at 
, a new property two and a half hours south of Puerto Vallarta, where you rent all six master bedrooms from $8,000 per night. It’s not quite a villa, per se: The rooms are spread across four adobe-style casitas on more than a mile of private coastline. Included are 12,000 square feet of shared indoor space, including a massive entertainment room, plus 11,500 square feet of outdoor space, with an infinity-edge pool and a thatched-roof dining pavilion. Not traveling with a group? Head to 
 instead; the legendary palace on top of a jungle cliff was created by the same management company that's running Las Rosadas and has just added four signature suites—each is like a Moorish palace unto itself (from $1,300). And it's all about to be more easily accessible than ever, too, thanks to improved highway access and an airport opening in Jalisco late this year.
 
In case you missed it, Mexico’s 
 opened last fall. The 30 suites hover directly above the Caribbean Sea’s turquoise waters, with butler service and glass-framed cutouts in the floor (so you can spot colorful fish even if it’s raining outside). But since we last reported on them, demand has pushed up prices—the bungalows now run $950 per person, all-inclusive, making them some of the most expensive rooms on Mexico’s east coast. For something less pricey, try the new 
, a new, all-inclusive concept that’ll incorporate everything from cooking classes to unlimited golfing (from $207 per person).
 
Mexico gets a lot more attention for its booze and beaches than anything else, so it may surprise you to hear about wellness resorts here. But 
 marries the best of both worlds. It’s near Merida, one of the most colorful and culinary-focused towns in the Yucatán, with an extensive 
 that looks pulled out of the set of 
. The treatments borrow from mystical Mayan rituals: There are three 
 (natural sinkholes) whose waters are said to have healing powers and a sweat lodge for traditional ceremonies. But this is hardly an ascetic place. The resort also claims to have the world’s largest private tequila collection (from $1,040).
 
The trailblazing chef René Redzepi drew thousands of foodies to Sydney when he moved Noma there last year, creating a pop-up version of his restaurant that drew on the local ingredients. This year, he’s doing the same thing in Tulum. With tickets that run $600 a head, it’s luxury dining on a level not seen before in this barefoot-boho beach town—though Redzepi 
 he’ll be far from the first to put ants on the menu here. (They were shockers in both Copenhagen and Sydney but fit right into Mexican cuisine.) And since you’re already eating in the most glamorous restaurant in town, book a hotel that matches the mood. The fashion-forward 
 just got a makeover and expansion, and its 24 rooms are all decked out with highlights from the owner’s art collection—think original Picassos, Warhols, and Boteros (from $615).
 
You never really need a new reason to go to Cabo (it’s one of our 
), but here’s one anyway—the 60-room and 32-villa 
, opening Feb. 1 from the Auberge Resorts team (from $675). It’s Cabo’s first luxury hotel for adventure lovers, with a rare swimmable beach (the waters in the area can be extremely dangerous), access to a marine sanctuary, and a water sports shack that includes stand-up paddle boards and kayaks. They’ll also arrange for whale watching in Magdalena Bay, a secluded spit of sand where you can have an up-close-and-personal experience in total seclusion.
 
If you stay in the up-and-coming art capital of Guadalajara, where the year-old 
 is drawing an unlikely group of well-heeled travelers, you can hire the 
 to take you to—you guessed it—Tequila (from $134). A day of tastings is all you need in the agave-filled region, and you won’t have to worry about choosing a designated driver or navigating the country roads. Want to stay the night? Pick 
, a Relais & Châteaux property with 93 simple rooms, each with references to colonial Mexican décor (from $129).
 
While Rosewood and One&Only develop properties in an area near Puerto Vallarta called Mandarina—which we’ll call the next Cabo—Holbox is already establishing itself as the next Tulum. It’s a tiny, ultra-lush island off the coast of the Riviera Maya, just a 20-minute ferry ride from the little village of Chiquilla. But Holbox has flown largely under the radar until recently. A spate of pretty, low-slung hotels is bringing in discerning travelers (just look at 
 and 
, and you’ll see why). Trust us, this gem won’t be hidden much longer.
 
Let’s face it. Mexico City is racing to the top of travelers’ priority lists, not least 
. The latest hotel opening comes courtesy of Small Luxury Hotels of the World: the 
, with 55 rooms at the edge of Paseo de la Reforma and the Financial Zone (from $187). But while you’re there, check out the splashy, two-year-old 
—it has an excellent collection of Impressionist paintings—or 
, a pool hall that’s been converted into gallery space for up to 10 cutting-edge contemporary artists at a time. But make sure to get out of town, too. You can now 
 over the pre-Hispanic pyramids of Teotihuacan for an unforgettable half-day excursion.

=== Title: Uniworld, Disney, Avalon Give River Cruising an Adventurous Twist - Bloomberg ===

The standard river cruise goes something like this: You’re on a convivial ship with fewer than 200 passengers seeing the sights of inland Europe while enjoying nice digs, good food, organized group tours, wine and beer with meals, and free Wi-Fi. Much is preplanned and prepaid. All good, if you’re happy to travel at a slow pace with the senior set.
That relaxed river-cruising model is headed out the porthole, though. New on the scene are bold new adventure-themed itineraries: guided runs through Amsterdam, biking around Bavarian castles, dancing to celebrity DJs, and kayaking down the Seine. As for the nice digs, good food, and copious wine and beer? They’re staying put, of course.
Leading the charge is U by Uniworld, which makes its debut next year with Danube and Rhine itineraries that go heavy on adventure.
“If I had a crystal ball, I would predict right now that we’re probably going to end up with people between the ages of 27 and 35,” says Ellen Bettridge, chief executive officer of Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection Inc. Her argument: Visiting four countries in one week is the perfect lure for young professionals who are hungry to see the world. “They are seeking that vacation to have an opportunity to hang out with new people, new cultures.”
 happens to share a parent company with Contiki, the go-to for younger travelers (age 18 to 35). In focus groups and surveys, river cruises proved they could be attractive to young, wealthy travelers. It’s the same crowd that could stay at luxury hotels but chooses hostels instead for the camaraderie, says Bettridge. “So we’re creating this great place for them to meet and connect.”
They aren’t the only ones. Here are the best of the bunch—along with the itineraries to know.
A new partnership with biking tour operator 
 ramps up the action factor on Scenic, an Australian cruise line that puts the focus on all-inclusive luxury. (Booze is included, for instance.) Rhine and Danube voyages take place on 169-passenger ships, with daily bicycle rides stretching as long as 50 miles, though they’re broken up with visits to local wineries and breweries. After climbs of up to 3,000 feet, call on your butler to draw you a scented bath in your palatial suite.
 
 
Disney fans of all ages are booking cruises on the Danube and Rhine with 
, which charters new 158-passenger ships from California-based river line AmaWaterways, aimed at more than just the under-18 set. Sure, the atmosphere is lively, with Disney guides supplying hand-holding and occasional silliness. But the tour roster includes zip lining and horseback riding. Seven 
 cruises down the Rhine feature dinner dishes that may be familiar to fans of the movie (Beef ragout! Cheese soufflé!), special French châteaux-inspired décor, and a visit to the French village that claims to be the inspiration for Belle’s hometown in the film. Disney also offers a few adults-only culinary cruises that focus on wine or beer.
 
 
 has long offered city tours by bike in its ports of call—now it’s added fast-paced hiking tours and a robust wellness program. On Paris-based sailings aboard the 148-passenger 
, guests have access to an instructor who leads runs onshore as well as onboard yoga and Pilates classes. Detox with fruit- or rose quartz-infused waters in the main lounge and green smoothie shots at breakfast. Kristin Karst, executive vice president and co-owner of AmaWaterways, says the line attracts a good number of young honeymooners and that its wine-tasting cruises, hosted by California vintners, also draw a younger crowd. “You’ve done Napa—now you can do it on a ship,” Karst says.
 
AmaLyra
 
 is launching next spring on two refurbished 116-passenger river ships to head down the Seine, Rhine, and Danube. With mixologists and local celebrity DJs on board, the experience promises to feel more like a floating nightclub, with an extra charge for all booze. A cafe and bar on the sun deck are decorated with beanbag chairs, sun beds, and hammocks, while the main lounge is getting remodeled to feature an expanded dance floor. Friends can book triple cabins, and solo travelers can get paired with a roommate to save a few bucks. Overnights in some cities allow for still more nightlife excursions, while tours such as brewery-hopping in Amsterdam and kayaking outside Paris will be scheduled later in the day for those who want to sleep in.
 
 
Colorado-based 
 has just introduced Active Discovery itineraries on the 
 and 
, both of which carry 138 passengers, where hiking and biking tours are just the start. On the excursion lists: mountain climbing in Salzburg, running through the streets of Vienna, and river canoeing from Spitz, Austria. The trips premiered this year on the Danube but will expand to the Rhine next year. Not into such exertion? The line also draws a younger crowd on its occasional beer-themed cruises through the Netherlands and Belgium.
 

=== Title: Someone Is Selling a $9 Million 1967 ‘Ferrari’ Thomassima on EBay - Bloomberg ===

It’s not exactly a barn find. It’s far, far more impressive than that. But it’s listed among the dustiest jalopies you’d find in any back shed.
A Dallas-based seller has listed a 1967 Ferrari Thomassima II on his EBay 
 for the starting price of $9 million.
The user, under the name 
, did not respond to requests for comment, but it’s safe to say his car is the sole Thomassima model on private display. Only three were made: Thomassima I was destroyed in a flood, and Thomassima III sits in the Ferrari museum in Modena, Italy.
The series is special, not only for of its stunning good looks but because it was designed by an American, a man from California named 
. (
means “the most from Thomas.”) Meade was known to be heavily influenced by the period's Maserati aesthetic, evident in this car's curves.
Jonathan Klinger, the spokesman for Hagerty, said the high price of the Thomassima II is undoubtedly linked to the current strength of the Ferrari market. In 2006, the average price of a Ferrari in excellent condition was around $900,000. As of last month, that value had reached $5.5 million. Others have gone for more than $20 million and $30 million.
So don’t expect this one to be as important, in the grand scheme of things, as those 250s that go for multi-millions at 
. The Thomassima was built with Ferrari mechanics, but it was never officially produced by the brand.
“This is a special car that was built in-period with Ferrari mechanicals,” Klinger said. “Many people love its looks, and it will have a place at many shows. However, it should not be confused with a production Ferrari or a documented raced Ferrari.”
Phil Skinner, the collector-car senior market editor for Kelley Blue Book, agreed.
“It may have Ferrari running gear, be painted red (the most popular color at Ferrari), have some exotic mechanics and suspension, and even have a photo of Enzo Ferrari standing next to it, but it isn’t a real Ferrari,” Skinner said. “As for its $9,000,000 price tag, I would think that is wishful thinking." 
A “real” Ferrari must have a Ferrari-issued chassis number. While this car has a title calling it a Ferrari, it seems to be lacking such credibility, Skinner said. Serious buyers might expect to find a car of this supposed caliber at an auction house such as Gooding & Co., Bonham’s, or RM/Sotheby’s. Those firms could market the car, once they had verified its authenticity and backstory. 
“I just don’t see this particular car being that highly sought after,” he said.
At any rate, Kennedy apparently used Red Car Restorations of Rockwall, Tex., to return Thomassima II to mint condition, including coating it completely in a new paint job and installing a new, V12 engine of the type found in the Ferrari 250 GTO. The EBay post claims it’s the first one up for sale since 1983.
 
 

=== Title: A Road Trip to South Pole Is the Coolest New Adventure - Bloomberg ===

Looking for the next great undiscovered drive? What about driving so far south, you actually hit the South Pole?
Come November, you can make it happen on a roughly two-week-long road trip across Antarctica with 
. 
 
Sound intrepid? That’s just the start. Travelers will have a chance to hike Antarctica’s highest mountain, Mt. Vinson (it clocks in at 10,000 feet); cross-country ski across the tundra; and locate the point on the Earth where all 24 time zones meet and time loses all conventional meaning. And if all the stars align, you can even try to break the world record for the fastest Antarctic crossing.
It’s all part of two exclusive trips that accommodate no more than six travelers a piece—at a price tag of $165,000 per person.
“These sorts of things just don’t get done, and that’s what makes it so special,” said Nicola Shepherd, owner and director of Explorations Company, whose forte is in linking travelers with world-class conservationists in the world’s wildest corners, such as Botswana and India. Here in Antarctica, it's climate researchers whom she's connected with—and who originated these frozen voyages.
Weather is just the first of many challenges. (The temperatures can easily hover around minus 50 degrees.) Since passengers need at least 10 days to complete the driving circuit to the South Pole and back, it's unappealing to take a slow ship to get to Antarctica itself.
Instead, guests fly in on a Russian Ilyushin-76 jet. It looks “a bit like the grim reaper” on the outside, joked Shepherd, but it’s by far the most comfortable way to cross the Strait of Magellan. By the time the aircraft lands on Antarctica’s iced-over runway, a fleet of specialized 6x6 trucks await to begin the real journey.
The polar-adapted vehicles—a fleet of 19 retrofitted Toyota Hiluxes powered by a specially formulated, freeze-proof fuel—are the purview of 
, a company that has facilitated trips for 
 and British royalty. (Prince Harry used them on his 2013 South Pole charity trip for 
.)
The route follows the footsteps of 1950s explorer Sir Vivian Fuchs from the Ronne ice shelf to the Ross ice shelf. Only 23 people have ever completed the 1,150-mile-long crossing, and more than half of them were on Fuchs’s team.
To make things a little easier, Arctic Trucks provides specialized outerwear to keep travelers as appropriately dressed as possible. The crew includes a chef, who flies in enough ingredients to make meat-and-carb-heavy meals that power the day’s adventures. Champagne toasts are literally built into the itinerary. And although they don’t have running water, the mobile camps are well insulated and have private bathrooms with dry flush toilets—staffers will even put hot water bottles under your pillows to keep things nice and toasty.
But this isn’t a 
; this is the drive of your life. And while it’s expected to take 10 days from start to finish, you can never really know.
“Wind is the most detrimental factor,” said Shepherd. “Visibility can be zero on certain days. You can get snowed in. You’d have to stay in camp those days, play cards, and wait for the first clearing.”
“As much as this is sold as a tourist trip, it’s not a jolly old holiday—it’s an expedition,” explained Shepherd, who spoke to Bloomberg by phone from her headquarters in Gloucestershire, U.K. For each traveler in the convoy, there are about four staffers: medics, researchers, and local experts who are adept at navigating the all-white landscape. 
Travelers need to pass physical fitness evaluations to make sure they can handle the extreme conditions.
“People lose a lot of weight on these trips, just because your body is working so much harder to keep warm,” Shepherd explained, adding that none of the excursions would be considered physically demanding in any other climate.
So who’s the target audience? British fund managers and Swiss bankers have been the ones to book thus far.
“It’s not necessarily for extreme adventurers who have already climbed Kilimanjaro,” said Shepherd. “It’s more for people who have a fascination for Antarctica but don’t want to go on a great big ship with hundreds of people. Or for those who want to do something different to stretch themselves and understand their own great potential.”

=== Title: Osteria Francescana Is Named the World's Best Restaurant - Bloomberg ===

 was named the best eatery on the planet at the World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards, an annual tradition that has become beloved—if lightly regarded—in the culinary world.
, El Celler de Can Roca, dropped to second place, while Modena, Italy's Osteria Francescana won raucous applause for its win. 
, it's the first Italian restaurant to make it to No. 1.
Osteria Francescana is filled with artworks collected by Bottura, and the dishes reflect his love of artists such as Ai Weiwei and Wassily Kandinsky. They are colorful and exuberant, complex and fun—yet totally focused. His Caesar Salad in Emilia may look like naked lettuce, but hidden inside are 15 ingredients: the cheese in the form of crispy wafers; the eggs cured in salt and sugar and then air-dried until they are hard enough to grate; the tomatoes strained through cheesecloth for at least 12 hours.
The restaurants on the 2016 list were picked by a total of almost 1,000 members of the industry, including restaurateurs, chefs, writers, and gourmets. The group is divided into 27 regional panels, each with 36 members. They are asked to choose their seven "best restaurant experiences"—it's not a laurel based on food alone. The ceremony took place at Cipriani Wall Street in downtown Manhattan—the first time it has taken place outside of London since its founding in 2002.
In addition to the main awards, a few restaurants and chefs were specially recognized. 
 in Tokyo took the "One to Watch" award, presented to a restaurant identified as a "rising star" in global gastronomy and which made the Top 100 list for the first time. The World's Best Pastry Chef went to 
, the "Emperor of Macaroons" and "Picasso of Pastry," a fourth-generation baker who began his career at 14 and now runs an eponymous shop in Paris. 
 in Copenhagen moved up five spots to No. 40 and won "Best Sustainable Restaurant" for a second year in a row. And scooping up the "World's Best Female Chef" with her 
 is Dominique Crenn of the two-Michelin-starred 
 in San Francisco—which strangely didn't rank at all. Celebrated French chef Alain Passard of 
(No. 19) was recognized with the "Lifetime Achievement" award.
, under chef Daniel Humm, came fifth in 2015 after placing fourth in 2014. This year it moved up one spot more to No. 3—making it the top restaurant in North America. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it also won the show's first-ever "Art of Hospitality" award.
The last U.S. restaurant to triumph was The French Laundry, in 2004. Since then, European establishments have monopolized the top place.
The "Biggest Mover Award" this year went to 
 from Lima, which climbed 31 points to No. 13, and along with 
 at No. 4 further cements Peruvian cuisine's global ascendance—and its capital as a foodie destination. Past awards have struggled with diversity, so it's heartening to see restaurants outside Europe and America getting their due.
Other surprises included Heston Blumenthal's 
, which dropped precipitously from No. 7 in 2015 to 45th place, joining 
 (No. 74), which saw a similar drop. Notably, only two Parisian restaurants made the top 50 this year, a small but significant departure from tradition. Meanwhile in New York, local favorite 
 made the top 50 for the first time, while 
 dropped to No. 52 and 
 fell off the list altogether (it was No. 67 last year). So did 
, formerly No. 94.

=== Title: Driving a 1914 Model T Will Reteach You How to Use a Car: Video - Bloomberg ===

Starting in 1908, Henry Ford sold his novel Model T cars as the first to be really accessible to the masses. Priced at the time around $500 (he eventually got the price down to near $200, which is about $5,000 in today's dollars), they fell into a budget bracket that a farmer or a carpenter could afford.
What’s more, he marketed his cars as easy to drive—way more accessible to casual drivers and (gasp!) women since later models started with a button rather than a crank.
Thing is, those old Model Ts were still pretty complicated to drive.
I drove a 1914 Model T the other day on some back roads about an hour outside Detroit. Between the three floor pedals, meter-long emergency brake, steering wheel-mounted throttle, and electric jumper lever 
 on the steering wheel—not to mention the lack of power brakes/steering and the 12-degree temperatures—it renewed my respect for people who drove this contraption every day in harsh road and weather conditions. They don’t call driving one “doing the Model T dance” for nothing.
Here’s the gist of it: 
To move into second gear (around 10 mph or so), you let up the left pedal all the way toward you, past neutral, which is in the middle position between first gear and second. (Recall: Push all the way down for first, release it halfway for neutral, release it all the way for second.) With that hand-operated throttle and the push-down-for-first-gear setup, it’s kind of like riding a motorcycle.
So wait, wondering about that middle pedal? It's reverse. And the right foot pedal is the brake. You can brake at any point when driving, though if you do it too aggressively, you’ll stall out. But no matter, a quick hit of that electrical push button will start the whole thing again.
Once you get into second gear the rest of the car is automatic—you can accelerate all the way up to 45 mph or so. Cruising speed is closer to 20 mph.
Driving this Model T was more difficult than many of the 
 
 
. The throttle is touchy, and the pedals all have to be right in line in order to brake or to go in neutral. But, like most things, it just takes some time to get a feel for it.
Once you learn to cruise, the Model T clicks along quietly, and the four-cylinder, 20-horsepower engine feels like it has plenty of power (the car is mostly wooden and weighs less than 1,500 pounds, after all). Better yet, it’s rugged. With that high chassis, big rubber wheels, and forgiving suspension, driving through the January snow and mud doesn’t faze it at all.
There are idiosyncrasies, of course.
You have to get into and out of the car from the passenger-side door, since the driver door is blocked by the meter-long emergency brake. There is no power steering or braking. The horn is a literal brass
. There are no actual sides to the thing—later models had curtains that would unfurl to help keep in warmth, but otherwise these were open-air beasts. And the 10-gallon fuel tank lacks a gauge, so you must guess how far you’ve gone and assume you get about 20 miles to the gallon. (It lacks any gauges, for that matter.)
But if you find such quirks adorable rather than annoying, you’re in luck. Despite the fact that this car is 100 years old, it’s not especially rare. You should be able to find one on EBay or Craigslist for less than $10,000.
It’s not the easiest car I’ve driven, nor the most fun—and it's definitely more twee than stylish. But it is a tangible piece of history, one of the few icons you can still touch and operate and say, without a doubt, that this one changed the world. If you get the chance to drive one, take it. 

=== Title: Welcome Summer At New York's Best Outdoor Bars - Bloomberg ===

For most New Yorkers, simply escaping the city is a primary summer goal. But to get the quickest and easiest change of scenery, make a beeline for the rooftop bars and backyard gardens that burst into life once the mercury hits 75. Since they're not exactly in plain view,  we’ve rounded up the most impressive newcomers—along with mainstays you simply shouldn't miss—to kick off a season full of happy hours. These are not mere white-wine-and-sunshine joints; these bars serve serious cocktails from big-name mixologists.
 
Just across from McCarren Park is 
, the William Vale, opening in mid-July. On its 22
-floor rooftop: food and drinks run by Andrew Carmellini’s Noho Hospitality Group and a wraparound balcony with panoramic views of the city. Consider it a worthy alternative to the constantly packed 
 that’s right around the corner.
 
Over the past few summers, no rooftop bar could hold a candle to Eataly’s 14th-floor beer garden, Birreria. Now the same expansive space—with views of the Empire State and Flatiron buildings—has been reborn as 
, a pop-up inspired by the Italian Riviera. It resembles an upscale beach lounge, with deck chairs and cabanas, a seafood-heavy menu, and flights of craft beer served in a model boat. Order carafes of summer-friendly spritzes such as the Sorrento Spritz with mint, cucumber, lemon, and Prosecco. Oysters, which come courtesy of the Massachusetts-based specialists at Island Creek, are also a must. 
 
What's the next-best option to 
-sail drinks on a private yacht? Negronis aboard a historic wooden schooner. That’s what you’ll get at 
, a former cod fishing boat docked off Pier 25 in Tribeca. Behind the shipboard bar is Lauren Schell, formerly of the acclaimed Milk & Honey, mixing such drinks as the pomegranate-elderflower sparkling wine, “Locals Only.” You won’t go hungry, either: A menu of seafood-focused small plates comes courtesy of chef Kerry Heffernan, an avid fisherman and the opening executive chef at Eleven Madison Park.
 
From its beachy cabanas to its mini lobster rolls, 
 is a Midtown oasis that’s all about surf culture. The signature Frosé—a frozen rosé sorbet topped with pink bubbly—is a perfect day drink. (They’ve already coined the hashtag #froseallday.) And you’ll be able to handle more of them by staying hydrated; servers offer up coconut water from freshly cracked designer coconuts (yes, you read that right). The only things that could add to the allure: a salty breeze and breaking waves in the distance.
 
While some rooftop venues trade on location alone, there are rare top-floor bars whose craft cocktails are the equal of any in town. Such is the case at midtown's 
, run by respected Boston restaurateurs (and James Beard award-winners) Tim and Nancy Cushman. Beverage director Ted Kilpatrick’s drinks include intelligent takes on summer classics, such as the “Bitter Mai Tai” with Cappelletti and orgeat alongside two rums, the “Italian Greyhound” with bitter Punt e Mes and grapefruit, or the impossibly decadent Duke’s Martini: frozen Plymouth gin served with caviar.
 
This 
—known for nouveau-Peruvian cuisine by an Eleven Madison Park alum—has just launched a rooftop lounge that’s drawing big-time buzz. Just like chef Erik Ramirez, the bartenders have serious pedigrees: Jessica Gonzalez has done time at Death & Co., while Lynnette Marrero came from Rye House and Freeman’s. Their innovative cocktails use New World spirits (think pisco, rum, and tequila) and have clever names such as the “Dolly Llama,” made with Tempranillo, strawberries, and the Bolivian grape spirit, Singani 63.
 
The word “atmospheric” doesn’t begin to describe 
’s lush, straight-out-of-New Orleans backyard. Where better to spend a sultry summer night than seated at a wrought-iron table with lights twinkling overhead, a spread of ice-cold oysters on the table, and a sherry cobbler in hand? Here, the regularly-rotating cocktail menu is among the strongest in the city; recent highlights include the “Barber of Seville,” with rye, sherry, lemon, and orgeat, and the “Carondelet,” with Beefeater gin, citrus, blossom honey, and vanilla. The extensive Champagne list is icing on the cake.
 
Part art installation, part rooftop bar, 
 sits atop the McKittrick Hotel—the fictional Scottish inn better known for its resident theatrical production, 
. Fittingly, Gallow Green itself feels like a theater set, with an “abandoned” early 20th century railway car and deliberately overgrown landscaping. The atmosphere may feel put-on, but the drinks are the real deal: Get the “Charmed Life,” with gin, lemon, and bitter orange Montenegro.
 
 
The Viceroy Central Park’s 
 is a year-round favorite. Designed by Roman and Williams, its interior has the aesthetic of a sleek yacht, all walnut and leather and brass. But it’s never more alluring than in the summer, when you can sip a blood orange Veuve Clicquot spritz or a jalapeño margarita, with Central Park in sight.

=== Title: Four Seasons’ Private Jet Review: First Look Inside Newly Branded 757 - Bloomberg ===

Spending three weeks touring the world’s wonders and staying in five-star hotels is better by private jet—right?
Well, naturally. But the Four Seasons is hoping that up to 52 passengers will pay $119,000 each for the round-the-world honor on their shiny new plane. Before it took off on its maiden voyage (a shorter 16-day “
” tour round Europe’s highlights), we snuck aboard at Paris's Le Bourget airport to get a first look at the multimillion-dollar conversion and find out just how it's seeking to change the face of luxury group tours.
Let’s make this clear: The Four Seasons’ jet is no Gulfstream—it’s a reconfigured Boeing 757-200ER leased by TCS World Travel (a luxury tour operator) from TAG Aviation (which provides pilots, maintenance) and operated under the Four Seasons flag as an entrée to extravagant group excursions. And it looks downright sexy in its new shade of metallic black.
The interior went from 233 standard-size seats to 52 lie-flat seats in a 2-by-2 configuration. Each seat stretches 6.5 feet, with ample aisle and legroom, and offers 78 inches of personal space. Overhead bins are nearly double their original size (now fitting 189 bags) but take up less headspace by tucking up into the crown of the fuselage. A new bi-color LED lighting system creates a 
 in shades of violet white and soft blues.
TCS’s president Shelley Cline declined to disclose specific financial details but noted that a typical commercial refit would cost around $15 million—and this was not a typical refit. “To meet the service and design standards of the Four Seasons, we have done significantly more work,” she wrote via e-mail. 
Four Seasons has been offering private jet experiences with TCS since 2012, but it’s the first private jet 
, giving them much more control over service and logistics than they had chartering other people’s planes.
The idea is to apply the famous service standards of their hotels at 35,000 feet.
There are, at minimum, 21 hotel-trained crew and staff on board each Four Seasons flight, including three pilots, two engineers, a "journey manager" (travel coordinator), a concierge, and an executive chef. A physician and a photographer also come along, when adventurous itineraries—such as diving the Maldives' coral reefs or game watching in the Serengeti—require it.
Itineraries are planned to avoid long hauls. On around-the-world tours, flight times range from 3.5 hours to 8 hours, with an average of 6 hours, excluding short "hopper flights," such as Istanbul to Ephesus or Mumbai to Agra. Essentially it’s an all-first shuttle from one Four Seasons resort property to the next, shielding you from ever having to manage a single travel hassle yourself. All accommodation, meals, drinks, ground transportation, and even custom excursions are inclusive.
"I've been in prettier jets and smaller jets," Patricia Davidson, a guest on the jet's inaugural tour. She regularly charters Sunwest and NetJets but points to the guest services here as the selling point. "Visas, insurance, and itineraries were all organized with swift precision. No request went unanswered—and they were kind, respectful and playful."
That playfulness is apparent when meeting executive chef Kerry Sear, who considers the jet his restaurant in the sky.
Four Seasons chefs at the hotels provide local ingredients, which are cooked fresh in the air with an aviation-code steam oven. (Typical commercial jet-style convection ovens can only reheat, leading to typically 
.) Sear chats to guests during the flights and learns their preferences, then coordinates with chefs on the ground to make sure patrons get what they want in the air.
"I have to do something cool for this level of luxury—which is really all about choice," saya the chef, who was previously F&B director at Four Seasons Seattle. With his salt-and pepper goatee and humble demeanor, you kind of want to have a beer with him. And guests do. "I had a guy who just preferred Coors Light, even though we serve these lovely wines. So we stocked the plane for him, and we had a few. Why not, if it makes him happy?"
On the upscale à la carte menu, Petrossian caviar and Dom Pérignon champagne are anytime staples. But surprise dishes rotate, depending on your itinerary. Just returning from Kona, Hawaii? You might have fresh lobster salad sprinkled with macadamia nuts. Just made friends with elephants in Thailand? A dark chocolate elephant is on board waiting to greet you. It’s “airplane food” as much as typical in-flight snacks are smoked salmon canapés, fresh fruit kebabs with passion fruit sauce, or pristine petit fours.
Sleep. That ever elusive siren, for which travelers will pay obscene amounts, seems achievable on beautifully constructed, white leather seats. 
(Sadly, I didn’t actually get to join these high-flyers on their European adventure—corporate policy doesn’t permit that sort of thing—but my Le Bourget tarmac tour provided hands-on intel.)
The seats are designed by 
, a favorite Italian craftsman also found aboard Lear, Gulfstream, and Cathay Pacific jets, and the seats slide smoothly and quietly from sitting upright to lying flat at a touch of a button (clearly marked on a personal control panel). Tray tables are topped in dark shellacked wood, with a roomy surface that can easily handle a heavy laptop or formally set, three-course meal. Against the white of the plane, the wood gives the interior a kind of high-speed yacht feel.
Yet somewhat disappointingly, there is no partition or privacy to protect you from unwanted chit-chat—or snoring from the robber baron next door. With two seats on each side of the aisle, these are not the enclosed enclaves of Air France's 
 class or Etihad's 
.
In fact, the ethos here is more communal in general. There may not be purpose-made social areas, such as an 
, but with three pilots on board, one is always free to chat with guests, as they are with each other. Flying with Four Seasons is a choice to meet, socialize, and share adventures with new people.
"We didn’t sleep much on the flights, because we were always having much too much fun drinking champagne and giving our neighbors nicknames,” said passenger Davidson. An interior designer from Calgary, she booked the trip to celebrate her 55th birthday and wound up forging new friendships. "We loved our space and all of the people who were surrounding us."
When you take your seat, you'll find serious stash: Bvlgari toiletry kit, cashmere blanket, Bose noise-canceling headphones, and a custom-made leather travel journal by Moleskin with matching ballpoint pen. Each guest also receives an iPad Air 2 in advance of the trip, on which you can preload music and movies as a personalized entertainment system. They’re all yours to keep.
Best part: There’s free Wi-Fi—unlike the actual hotel properties you’ll sleep at. High-speed isn’t guaranteed, but guests can visit any website and send e-mails; they just can’t stream video content while on board to ensure a good connection. (Instead, a select library of both new and contemporary films and TV shows is available to download.) Taking the tech-forward cue from newer planes, the in-flight entertainment here is as good as any.
As for the toiletries, Bvlgari is a Four Seasons favorite. And rightly so; the "au thé vert" body lotion has a very light perfume and a heavy, smooth consistency.
Women’s kits come in a white bag and include hand cream, lip balm, refreshing towels, face emulsion cleanser, hand sanitizer, breath mints, and a dental kit. The men's kits, in black, are essentially the same with the addition of aftershave balm and gel. Each comes with a soft and pillowy black-and-gold sleeping mask, as well.
The kits are small, though—even if reportedly costing $100 each—and provided twice, once at the beginning and then halfway through the journey, instead of on each leg. Run out of dental floss? An additional supply is always available. Just don’t leave your own supplies at home.
The cozy, fullsize Mongolian cashmere blanket almost makes up for this slight, but it's such a bright shade of orange, it will either keep you awake or invariably clash with your outfit.
Unlike the epic five-star commodes you can expect on the ground, the four bathrooms on board are coach-class tiny. As bright and clean, custom-designed, and suffused with Bvlgari green tea air freshener they may be, there was no wow moment here. Also a tick in the “con” column: paper towels instead of cloth. Not a big deal in the grand scheme, sure, but it’s the small details that really send luxury over the top.
"We are obsessed with space and giving our guests as much as possible. Even the most luxurious private jet has only so much room to work with," explained Dana Kalczak, Four Seasons' vice president for design.
True, there are limits. Namely: aviation law.
Four Seasons’ 757 is a commercial jet as far as airport regulators are concerned, which means you're lucky if you get to board this plane from a swank private landing and can strut like James Bond straight on to the tarmac. Pilots land in smaller civilian airports—avoiding mammoths such as Heathrow—wherever possible. So in Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Mumbai, guests are golden; Sydney and Tokyo, not so much.
If a private airport isn’t possible, Four Seasons arranges for expedited security lanes, and the jet is ready for boarding as soon as you clear security. So there’s no need to arrive three hours early and hit the lounge like the rest of us plebs (which may or may not be a benefit 
).
Flying the Four Seasons jet, you’re also still bound by those 3-1-1 no-big-liquids carry-on commercial security rules, which renders the spaciously redesigned overhead bins a little moot.
Sure you don’t have to be shy about bringing that Louis Vuitton trunk—this plane can handle it—but you still need to check bags. For the risk-averse, that’s worth noting, even if we can't imagine an item going missing.
These less-than-luxe details, however, aren't stopping guests from booking. The next 
, scheduled in August—nine stops from Seattle to New York via Asia—is already sold out. Next year, the 24-day itinerary jumps to $132,000.

=== Title: The Eight Rules of Booking a Wildlife Vacation, Safari - Bloomberg ===

 in Mexico. Gorilla trekking in Rwanda. 
. Animals motivate us to make pilgrimages to the ends of the earth, filling our bucket lists and our Instagram feeds in equal measure.
When carried out responsibly, travel can help ensure the future of these awe-inspiring creatures and their habitats. But too often, thoughtless or downright opportunistic operators put financial gain above sustainability, leading to such stories as last week’s 
, with monks in Thailand (yes, monks) accused of perpetuating terrible animal cruelty for tourist-driven fun and games. The rise in app-induced "road rage" in 
 feels tame by comparison.
Here’s the silver lining: Luxurious and fulfilling wildlife trips often go hand-in-hand. In fact, luxury travel fuels some of the world’s most ambitious conservation projects. The next time you’re heading into the wild, be part of the solution by following these rules of thumb.
 
“A good guideline is to avoid tours that promise hands-on encounters with wild animals,” said David Emmett, a senior vice president at 
. Many of these operators remove animals from their original habitats—often separating them from their packs and uprooting their social dynamics. Even when animals are kept in their habitats, interacting with humans can throw off their natural behavior and make them more susceptible to threats in the wild.
 
Particularly if you’re traveling abroad, avoid venues that keep animals in enclosures, such as those you’d find in a zoo. “In the developing world, you simply don’t have the resources to create environments for captive animals to thrive,” explained Jim Sano, vice president of travel, tourism, and conservation for the 
, which says these animals are often mistreated. Instead search out places that let the figurative (
) buffalo roam.
 
Good news: It 
 possible to have interactions with wildlife that are both close-up and completely kosher. “Look for ones that house animals that can’t be reintroduced into the wild and where the animals are being cared for diligently,” said Leigh Henry, a senior conservation policy advisor with the World Wildlife Fund. Opening these sanctuaries to tourism “can sometimes ensure that resources are available to care for those animals,” she explained.
For instance, at 
, a Wilderness Safaris property in Botswana’s Okavango Delta, safari-goers are encouraged to take savannah walks with a herd of rescued elephants or help give them baths. The property’s website offers backstories for each member of the herd; it also offers entire pages dedicated to elephants it has successfully reintroduced into the wild. Here, conservation and animal welfare are twin priorities.
 
So how do you find properties like Abu that get it right? While there isn’t yet a certification program for the tourism industry that undergoes regular audits, several organizations will point you in the right direction. Jennifer Morris, chief operating officer for Conservation International, is partial to 
. “Their standards emphasize sustainability and responsible environmental practices that don’t harm animals or the planet—as well as sound social and economic practices that are good for people,” she said. (So far, the program focuses on Central America and South America.) The team at WWF maintains a global list of preferred travel operators called 
; Henry and Sano also recommend tours that have received a seal of approval from the UN-endorsed 
.
 
Every expert we spoke with agreed: breeding centers are dangerously misleading. According to famous conservationist Gregory Carr, who has spearheaded the rehabilitation of Mozambique’s 
, places that “claim they are breeding wildlife for reintroduction, or are acting as sanctuaries" are often just “baby animal factories for tourists.” Chris Roche, chief marketing officer for 
, put it quite simply: “Unscrupulous breeders use tourism as an additional revenue stream for their activities.” And WWF’s Henry agreed. “There are a handful of zoos that have credible conservation breeding programs,” she said, “but many outside of the U.S. are really breeding for financial gain, regardless of what they claim.”
 
Operators that prioritize conservation don’t usually make a habit of hiding it. That’s why Sano recommends going to a company’s website and seeing how much information it provides beyond the price and dates of itineraries.
Nothing there? “Depending upon the resort, there are all sorts of questions a traveler can ask that may not necessarily have to do with wildlife,” said Carr. You can take the temperature for a place’s ethos by asking whether they recycle, provide reusable water bottles, hire local staff, and so on. Chances are a company will operate thoughtfully across the board, or not at all.
 
Don’t feel pressured by local guides to go to quote-unquote animal parks, advised Sano. “Often times they’re getting kickbacks, so go through more established tour operators and raise your antenna higher if you’re booking locally.”
Do seek out places that empower locals instead. “If traditional communities benefit, they are more likely to support anti-poaching efforts,” said Carr. So make sure that your operator employs or trains locals as guides and considers them for management positions; this demonstrates a commitment to social justice. And ask whether locals are allowed to enjoy the benefits of the area’s conservation—beyond the financial. “At Gorongosa Park we bring local students and teachers to the Park every day in small vans, so they can be ‘tourists’ and enjoy their national park. In fact, the No. 1 demographic group that visits Gorongosa is people from neighboring communities,” said Carr.
 
“The internet is a vast resource, and travelers should use it,” said the WWF’s Henry. It sounds like an obvious point, but it’s one worth making. “If anyone over the last five years had Googled the tiger temple in Thailand,” she elaborated, “they would have known that something was going on. There were countless articles, including ones from us, about concerns with that facility.” Don’t want to do the legwork? Task your travel agent with a little recon.
 
“Ask yourself this big question,” suggested Carr. “Will tourism lead to greater protection of this landscape by providing an economic value to the region maintained in its wild state? If so, you are part of the solution.”  

=== Title: Best Smartphone Camera Review: Google Pixel, iPhone 7 Plus, Moto Z - Bloomberg ===

Let me begin by saying this: I’m not a professional photographer. I have a slightly better-than-101 understanding of how cameras work and why things such as sensor size and f-stops matter. Looking at tech specs is far from my idea of an engaging read.
As a travel editor, I do love taking pictures, though. And I take tons of them—thousands and thousands on any given trip, almost entirely on smartphones. I take my 
 seriously and occasionally have images published here, on the very site you’re reading. For years, I’ve been so dependent on mobile photography that I’ve committed to carrying around 
 phones—one, an Android, that’s easier to type on, and the other, an iPhone, that has stronger apps and a killer camera.
For the last few weeks, I carried three: Google’s 
, the 
, and the 
, the latest entrants to the mobile photography race. (The Moto has flown largely under the radar, but its key selling point is its compatibility with magnetic "mods" that include a portable speaker and an attachable 
 camera.) We are living in the first true golden era of smartphone photography.
 
But that's not why you're here. You want to know which one is the best.
And, well, that answer is a bit complicated—after five head-to-head layman’s tests, where I focused on experience and results (hardware specs be damned), I'd be happy with any of them. 
This is not a cop-out as much it is a recognition that I’m probably a lot like you when it comes to my smartphone camera: All I want is for it to take good pictures, quickly, clearly, and without much effort. If I wanted a real camera, I'd get one of these 
. But with my phone, as long as I can compose a decent shot whenever there’s a great subject in view, and whatever the given situation is, I’d like to think my phone can meet me the rest of the way.
Here's how each performed against key selling points. All you have to do is determine your top priorities before your next upgrade. 
 
The idea of never missing a shot is what really drives mobile photography; it’s why every phone has shortcuts for opening the camera app. But that quick-draw image is no good unless it’s in focus. My auto-focus tests were conducted both in daylight and at dusk, with both fast-moving and still subjects.
The iPhone 7 Plus won for crispest images across the board. Even when I was snapping from the window of a moving car, it managed to deliver beautifully defined shots of the Manhattan skyline—one frame after the next.
The Pixel more or less flopped from the moving car window, but take out the fast-moving subject, and man, does that phone shine. In both daylight and low light, the auto-focus performed faster than those of its competitors, never taking more than a second to go from blur to fab.
The Moto Z fell in between. Two out of three frames on the Manhattan bridge came out clearly; everywhere else, I really appreciated the fact that the Hasselblad attachment lets you trigger its autofocus with a halfway press of the shutter button, just as on a real camera. It’s way easier than repeatedly touching the screen and makes one-handed shooting a breeze.
 
Luckily for the purposes of my experiment, I was able to head to 
, a spooky pumpkin festival in the Hudson Valley, ahead of the Halloween weekend, with all three phones in tow.
The Pixel—no contest. It did a commanding job of focusing quickly in low light and offering warm (but accurate) color balance. It had a stronger dynamic range, by far, which is what kept the red foliage in check in the background. You’ll also be thankful for these features in dimly lit restaurants.
While the MotoZ offered color that felt truer to life, the iPhone7 offered a sharper low-light image.
 
Usually, if I need a great zoom, I’m not relying on my smartphone. But that’s starting to change. Both the MotoZ (with its Hasselblad attachment) and the iPhone 7 Plus have a 10x zoom capability, whereas the Pixel is limited to 4x.
MotoZ, which I was able to use to get a crisp shot of the third-floor lettering on the side of an Upper East Side Synagogue from across the street. That’s because the attachable camera has a proper optical zoom lens that you won’t find on any other phone camera—not just a digital zoom that works by tightening the crop of your shot. The difference here was palpable.
The iPhone still has an exceptional zoom capacity—even if its 10x range is purely digital. But pushing it to the edge means you’re likely to get a blurry shot. That’s still better than the Pixel, whose zoom fell flat by comparison.
 
Pets and babies: They’re two of the most common subjects for smartphone photographers. So even if you’re not getting beautiful street style portraits, this is a feature that you’ll use on the regular.
The iPhone 7 Plus has a portrait mode that is designed to deliver flattering depth of field. (Read: Your background is softened while your subject is in clear view.) The result is really as beautiful as they make it sound. Getting there requires a little legwork, but thankfully, the phone will coach you through it: It tells you if you need more light or more distance from your subject. Sometimes you’re straight out of luck. But when it works, it really works wonders.
Even though the MotoZ has two dedicated portrait modes (one for night portraits and the other to correct backlighting), I struggled to capture my dog’s eyes or to get fully focused shots of her face. The Pixel, meanwhile, has no fancy portrait mode. But remember that excellent auto-correct? It helps deliver lovely portrait shots in a pinch.
 
Please forgive me: I took a bite of one cookie before I found my favorite composition. (It was delicious and fresh out of the oven.)
The MotoZ, maybe, by a hair. The three images are almost identical. That’s why I conducted a follow-up test, albeit a less visually interesting one: shooting the backside of a coin. I got the tightest shot with the MotoZ, with the iPhone coming in as a close second place. The Pixel struggled. Good thing nobody needs photos of a penny, anyway.

=== Title: New-Vintage Legacy Jeep Scrambler: Review Video - Bloomberg ===

Regardless of your politics, I think we can all agree that Ronald Reagan knew how to strike a pose.
See him astride some gleaming Chestnut on his ranch or inside that old blue Jeep from '83, and you can practically hear the wistful hum of 
It’s the Jeep I’m especially enamored with today. I drove a $150,000 modern replica of one the other week across orange groves near Ojai, Calif.
Maybe you’ve heard of the brand, 
. It’s a Jackson Hole, Wyo., company founded six years ago by Winslow Bent, a truck fanatic who has built this kind of thing his whole life and who now employs a couple of other mechanics to produce two dozen vehicles a year in vintage bodies but with all new components. (It’s the same idea as that 
 I drove last summer—an automaker that revives classic brands and vintage aesthetics with modern components and luxuries.)
Legacy's Power Wagon trucks are its most famous—they are modeled on the old WC Weapons Carrier trucks the American military used during World War II—but the unique Jeeps, such as the Scrambler I drove, are the cooler option. He makes them for people who can afford to pay $120,000 to $200,000 on a vehicle with the style and drive sensibility of a vintage work truck but that doesn’t come with maintenance and reliability issues—and there were plenty of them on those old Jeeps. (Yes, it’s about the same as what you’d pay for a high-end Land Rover or G-Wagon, although for an entirely different 
).
Scramblers, also known as Jeep CJ-8s, made their debut in 1981 as the long-wheelbase versions of Jeep’s CJ-7; they had front-locking hubs that would engage four-wheel drive, manual or automatic transmission, and tape graphs and special wheels that came as part of a special appearance package Jeep offered. They were the descendants of the original 
, introduced to consumers in 1945 as a civilian model of the ubiquitous U.S military workhorses. Jeep eventually discontinued them when it introduced the more modern Wrangler in 1986.
Bent makes each Scrambler by hand over 600 hours of work; he scours the globe finding old bodies to restore in pure aluminum and waterproofing
 then pairs them with new parts and cosmetic upgrades. The Scrambler I drove had a 240-horsepower 630T 3.0L turbodiesel engine sourced from a Boeing Phantom Badger model and tuned by Banks Power shop, then paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and American-made 37-inch Toyo Open Country RT tires.
What’s crazy about that setup is that it gives you dozens of drive-mode options when combined with the fact that you can adjust the four-wheel drive into front- or rear-wheel drive and into high, neutral, or low gears as well.
That made climbing hills and over boulders on Bent’s avocado ranch almost as easy as riding in a driverless car, since you don’t need to touch the wheel, the gas, or the brakes: I just popped the levers on the floorboards by my right ankle into the down position and let the Jeep do its thing. The Scrambler gets 420 pound-feet of torque right from the lowest gears, so it’s proficient at dirt, sand, snow, and, uh, rocks. At 3,200 pounds, it’s exceptionally light (the 
weighs nearly twice that), which allows for more than 30 mpg fuel efficiency, though it’s not suited to heavy towing of more than 5,000 pounds. Bent offers low-emission CARB-certified gasoline, efficient Tier II turbo-diesel, and bio-diesel engines as options for the Jeeps he builds. 
Most people who buy them use them as estate trucks or for hunting and fishing. They’re not incredibly useful on the highway—you can cruise at 80 mph, sure, but with their tall open tops and deafening engine rumble, you’ll be windblown and browbeaten by the time you arrive.
I drove mine both on road and off. We spent half the day filming the rig on rocks and dirt and the other half canvassing sunny little two-lane roads behind Ojai.
To get inside I had to pull myself up and in behind the steering wheel, grabbing a handhold high on the roll bar and hopping like you do to stirrup-up on a tall horse—and I'm nearly six feet tall. If you’re short, you’ll want a little step to help you get inside the three-foot-plus clearance.
The Jeep itself is incredibly fun to drive. It rumbles like a tank and towers over everything else on the road, with massive brakes and a steering wheel that goes all over the place as you turn it. This has the most give of anything I’ve ever driven, including 
. That's a good thing for the type of all-terrain driving you’ll be doing in this.
At the helm you feel like 
 navigating a desert minefield in 
. Its feeling of power is infectious—you might get a bit drunk on it, grinning like the Cheshire Cat as you drive. Just go with it. 
Bent has done his patriotic best to make the design of the beast match the energy underneath the Scrambler's hood. The flat windshield is removable, the big knobby tires can be engaged depending on the terrain, the dashboard has old-style Jeep dials, a glove-box like a tin can, a radio, and a heater, and not much else. The radio, control knobs, leather seats, and gear-shifters are all weatherproof; the rest of the truck is as bare as a sardine can, which is exactly what you want from a vehicle like this.
The standard version of the Scrambler comes with a cloth soft-top that you can tack on when you want it. It also has myriad seat options behind the two pilots’ chairs up front: two rows of seats one after the other, bench seat rows facing each other, or rear space open like a pickup truck, to name a few. Or just put in one of those high-chair setups you use to scout game.
Other options include a $3,000 premium sound system, those $2,500 air locking differentials I mentioned earlier, $350 LED headlamps, and a $3,000 air conditioning system if the open-top isn’t breezy enough for you. Legacy Power Wagons often shrink wraps and ships, uses enclosed transport containers, or personally delivers the newly made Jeeps to customers. 
But the beautiful thing about these Jeeps is that, since they’re hand built and made-to-order anyway, you can pretty much have it any way you want it. And on this big toy, it pays to have a little fun. Usually I’m not one for those '70s-style orange stripes and big SCRAMBLER lettering across anything, but here, it just works.
There is one major caveat: The Scramblers take about a year to build, and the waiting list is one year long. Although, to my mind that’s a small price to pay for this kind of freedom.

Ah, summertime, the wonderful, warm season celebrated with cold drinks in coconuts, fabulous beach trips, and easy living ... unless of course you're one of those Americans who has to work for a living.
Unable to escape the confines of the office, the rest are left daydreaming about summer vacation, with one survey putting the price tag on that fantasy at $43,154, about the average annual U.S. income.

=== Title: How the Humble Taco Inspired a $750 Mexican Meal - Bloomberg ===

Rene Redzepi, the foraging Danish chef behind Noma, traveled across Mexico to plan for his forthcoming pop-up restaurant on the Yucatán Peninsula. He tasted an array of fresh fish, platanos, and even some delicious insects.
But the most important ingredient Redzepi knew he had to incorporate?
The taco — or at least the corn-based masa dough behind some of the country's best-loved staples.
"It is simply the most influential piece of food in central America," Redzepi said. "We will give it our best shot."
 will open up on Tuesday at 10 a.m. East Coast time, and if the restaurant's previous trips abroad are any guide, slots for the seven-week "residency" will sell out fast. When Noma opened in Tokyo in 2015, there was a waiting list of 60,000 people for the five-week run. In Sydney last year, there were outstanding requests for 27,000 tables during a 10-week residency. Both sold out in minutes.
Don't expect the menu to look like anything you've ever seen at a Mexican restaurant. Especially not for $600 per person, which includes food and drinks. The bill climbs to $750 if you include 16% local tax and 9% tip.
For one thing, insects will be on the menu. When Redzepi served 
 during a pop-up in London in 2012, diners were shocked. He's not expecting such a reaction in Mexico, where grasshoppers, ant eggs, and wasp larvae are among the delicacies he has sampled.
"No one blinks here if you eat an ant," he said. "It's like ordering a flat white."
Another staple — platanos — will be on the menu, but in an unusual fashion.
"One dish we have tested and are going to put on the menu will sound incredibly weird, but it is delicious," Redzepi said. "It's a ceviche of a large clam, sliced very thin and mixed with thinly sliced banana."
Redzepi said the dish goes against everything he learned growing up in Denmark and serving as an apprentice in a French restaurant, where he was told that sweet fruit and fish didn't go together. "It would be scoffed at," he said. "But some bananas here have the acidity of an apple. We are using one called platano manzano
which is incredible."
There will be plenty of seafood. Redzepi said he found "incredible" urchins, clams, crabs, tuna, and shrimp. "The fish they shoot with spears, it is so fresh," he said.
The restaurant is in the jungle, so most of the cooking will be done over fire. No large stoves.
Dinner will be served at Noma Mexico five nights a week, with about 120 guests each service. The project is a collaboration between Redzepi and his former sous chef at Noma, Rosio Sanchez and her Copenhagen taqueria Hija de Sanchez. The restaurant will be located adjacent to La Zebra Hotel, at Carretera Tulum-Boca Paila. Noma is working with American Express and Colibri Boutique Hotels on the residency. 
In the meantime, Noma in Copenhagen will temporarily close at the end of February as it moves from its waterside location to a site nearby where it will open late in 2017 as part of an urban farm.
Redzepi said he plans more residencies in future, as they have become important professionally and personally to him and his chefs. (He is taking about 65 staffers to Mexico.)
"When I was young, my friends would travel, doing drugs and having sex and learning about the world," he said. "But I was stuck in the kitchen."

=== Title: The Best Restaurants in Lima Are Putting Culture on the Plate - Bloomberg ===

Culinary insiders have been heralding Peruvian food as the “next big thing” since local hero chef 
 cemented his presence on the World’s Best Restaurants list in 2011. But for half a decade, Peruvian food has been the perpetual bridesmaid of the food world: repeatedly admired and repeatedly cast aside.
That’s finally changing. For the first time, data show that a global crowd is catching on to what the industry has been buzzing about for years. In 2015, Lima’s international airport welcomed a whopping 4.22 million international visitors, more than any other Latin American hub and double the figure of its closest competitor, Mexico City, according to MasterCard’s latest 
 (PDF). That number represented a 7 percent year-on-year rise and put it on the list of the top 10 fastest-growing tourism destinations worldwide since 2009.
Think all those newcomers were on their way to Machu Picchu? 
 by the UN World Tourism Organization claims that at least 42 percent of them were coming, first and foremost, to eat. Tally up their impact and you get a food industry that's set to generate more than 25 billion soles (about $7.5 billion) in 2016, according to Peru’s gastronomy association, Apega.
So what’s all the fuss about? More than grilled chicken sandwiches and ceviche, for sure. Lima has one of the most productive fisheries in the world, a rich heritage of Amazonian and Andean culinary tradition, and an affinity for bold spices, thanks to its sizable Chinese, African, and Japanese populations. They’re all manifest in these four food trends that are taking the city—and the world—by storm.
 
At the 
 in New York in June, a small Lima spot named 
 skyrocketed from its debut position, No. 44, to No. 13. Now its Lima-born chef, Mitsuharu Tsumura, is becoming the torchbearer for the cuisine that put Maido in the spotlight: a bold fusion of Japanese and Peruvian flavors called Nikkei cuisine.
Nikkei cuisine isn’t new, exactly. It dates to a wave of Japanese immigration in the 19th century and has been part of the vocabulary at sushi spots such as Nobu for decades. But the current trend goes well beyond sushi. A recent dinner at Maido, for instance, included gyoza filled with guinea pig and soba soup made with heirloom Sachapapa potatoes.
At 
, newly opened in the San Isidro business district, the Nikkei-style menu gets a molecular twist. 
 (octopus in olive sauce), for instance, comes with dehydrated olive “chips” and a smoked Japanese whiskey cocktail.
Proof that Nikkei is bubbling up: It’s the focus of a new restaurant in Barcelona called 
, spearheaded by none other than El Bulli’s Albert Adriá.
 
Ten years ago, Limeños would have been stumped if you had asked them to describe Amazonian cuisine. That’s changed, thanks to one man: Pedro Miguel Schiaffino. Known locally as the “jungle chef,” Schiaffino unearths the flavors of the Peruvian Amazon at his restaurant, 
; the theme extends to the décor, with jade green accent walls and tribal-looking serve ware. They come to the table piled with such unfamiliar recipes as
an Incan tamal of sorts that’s made here with cassava, duck, eggs, and cumin; just like in the Amazon, it arrives wrapped in herbaceous 
 leaves.
When Schiaffino started, he had to forge connections to track down his ingredients; in the wake of his success, Amazonian purveyors have a burgeoning business on their hands. Now you can find ingredients such as 
 (a giant freshwater fish) and 
 (river snails the size of baseballs) on dozens of menus across the capital. But for the best taste of the trend, Amaz still reigns supreme.
 
Until recently, Criollo cuisine was reserved for home cooks of modest means. But comfort food is experiencing new levels of global popularity, and in Lima, that translates to a rise in buzzy Criollo-themed restaurants. At 
, artsy locals from the Barranco district sit at blonde wood high-tops and order dishes their grandmothers would have made from a hand-written menu. The staples to try: 
 (a tripe and potato stew) and 
 (a patty of rice, beans, meats, and yellow chili).
Want to see just how fancy Criollo cooking can go? Head to the upscale standard-bearer 
 in nearby Miraflores, where the 
 comes deconstructed, with wood-smoked duck and pickled avocado.
 
As the dish that singlehandedly put this nation on the global food map, ceviche has become a ubiquitous symbol of Peruvian pride. Has the trend run its course? You be the judge. Just don’t leave Lima without a taste of its signature dish.
Some of the best ceviches come from humble street stalls such as 
 in Surquillo and 
 in Miraflores, where a plate piled high with seafood can cost as little as 10 soles ($3). You’ll find the trendiest institutions, such as Gaston Acurio’s 
 and Rafael Osterling’s 
 along Lima's ceviche row (on and around Avenida La Mar, in Miraflores). Whatever you do, be sure to stop at the latter for the ceviche galactico. It’s this writer’s personal favorite—served in a sleek, indoor-outdoor dining room with an unconventional blend of flounder, crabmeat, and sea urchin.

=== Title: Lamborghini Huracan LP 610-4 Spyder Review: Video - Bloomberg ===

Often the greatest feats of engineering are the ones that seem easy, even imperceptible.
As when you take a high-performing sports car, remove the top, and find a way to achieve the same aggression, stiffness, and wind efficiency in the new version. It’s a lot more complicated than just lopping off the roof. Physics and aerodynamics are complicated devils.
The engineers at Lamborghini have found a way to tame them, though, with the 2016 Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 Spyder. This is the drop-top version of the excellent 
 we saw last year; rather than making the car heavy or burdensome around corners, a common problem of convertibles, the alteration comes only as an improvement. The starting MSRP is $262,350; delivery and fees bring the number to $267,545, roughly on-par with competitors from Ferrari and Aston Martin and a bump more than the $238,500 coupe version.
When driving the beast, the open-air thrills run large. Lambo credits this to “redesigning every single element for the precise purpose of eliminating the roof.” It sounds like quite a process. Maybe even magic. I’m glad it paid off.
I drove the Huracán Spyder in Los Angeles traffic, through West Hollywood and Santa Monica, in the Malibu hills, and along the twisty Pacific Coast Highway. It is the most intense modern production car I’ve ever driven, equaled only by its siblings (Aventadors and Gallardos) and by a few halcyon afternoons spent piloting a Bugatti or two. That’s rare air.
I mean intense in the true sense of the word: From the moment you get behind the wheel—no, from the moment you see the car—your senses go into overdrive. Everything is heightened, super-sharp in focus, as when you walk alone through a dark alley. One errant sound, one blush of wind on your cheek, and you whip to action like an assassin ready to fight.
If you were, and you did, the Huracán Spyder would prove an apt weapon. Heck, it even looks like a weapon, a fighter jet whose edges along a taut body might as well have been carved by the wind itself. The Spyder has a short nose, dipped forward and down, set with deeply slanted headlamps that hold triangular LED lights. Turn the lights on and the car becomes an animal growling at you from the shadows.
The blackened front grill enhances the predator effect. Four big wheels, on 20-inch blade-style rims, are pushed all the way out to the corners of the car; a transparent engine bonnet is optional—and preferred, in order to better show off the car. It sits behind the front seats as a clear divider between the inside of the car and the rear trunk.
If you want, you can choose among a handful of colors on your ceramic brake calipers (red looks nice) and a smattering of carbon fiber accents to augment the hybrid aluminum/carbon frame. The outer skin of the Huracán consists of lightweight aluminum and composite, too. Most convertibles typically weigh more than their coupe counterparts, but at just under 3,400 pounds vs. a 200-pound-lighter coupe, this one stays on the lighter side.
The real potency of this fighter comes from what’s under the hood.
The Huracán Spyder has the same V10 602-horsepower engine as the hardtop version, with the same all-wheel drive on a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. You can choose among three drive modes, plus launch control; use the paddle shifters, if you don’t like automatic, in changing gears. Sadly, there is no manual option.
Top speed here is 201 miles per hour—exactly the same as with the coupe—with a 0-62 mph sprint time of 3.4 seconds. (The coupe does it in 3.2 seconds.) Lamborghini is particularly proud of these statistics, along with the fact that both cars share virtually the same drag coefficient for wind resistance. It’s quite the engineering feat.
I drove it a lot when I was in California. And I have no complaints. None.
Sure, driving over potholes is a drag. Slowing down sufficiently to handle them without damaging the rims, bumper, or chassis tested my patience to the extreme, and the lift-kit that raises the car nearly two inches only goes so far. Tiptoeing over Pacific Palisades’ many speed bumps gave me a cold sweat. I can’t imagine trying to navigate the New York parking garage cartel at all. I’d develop an ulcer from the stress.
But once you get out to the road, once you make that final corner and see a stretch of highway open before you, you’re golden. The car is perfect. The steering might as well be linked directly to your brain in its precision. Braking is instantaneous. There's no rolling around corners, no lumbering up hills trying to gather speed, no hesitation when you press the gas. You could put this car through the most grueling 
 possible and never get the sense that it was ever really straining.
Then you come back to earth. You know how you’re actually safest flying fast and high in a jet rather than during takeoff and landing? Driving slow and idling in traffic is comparable for the Huracán Spyder. I've already mentioned the excruciatingly low clearance. There’s also the lack of visibility (I pretty much gave up even attempting to look behind me—not a good thing) and a dearth of head space. (I’m 2 inches shy of 6 feet.) The tiny, grainy, rear-view camera doesn’t proffer much consolation.
Looking forward wasn’t good either: The bar across the top of the windshield aligned perfectly with my line of vision, prohibiting me from seeing any light-changes whatsoever at intersections. This is my pet peeve with convertibles and boy, did it flare. I had to crouch and hunch my back in order to see stoplights. It kind of ruins your street cred. With the top up, my head nearly touched the ceiling.
There is a cup holder, if you buy one. (It costs an additional $600 as part of a travel package.) There is relatively little seat adjustment and no USB plug. If you want cruise control, it costs an additional $1,000. I don’t have to tell you I deactivated the start/stop function as soon as I could. That, plus the automatic cylinder deactivation, will get you 17 miles per gallon in the city, which is a better rating than I expected. I mean, this is a Lamborghini. At a certain point with this caliber of car, it doesn’t pay to care.  
I love the dashboard, though. It looks like a pilot’s cockpit, complete with the essential toggle switches (windows, climate) separated by metal bars and devoid of other knob nonsense. The steering wheel is flattened at the bottom and fits ergonomically in the hand. And everyone loves the fact that the start button for the car hides under a red cage that you must flip up in order to access. It takes a split-second longer than normal to use the thing, but the novelty goes far.
There’s no extra interior space—not even a ledge. And while it can get loud with the top down, the car is silent with the top engaged—it takes only 18 seconds to raise, at speeds up to 31mph. Loud rag-top flapping is as far from the Huracán as launch control is to a Model T. Choose the fabric in red, brown, or black.
I should note that Lamborghini has offered some interesting accessories for your journey: A rim kit, a rechargeable flashlight, and a matching briefcase and luggage set will serve you well. The briefcase might just fit in the tiny trunk, though nothing else will. (Prices for those vary according to the dealer.)
There’s also an extensive customization program, of which Lambo tells me nearly all of new owners avail themselves. It stands to reason. This car demonstrates the best of Italian engineering, technology, performance, and style. It will become 
, given 30 years or so. If you are lucky enough to own one, you might as well make it yours.

=== Title: Tips for Avoiding Winter Weather Delays and Canceled Flights - Bloomberg ===

Winter came early this year, with storms already pounding much of the U.S. If your holiday travel plans are in doubt because of them, there are still steps you can take to make sure you get where you need to go and get there on time. Here’s what you need to keep in mind, whether you’ve already booked your trip or are worried about future travels.
Even the best-laid plans can go awry in the face of inclement weather. Here are five coping strategies you can put to use if Mother Nature conspires against you.
 Nobody wants to wait on hold for hours just to talk to a surly, overworked airline agent on her 100th call of the day. So if you’re not a top-tier elite frequent flier with your own dedicated customer-service line, try one of the airline’s international service numbers instead. (You’ll find them on an airline’s international contact webpage.) Crises tend to be limited regionally or nationally, so calling another country is a reliable shortcut to an agent. Just use an app such as Skype to sidestep the calling fees and prioritize English-speaking countries such as the U.K., Australia, and Singapore.
 No, we’re not talking about oversold flights. Airlines often like to become proactive when inclement weather looms and will offer weather waivers for passengers that are most at risk for delays or cancellations. If you see one announced on your airline’s website, jump at the opportunity. It’s a fee-free way to change your travel plans—or cancel them altogether and get a refund.
Club agents in 
 are empowered to help customers with flight plans and changes and can often go above and beyond the average customer-service rep. So if you’re already at the airport, get yourself into the lounge—even if that means paying for a day pass. Don’t expect miracles; do expect some support, plus a civilized environment with free drinks.
 According to a recent study by social-media software tracking firm 
, U.S. airlines respond to about half the tweets they’re tagged in—sometimes within minutes. Whether they can solve your problems is another matter, so squeeze this in while you’re pursuing other methods. It might just be the fastest way to get someone’s attention.
Asking an airline to compensate you for a delay might as well be the dictionary definition of futility. But travelers tend to forget that many credit cards, and especially 
, usually offer robust flight delay and cancellation protections when you use them to pay for a ticket. 
For example, the 
 offers trip cancellation coverage of up to $10,000 if your plans are cancelled due to severe weather (or a variety of other circumstances). Its trip-delay reimbursement is good for up to $500 per ticket if your flight is postponed for longer than 12 hours or requires an overnight stay.
Every card is different, but the point is: It’s worth checking what you’re already paying for. You might be way ahead of the game without even knowing it.
 
Follow these strategies if you’re still shopping for winter airfares. 
Flight delays tend to stack up as the day goes on, so plan to depart before 10:00 a.m. to maximize your odds of an on-time arrival. That’s the obvious tip. Here’s how you take it to the next level: Look up your specific flight’s on-time record 
. If your flight is delayed more than 30 percent of the time, think long and hard about your other options.
 Every connection is another chance at a delay or missed flight. Paying the premium for a direct flight is like buying peace of mind.
 In addition to on-time arrivals for airlines, the Department of Transportation maintains delay-related data for every major airport in the U.S. If your origin or destination is served by more than one airport, look up your options 
 and choose the one with the better track record. Get bonus points by checking how long the average delay is and how many flights get cancelled annually at each hub.
If you’re flying short-haul, angle for airports that are within easy access of a train or bus terminal. That way, if delays strike, you can arrange alternate transportation to your final destination. 
 Prioritize the airline with the most extensive route network in a specific region—it will give you more rebooking options if something goes wrong. How to tell which carrier to pick? Do a quick search on Expedia or Kayak and see which company has the broadest range of available flights. The carrier with the lone, affordable route? That’s not your best bet.
 Changing your ticket is an easy way to get ahead of a winter storm, but it can come with a big price tag. Here are two ways to avoid those fees—without buying expensive refundable tickets: One is via your loyalty program: 
could help waive same-day change and standby fees. If that’s not in the cards, try booking with Southwest Airlines, which doesn’t charge for changes that are made at least 10 minutes prior to your flight.
 Apps such as FlightAware offer real-time data on delays and cancellations. They’ll guarantee that you’re among the first to know when trouble is about to hit—so that you can beat the masses to the customer support lines.
 

=== Title: La Paz, Bolivia Travel Guide: Where to Eat, Sleep, Drink, Sightsee - Bloomberg ===

Even in the context of a huge and under-appreciated continent, La Paz, Bolivia’s high-altitude administrative capital, is something of an obscurity. Most travelers barely pass through for a stopover en route to the jewel-like mineral lakes, fuming volcanoes, and the lunar salt flats at Uyuni. All that is about to change.
Ignore what you’ve heard about the city’s lack of obvious attractions. Forget about the protests that used to regularly shut down the colonial center. And cast away all your doubts about the food: notoriously bland mountains of meat and potatoes, washed down with tepid coke or a passable lager called Paceña.
Thanks to an unprecedented period of political stability and peace (courtesy of the country’s first indigenous president, Evo Morales), improved infrastructure, and a bonafide 
 spearheaded by the co-founder of Copenhagen’s Noma, La Paz is ready for its moment in the spotlight.
Go now, and you’ll find a city with an incredible setting more than 12,000 feet above sea level, with a captivating amalgam of architectural styles and 
, from vibrant markets to remote neighborhoods perched atop stalagmite formations. It is, at this particular moment, a dazzling, dizzying antidote to the domesticated sameness of international style. Here’s our guide to the city’s best.
La Paz hotels used to be either no frills guest houses or big American chains, but that all changed with the opening of the 
 in the swanky southern neighborhood of Calacoto, which is also the heart of the city’s burgeoning food scene. The city’s first boutique hotel, the Atix was built and decorated using indigenous materials, an extension of the modern-local aesthetic that is the core of the new La Paz.
Up in the historic center, a neighborhood historically associated with backpackers and bureaucrats, a second boutique hotel is slated to open in the coming months. 
 will offer the first (for the time being, the only) stylish digs in colonial La Paz, just off the quiet Plaza Murillo.  
Much of the excitement in La Paz’s new food scene emanates from the affluent Zona Sur, where 
opened 
, his first restaurant outside Scandinavia, four years ago to near-universal acclaim. Like the New Nordic cuisine he helped spearhead in Copenhagen, the food at Gustu aims to raise awareness of, and increase local pride in, Bolivia’s products. Executive chef Kamilla Seidler has studded her menu with dishes such as açai-stained amaranth in a creamy Brazil nut soup, wisps of smoked Amazonian catfish layered with beetroot and sprouts, and an exquisite mid-meal cocktail of house-infused banana-coconut singani (a local brandy) spiked with banana vinegar. T
Nearby, the kitchen at 
Atix Hotel aims to conjure the sensory experience of the Bolivian landscape with such dishes as smoked trout cream with Andean seaweed and indigenous potatoes. The result is a perfect distillation of Lake Titicaca, the world’s highest navigable lake.
 takes a humbler approach, serving a concise menu of typical dishes from Bolivia’s subtropical lowlands. The simple café takes its name from a typical croquette made of yucca flour and cheese, which arrives at the table warm and pleasantly chewy. Order it with masaco, salty rounds of mashed plantains and dried, shredded beef, and mocochinchi, Bolivia’s national drink, made with dehydrated peaches.
Bolivia’s all-local "Kilometro 0" movement—a loosely knit consortium of "slow food" chefs, distillers, and bartistas inspired by their untapped national bounty—owes its origins to Gustu, but one of its most prominent outposts today is 
, the only fine-dining restaurant in the historic center. There, a creative set menu veers away from the meat-heavy inclinations of traditional Bolivian cookery to focus on the fruits, vegetables, and herbs that have historically played a supporting role in local kitchens.
Casually romantic dining room at 
flips the Kilometro 0 concept on its head, using exclusively Bolivian ingredients to prepare pitch-perfect Italian food. The 24-year-old chef, Gabriela Prudencio Claros, an alum of both Gustu and Mario Batali's Lipa in New York, turns out a decadent oxtail and pappardelle ragu—perfect end-of-trip indulgences.
Because of their commitment to the homegrown, Kilometro 0 restaurants such as Propiedad Pública and Gustu can serve excellent cocktails, thanks only to the rise of local distillers preparing artisanal liquors within the city. Not surprisingly, these distillers can be worth a visit on their own.
On the outskirts of El Alto, the immense satellite city that sprawls over the high plains adjacent to central La Paz, 
 produces some of the finest vodka in the Western Hemisphere, using Andean glacier water and local wheat. Daniel Lonsdale produces his Amazonica and Andina gins under the label 
, layering such regional botanicals as cacao and a mountain herb called k’hoa (somewhere between mint and eucalyptus) over more traditional aromatics. In October, a pair of recent college graduates launched 
, Bolivia’s first whiskey still, with a product called Killa Moonshine, made from Andean maize. Operating out of a tiny distillery in the heart of the colonial city, the team hopes to gradually start experimenting with barrel aging and entirely new tipples made from indigenous grains such as amaranth and quinoa.
If you don't make the tasting rooms, find these spirits on menus from the quirky bars of the Sopocachi district—places like 
 and the tranquil 
elegant Zona Sur tapas bar, 
, and the cocktail-centric gastropub, 
.
Coffee’s also entered a new artisanal moment. As happened 
, where international demand consumes virtually all of the country’s high-quality beans, it can be virtually impossible to find good Bolivian coffee in Bolivia. Norma Chavez and Fabio Arandia are helping to change that at 
, their newly opened coffee shop serving the city’s best brew in what are undoubtedly its prettiest surroundings. Set in a quaint, one-story house filled with antiques scavenged from the homes of aging relatives, Typica’s bright, chintzy charm would seem right at home in East L.A. were it not for its total lack of affectation. Order one of the local brews made with a Chemex, Chavez and Arandia’s preferred brewing method, to savor the distinct citric acidity of the highest-grown beans on earth.
Though La Paz’s new culinary reputation is being made in the Zona Sur, the historic center is still where you’ll find the bulk of the city’s most fascinating sites.
Lacking the rich architectural heritage of Lima or Buenos Aires, La Paz’s beauty lies in its chaotic, contrasting textures. The best way to explore the city—after a day spent adjusting to the altitude—is on foot. Begin with the 18th century 
 then continue uphill past the tourist shops selling alpaca sweaters on Sagarnaga and turn right onto Calle Linares to enter the 
, the closest things to must-see sights in town.
Next to the Basilica, the immense 
 is also the best place to try more traditional Bolivian cooking. Head to the top floor to find Doña Elvira and her addictive chorizo sandwiches. She’s been making them for 30 years, using a family recipe that combines pork, beef, and llama meat. She greets many of the hundreds of people that stream through daily, either with hugs or admonishments for staying away too long. (Doña Elvira is one of several street food vendors that make up a new circuit of 
, or stalls, in the city center area that are coming on board with the Kilometro 0 program, with support from the team at Gustu.) 
Once you’ve finished your chorizo, head to the far end of the same aisle to try Doña Elvira’s sister’s homemade buñuelos (deep-fried, cheese-stuffed pastries powdered with confectioner’s sugar), torn open and dipped into cups of thick purple api, a drink made from sweetened ground corn.
If you’re in La Paz on a Thursday or a Sunday, hop aboard the recently constructed 
, a growing system of gondolas that are the city’s high-flying answer to a metro, connecting La Paz proper to El Alto. The Teleférico's Red Line will drop you at the edge of the city’s immense 
, where countless stalls sell everything from second-hand clothes to hand-woven woolens, medicinal herbs, and fresh honey spooned straight out of mobile hives wheeled around in glass cases.
Start your morning with a steaming bowl of fish soup or pork chops and potatoes roasted in a wood-fired oven, then get lost in the market for as many hours as you like. (There’s virtually no end to it.) If you’ve come on a Thursday, make your way to the Villa Esperanza branch of 
. (Open only for weekday lunch, and you’ll probably need a cab). There, for just $2, you can get a traditional Bolivian “set” lunch—consisting of dishes such as quinoa soup and a baked bean casserole—prepared and served by students at a culinary school for at-risk youth, founded by Claus Meyer in 2014.
Though Gustu and Meyer have received their share of criticism (some local cooks are understandably irked by the presumption of a European chef touching down to "rescue" the local cuisine), Manq’a and the Kilometro 0 restaurants have undoubtedly changed the way people in vastly different parts of this fascinating city think about what and how they eat.
El Alto has grown exponentially in the last 40 years, from a town of a few thousand people to a city of more than 1 million. Such growth comes with its growing pains. Hire a taxi to drive you from Manq’a to the terminal of the Yellow Teleférico line on the other side of the city, and you’ll likely encounter maddening traffic along dusty roads crowded with vendors selling sheep skins or used clothing or PVC piping—evidence of the thriving, informal economy that keeps El Alto alive. But you’ll also see signs of growing wealth reflected in the 
: Technicolor façades lined up along busy roads like so many exclamation points, as madly geometric as pinball machines. This is the face of a new La Paz, a city proud of its indigenous heritage, connected to its soil, and still determinedly odd in the way it expresses that heritage to the world and to itself.
Drifting back down into La Paz proper on the Teleférico, the land will drop out below you as the ramshackle brick houses of El Alto cascade over the cliffs toward the stream of high-rises that has risen where a river once flowed. If you’re lucky, the triple peak of Mount Illamani will make an appearance on the horizon. Below you, small domestic scenes will play out in the courtyards and on the rooftops of the homes just below your feet. From this vantage point you’ll see clearly the staggering alien beauty of this city—and you’ll wonder why no one told you about it.

=== Title: Pebble Beach Vintage Car Auctions Indicate More Collectors Under 40 - Bloomberg ===

The auction results are in at Pebble Beach, and Ferrari 
 rules. 
Of the top 10 high-selling cars sold in the days surrounding the annual 
, seven were Ferraris. 
The top-seller was a 1964 Ferrari 250 LM Coupe that sold for $17,600,000 at the RM Sotheby's auction. Rounding out the top three sellers this weekend were a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California SWB Spyder that fetched $16,830,000 and a 1962 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Coupe that brought in $16,500,000, both at Gooding & Co. auctions. This was not unexpected—the marque is on a decade of domination in the vintage market. But the environment is undergoing some subtle changes in size and demographic, say experts.
All told, auction houses lead by Gooding, RM Sotheby’s, Bonhams, and Mecum Auction took in $390.6 million dollars, according to early estimates by Hagerty, a Traverse City (Mich.) insurer and classic car database. That’s down from last year’s cumulative total of $428.1 million, though by the end of the week the final number for 2015 will be closer to $410 million as final results trickle in.
“The market continues to show strength, but growth is coming at a slower rate compared to the dramatic increases witnessed for the past several years,” says McKeel Hagerty, chief executive officer of Hagerty. “Bidding generally seemed rational, and the dip in prices is a function of slowing momentum and the absence of last year's Ferrari GTO. Prices for special cars are increasing, but elsewhere prices are consistent with what we witnessed during the January auctions.”
Among other best-sellers, McLaren, Jaguar, and Porsche took top billing. At RM Sotheby’s, a 1998 McLaren F1 LM Specification sold for $13.75 million and a 1953 Jaguar C-Type Works Lightweight Roadster sold for $13.2 million. At Gooding, a 1982 Porsche 956 Coupe sold for $10.1 million.
Hagerty says recent spikes in the Porsche market drove younger (read: under 40) buyers to the Monterey auctions this year and could indicate an emerging market. In fact, while such blue-chips as Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Mercedes-Benz continue strong, so-called Gen X cars are doing quite well. Bonhams sold a 1989 BMW E30 M3 for $96,250, and Sotheby's sold a carbureted 1978 Ferrari 512 BB for $467,500. Even Toyota Supras from the early 1980s are returning strong margins, though they still sell for far less than six figures.
“Prices for emerging segments like 1980-90s cars are increasing,” Hagerty says.
Other notable cars sold included a 2005 Ferrari Enzo that had been built as a gift for Pope John Paul II and that fetched $6.050 million; a Steve McQueen-owned 1976 Porsche 930 Turbo Carrera that sold for $1.95 million; and a private collection of 25 Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and Bugattis that fetched a one-sale record of $75.4 million. 
 

=== Title: The Five Best New Cameras for Travelers - Bloomberg ===

For travelers who are serious about their photos, smartphone snaps just don’t cut it—no matter how good the latest iPhone camera may be.
It’s almost always worth lugging around a proper camera if you’re heading out on a trip-of-a-lifetime, whether it’s on safari or to Machu Picchu. We recently 
; below, you’ll find five more new releases that’ll elevate your vacation photos, whether you’re a total novice or a professional shutterbug.
The reasons for bringing along a dedicated pocket camera are few and far between these days—unless, of course, it’s rugged and waterproof, like the compact 
 ($200). How else are you going to get those one-of-a-kind underwater shots while snorkeling in the Andaman Islands? You’ll also feel comfortable using it on boats, pool decks, and in other splash-prone places. The list of benefits goes on: It’s stylish and lightweight, and although it’s affordable, it’s also practically indestructible. It’ll survive drops of up to 5.8 feet and can plunge to depths of 50 feet.
 
If you want a camera that’ll fit unobtrusively in your pocket (or clutch), but want more power and capability than any smartphone provides, go for the 
 by Panasonic ($700). It has an F1.4-2.8 24-72mm Leica lens, a 1.4 aperture that’s great for low-light shots, and a 1-inch sensor that’s almost twice as big as the iPhone 7’s. It’s that sensor that makes the biggest difference: It lets in and processes enough light to deliver clean, clear, and natural-looking images from candlelit dinners and strobe-lit dance floors alike.
Pro tip: When you’re shooting 4K video footage, use the Post Focus feature to extract still images from your flick, retroactively change the focus of a shot, or merge similar images together to create the perfect frame.
 
This slim, mirrorless update of a classic 1960s camera features retro design touches—metal dials and controls, leather grain, a separate viewfinder—that belie the digital smarts within. Among them are an ultrafast autofocus, 5-axis image stabilization, and a fully swiveling touchscreen, all meant to help you nail those easy-to-miss shots. (Whether that means lions on the prowl in Botswana or celeb sightings in Hollywood is up to you.)
The 
 ($1,200) is Instagram-ready, too: Add effects on the fly with dedicated dials on the front and back, which let you play with color saturation or choose from preset filters, and upload with the help of built-in Wi-Fi.
 
Pictures taken with instant cameras aren’t known for their realistic color, but their faded, grainy look and real-time tangibility go hand in hand with today’s lust for all things analog. And if you’re going instant, you can now skip the Polaroid and go with a Leica. (Yes, really!) The vintage-looking 
 comes in mint, orange, or white, with a retractable 60mm f/12.7 Leica lens, built-in flash, and an optical viewfinder ($299). A cinch to operate, the camera features several preset modes, like “Party & People” or “Double Exposure,” and spits out textured keepsake prints on standard Fujifilm Instax cartridges or Leica’s own black-and-white instant film (featuring cream-colored borders). It even amps up your selfie game, thanks to a reflector mirror on the front.
 
If taking best-in-class pictures is one of the reasons you travel, then you need to take a high-performance camera. Problem is, many of these are heavy and bulky. The 
 isn’t exactly an exception to the rule—its drop-, dust-, and water-resistant carbon-fiber body weighs almost 2 pounds—but it makes its pro-level competitors look like giants ($1,800).
Among its high-performance features are a precise, fast, 153-point autofocus; dual memory card slots (including a next-gen XQD 2.0 memory card slot for smooth and speedy continuous shooting, even with high-resolution images); and compatibility with a multitude of different lenses. With the D500’s 4K video shooting and inputs for both microphones and headphones, you can consider it your camcorder replacement, too.

=== Title: Best Beers for Summer Picked by America's Top Craft Brewers - Bloomberg ===

This year, in our quest to find the perfect summer beer, we decided to go straight to the source: some of America's most exciting brewers. We asked them to name the favorite summer quencher from their portfolio, along with a refreshing pick from another brewery they revere (i.e., true “brewer’s brews”). F
 
"As a farmhouse brewery, we specialize in producing refreshing blonde ales year-round, so our portfolio offers many options for perfect summertime beers. At the top of that list is Crossfade, a crisp saison that features a harmonious and thirst-quenching combination of hop character, gentle acidity, and Oxbow’s signature dry finish."
"As a Maine resident, I am extremely fortunate to have fresh Allagash White readily available around every corner of this wonderful state. Belgian-style 
 is one of the undeniable champions of warm-weather refreshment, and it can easily be argued that Maine’s very own Allagash White is the finest example in the world."
 
"Aunt Sally is a true dual-fermentation beer made with two exclusive organisms. The first is lactic acid bacteria which convert a small portion of the grain sugars into lactic acid, which is well known in the wine world to be both smooth and velvety. The second is a normal yeast fermentation with our house ale strain. Then we hit it with a massive dry-hop that creates intense citrus and berry notes."
Mort Subite, 
"This is a spontaneously fermented beer that truly exemplifies the statement that 
 is the 'Champagne of Brussels.' Time is the most precious ingredient to Belgian brewers, and good things come to those who wait. Old Gueuze is a blend of mostly 3-year-old beer aged in oak barrels with a small portion of 'young' beer. It is effervescent, tart, funky, and sublimely refreshing."
 
"In Chicago, the weather is pretty weird, and we always look forward to summer so we can enjoy being outdoors. It was in the summer of 2013 when we came up with the idea for our brewery. We had a picnic to celebrate the journey we were about to begin, and fellow brewer Eli Espinoza brought over a batch of a pale wheat ale with rooibos tea in it. We call it Jungle Boogie. It has an orange color with fresh tropical fruits in the nose. It’s juicy, floral, fruity, and has a peachy, lightly sweet hoppiness about it that is very unique."
Half Acre Beer Co., 
"I know spring is in effect and summer is around the corner when I see Half Acre’s Vallejo India Pale Ale cans on the shelf. It’s a Chicago version of a west coast IPA; hoppy, bitter, and to be crushed in a 16-ounce can. I love how Half Acre uses the 16oz. can as a canvas for artwork. Artist Phineas Jones’s design reflects Half Acre’s progressive and forward-thinking aesthetic—something I enjoy as much as the beer itself."
 
"Our Berliner-style weisse beer is the one and only beer we brew only for the warm months. Exilis has an aroma of inviting funk, mixed with citrus tartness, and a flavor profile to match, but with greater depth than you’d ever expect in a beer weighing in only at 3.8 percent alcohol by volume. For a twist on it, add in fruit syrup. We go with our homemade raspberry syrup at the brewery."
 Birrificio Italiano, 
"In a world overrun by juice-bomb IPAs and barrel-aged everything, sometimes it is nice to take a step back and remember how magnificent a truly great lager can be—especially the pinnacle pilsner on the planet, Tipopils. Showcasing a decadent malt bill of predominately pilsner and a hint of caramel malt, it is perfectly balanced by an onslaught of noble hops. It is crisp, refreshing, complex, and easy-drinking, all at the same time. Find this and consume it at any and all costs."
 
"Our interpretation of a hoppy 4.8 percent alcohol-by-volume pale ale, brewed with a rotating dry-hop. On the nose, a mix of tropical fruits and underripe bush berries mixed with a little, dank forest-floor note. Palate is light and airy: crisp up front with some hay and light grain, which give way to a hefty swing of light stone fruit, a slightly herbal citrus note, and a soft kiss of blueberry as the back end softens up."
Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!, 
"Dieu du Ciel! Solstice d’Été is my desert island beer. It's a beer I always try to keep in the fridge, and for good reason. It's a hugely bright 
, akin to a literal raspberry smoothie in fruit character, with a beautifully done acid profile, wonderful carbonation, and an alcohol by volume just higher than one might expect—just an absolutely delicious creation, in my opinion."
 
"One of the first beers to hit kegs in our brewery this summer will be Crispy Little, our hoppy American-style wheat ale. We love brewing beers with heavy doses of wheat, and something about that bouncy texture and bright, snappy flavor that it lends to beers just screams 'Summer!' Crisp, low alcohol by volume, and drenched with grapefruit-y hop character. This one just tastes like sunshine, damnit."
Threes Brewing, 
"Summertime calls for the ultimate in quaff-ability, and that usually means lean pilsner-type beers in our household. We have been obsessed with Threes Brewing's Vliet Pilsner since first tasting it last year, and we can't wait to drink several liters whilst basking in the rays. Vliet is chock-full of gorgeous, citric European hop character and is sure to make beer drinkers reassess what a 'hoppy beer' should taste like."

=== Title: What the Color of Your Luxury Car Says About You and Your Taste - Bloomberg ===

Believe it or not, most luxury cars are not McLaren orange, or even Ferrari red.
They’re “arctic,” or “diamond,” or “fog.” In short: White. Silver. Grey. The feeling, experts say, is that those hues are considered timeless. People like them because they seem sophisticated and elegant. At the very least, they’re inoffensive.
“The manufacturers have learned which colors are most appropriate for their vehicles,” says Eric Ibara, the director of residual value consulting at Kelley Blue Book. “If you stick with the traditional whites and silvers and blacks, then you really can’t go wrong.” 
Boring, maybe. But according to Kelley Blue Book, silver remains the color of choice for luxury vehicles. A full third of all luxury vehicles are silver; another 30 percent of them are diamond, crystal, snow, powder, cream, or some other version of white.
And no matter how much you love the dark side, if you drive a noir Aston or a Bimmer, you’ll be in the minority. Even though it is a popular hue for cars in general, only 8.5 percent of all luxury cars sold last year were black. 
The color of your car indicates a lot about what feelings you consider important and how you perceive yourself. Trends in car colors operate on a much longer time frame than they do for clothing—they'll flip every six or eight years as opposed to every season—but they involve just as much emotion and personalization for those who choose them as any Dior gown.  
“It’s about buying something that makes a statement about your personality,” Cathy Bass, a senior designer for Bentley, says. “When you’re buying a new car, it’s critical.”
“Color induces memory, and it affects your mood—especially when it’s connected to how you express your personality,” says Erin Crossley, the color and trim design manager for Cadillac.
The rules of tone as it relates to personality are common sense: Big, bold colors such as red and yellow are associated most often with sporty, young people and aggressive drivers, Crossley says. Dramatic colors, such as green and teal, connote a “performance aesthetic.” Neutral and faint colors are considered calm and luxurious.
“People equate light colors with soft things,” Crossley says. “If you’re an adrenalin fiend, you’re going to choose red.”
Bass, who has worked as a color expert for 27 years and currently leads Bentley’s program, called selecting a car's color a matter of instinct that is especially delicate when the person spending the money is part of a duo.
“The female companions in particular play an important role in the selection of both the interior and exterior of the car,” Bass says. “A lot of the gentlemen say they’re interested in the engine and the performance, and, ‘I let my wife pick the color.’” 
But there’s more about the color of a car than just telling the world you’re a cool kid or a fast driver. Color also affects value.
According to a Kelley Blue Book 
, if you are trying to sell a car that is painted or lined in an unpopular shade of, say, brown, it will decrease the residual value of your car by hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
“Put simply, today's popular color will probably make your vehicle more popular to a buyer five years from now,” it says. “Less popular colors depreciate your vehicle's value.”
KBB's Ibara says he doesn’t see the tendency toward white changing soon. White communicates timelessness and freshness, which are positive values. If you drive a white car, you’re likely channeling those values, he says.
Teal, on the other hand, was trendy for drivers in the 1990s who wanted to feel quirky or different from the norm. These days Kona and Cinnamon are especially popular (i.e. dark brown and reddish-brown).
“They are colors that have that perfect balance of being expressive and also feeling reminiscent of the leather good products,” Crossley says. “It makes it feel much like a home environment inside the car—expressive without being too over top.”
So are tones that evoke nostalgia. Sherwin Williams 
 that for 2016, “multifamily living is back, and this palette connects across generations: dashing greens and cheeky pinks with a flower power that’s as crisply modern as it is soulfully vintage.”
The tones are reflected in cars.
“Kodachrome or something with a lot of shadow around the edges and black in it [is] very popular with people who are 
 now,” says Bentley’s Bass. “You can see those same elements in fashion magazines like 
 and 
, too, which obviously you can’t do on a flat surface, but you can recreate elements of that to give the car much more depth.” 
Bass scours fashion shows, furniture fairs, magazines, design events, and textile sales looking for hues that reflect what Bentley buyers want. Or more accurately, what they 
 want, since she works on products that won’t see the marketplace for three or four years after their inception. Economic downturns lead to muted, grayer colors, according to the Sherwin Williams report. Upswing years translate to brighter, bolder hues. 
The key to producing a winning color on any level is to land on something that makes people feel at home inside the vehicle. It must complement other colors already and currently in the consumer consciousness, whether they’re on refrigerators, couches, or bathroom mats.
“Colors look dated when people can’t relate to them with the other products and things in their lives,” Crossley says.
Location also determines which colors are popular on a given car. In the U.S., darker tones are always more popular in northern states than they are in the south, where light, pale colors sell better, Crossley says. 
On a global scale, Bentley sells its craziest color combinations (think mint green with cotton-white interior, Hermès orange with ebony wood trim, electric blue with red stitching) in the Middle East, where the blazing sunlight somehow filters differently than it does in dreary England. A vermillion Continental would look terrible in Crewe—but right at home in Dubai. 
The shape of the car matters, too. A yellow minivan has an entirely different vibe than a yellow Miata.
“It’s one thing to love a color and another to know is it right for your car,” says Bass. She should know—Bentley will offer 17 standard exterior options on the new Bentayga, plus 90 color options in its extended range. That doesn’t even include its bespoke and archival color services, which cost a fortune but represent the ultimate way to realize your color fantasy in the body of a car. “You might be emotionally drawn to a brilliant color because you like frogs, but that doesn’t mean you should be driving one.”
Unless it’s a silver frog, of course. 

=== Title: The Utah Desert Is an Off-Road Driver’s Dream - Bloomberg ===

Enjoy the martian scenery around Moab, Utah, by hurtling through its orange cliffs and jarring riverbeds in a four-wheeled mountain goat rig.
The off-road route to take is 
, a 21-mile course about 50 miles south of town. It’s accessible as a quick morning trip but has enough personality to keep even advanced drivers busy all day. (Beginners should take a few lessons first; 
 runs off-roading schools out of four North American locations, including Vermont and California.) The surface shifts from gravel to creek beds to rocks to pavement, and there are multiple high-shelf roads and ledges to maneuver. 
1. Find a vehicle with high clearance, such as a Land Rover Defender, Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen, or Toyota Land Cruiser.
2. Protect the underbody of your SUV with steel skid plates. You can have them installed at most garages. At the very least, cover the gas tank, differentials, and oil pan.
3. Forget street tires. Get a set of all-terrain or mud-terrain ones.
4. Make sure to have a tow hook or trailer hitch on your rig. Just in case.
 
Pictured here is the 
, a totally modern off-roading model built on a 1969 body using all-new dead-stock components. Icon, a Los Angeles-based boutique car company led by builder Jonathan Ward, creates one-of-a-kind machines and specializes in vintage SUVs. The BR’s engine is a fuel-injected 2015 Mustang GT Ford Coyote V8 that gets 412 horsepower and more than 390 pound-feet of torque at its max. Driving it feels like commandeering a tank with a muscle-car heart. Options include sport brakes, front- and rear-locking differentials, a “bikini” style top, and a manual transmission. 

=== Title: El Celler de Can Roca Takes First Place at World’s 50 Best Restaurant Awards - Bloomberg ===

Is 
 the best restaurant in the world?
It is according to 
 magazine, a British food industry publication, which launched its annual 
 awards in 2002. The winners were announced tonight in London, and though there weren't many surprises, there were a couple of newcomers to the top 50, including 
 in Shanghai and 
 in Moscow. The highest-ranking restaurant in the U.S. this year was 
, at No. 5.
The One to Watch award went to Sepia in Sydney, a restaurant already on the list (in 84th place), while this year’s lifetime achievement award went to Daniel Boulud, of 
 in New York, though his restaurant is no longer ranked in the top 50. And while women chefs are notably scarce from the list (generally accounting for no more than 4 percent of the total winners), there is a World's Best Female Chef award, and it went to the Michelin-starred French chef 
. 
There was controversy as a site called 
 launched a petition leading up to the awards, with support from several well-respected chefs, criticizing the lack of established criteria for winners and the lack of transparency and structure in the voting process. Argentine chef Francis Mallmann, who was recently profiled in the Netflix documentary 
, announced that he’d 
 from the jury in 2013.
The annual list is compiled from the votes of 27 regional panels, each with 36 members—a mix of critics, chefs, and other industry professionals who vote online (
 was long a voter). El Bulli won the first year and dominated the No. 1 spot from 2006 to 2009. Noma has previously won four times. Other first-place winners include the French Laundry (2003, 2004), the Fat Duck (2005), and Can Roca (2013).

=== Title: The Five Biggest Stars of This Year's New York Auto Show - Bloomberg ===

=== Title: The Best New Headphones For Travelers - Bloomberg ===

Here are the requirements that every good pair of travel headphones needs to meet: They must be small enough to fit in a carry-on, they must drown out ambient airplane noise (and crying babies), the batteries must last long enough for a trans-ocean flight, and they must have killer sound. Achieving all that is easier said than done.
We tested the best new models on the market to find six pairs that met the mark—no matter where we took them. Just pick the one that best suits your travel style.
 
 ($200)
These totally wireless earbuds—which are like Apple’s AirPods, but better—do a lot more than keep you tangle-free. A built-in heart tracker boosts your morning runs along the beach, and with 4GB of onboard memory, you don’t need your phone handy to play your tunes. And then there’s the sound quality: solid bass, big volume, and better-than-average noise isolation.
 
 ($250)
You can just as easily wear these streamlined, Danish-designed headphones with your suit or with your joggers—but it’s the touch-sensitive controls on the right can and the outstanding battery life (20 hours) that make them perfect for the business set. Use those touchpads to answer calls or hush your music to hear what’s going on around you; the tight-fitting, on-ear design makes for impressive sound isolation even before you ratchet up the adjustable noise cancellation.
 
 ($450)
The plain aesthetic of these seemingly conventional on-ear headphones belies the cutting-edge technology within. They’re the world’s first on-ear planar magnetic headphones, which basically means that the drivers—the main piece of hardware that dictates your sound quality—are three times more powerful than those of its closest competitors, without adding a single ounce of bulk. And that’s just the start. Other specs include a built-in chip with a digital audio converter (DAC), a digital signal processor (DSP), and an amplifier that’s designed for playing high-resolution files (such as those on Tidal). It means that when you listen to your favorite album, you’ll hear layers you never even knew were there.
 
 ($350)
If all you need is knock-out noise-cancelling and extended-wear comfort, go with this wireless upgrade on an old classic. The light, over-the-ear design is secure and sweat-resistant, the faux leather pads don't press too hard, and the powerhouse noise cancellation is always on by default.
 
 ($250)
Go totally hands-free with these second-generation wireless headphones, which automatically answer calls or play music when you put your headphones on and stop playing music when you take them off. Audio is warm and detailed, and an upgraded design with memory foam earpieces makes these more comfortable than ever.
 
 ($130)
If you’re looking for something that falls midway between powerful (but hefty) over your ears and portable (but not quite powerful) earbuds, try this lightweight option. It has the latest Bluetooth 4.2 specs, a water-resistant body, and the full sound—all in a small package that folds up neatly into a pie-slice-size carrying case. It lacks a standard audio input, so you can’t plug it into airplane entertainment systems without an adapter. But there are other pros to compensate. Namely: 40-hour battery life and a “Find My Headphones” feature for the organizationally challenged.
 

=== Title: Where to Eat in Copenhagen Now That Noma Is Closing - Bloomberg ===

A decade ago, you wouldn’t have heard too many people brag about traveling to Copenhagen for the food unless they were on stage doing stand-up. Now, of course, the game has changed. The unofficial statistic around the city is that one in three tourists is there to eat. The restaurant at the top of everyone’s wish list is 
, an almost impossible dream. (Even before it 
at the end of the year, Noma averaged 20,000 calls on the one day each month that it takes reservations.)
Still, if you visited Copenhagen in the past few years, you know that the worldwide obsession with Noma and the New Nordic cooking style it helped champion—hyper-seasonal simple (if sometimes off-beat) ingredients, foraging, etc.—has had a downside. Especially if you were eating in the city for more than a few days and had only a limited appetite for pickled vegetable tops and burnt grains. Food that’s delicious and intriguing for a couple of meals becomes very one note after a while, and you start badly wishing that someone would open up a good Szechuan spot or even a hot sauce stand. And when even bath soaps start using the "New Nordic" label, well, that's a trend that's run its course.
Which is why a September visit to Copenhagen yielded some pleasant surprises. More diverse cuisine is around town now, from elaborate Japanese breakfasts to incredible late-night pizzas topped with just-made mozzarella. Noma itself is evolving. When it reopens in its new location in 2017, in a hippy district with a farm, chef and owner Rene Redzepi promises a different focus. His mantra is hyper-seasonality: He’s dividing the year into three distinct food seasons, not the four we’ve all been brought up to believe in and shop for. Instead, there will be a seafood-focused winter; produce for spring and summer; and a hunting menu for fall.
Here are eight terrific places to eat and drink around Copenhagen now.
 
The original location of this astonishing restaurant is on Denmark's Bornholm island, a little hotspot near Sweden frequently described as the Montauk of Scandinavia. (“You have to visit,” locals will scream at you if you mention Bornholm.) Here at the recently relocated, five-year-old Copenhagen outpost, a battery of chefs work in the wide-open kitchen and take turns delivering such dishes as a
side of salmon that's been both cold- and hot-smoked, served
with pickled figs and cherry blossom vinaigrette. King crab comes with fresh walnuts and fruit juice made with “all the berries we can find,” finished with a butter sauce.
The 18-course prix fixe menu is about $350; the wine pairings are an extra $200. You can choose juice pairings for about $100, or, best of all, have them interspersed with wine and beer throughout the meal.
 
Wine drinkers around the world adore 
. The place has no wine list; instead the staff will help you figure out what wine(s) you want to be drinking and set an open bottle down in front of you. Recently, the owners opened a restaurant around the corner that looks like a groovy, uncrowded Scandinavian furniture shop. At dinner, the menu features non-Scandi staples such as bouillabaisse and steak with smoked bone marrow vinaigrette. In the morning there’s a savory Japanese breakfast with enough little plates and bowls to fill the table, including miso soup, cured mackerel and rice, and chawanmushi egg custard, plus fortifying green juice and coffee.  
Copenhagen has one of the best cocktail bars in Europe; it's called 
. (If you’re looking for Noma cooks after hours, you might well find them here.) Bronnum is the brand new spot from the Ruby team, and it's even grander, a series of six distinct rooms set in a building across from the Royal Theatre that was once a restaurant frequented by Hans Christian Anderson. Bronnum's ambitious 24-drink menu includes the "3 Martini Lunch," a flight of drinks that shows the evolution of the classic from sweet to bone dry, and the aquavit-based Memories of Aalborg, served with a nugget of cheese and hazelnuts that complement its flavors. There’s also a cellar full of Champagne, with Dom Perignon 2006 poured by the glass.
 
Former Noma chef Christian Puglisi has built a mini restaurant empire in Copenhagen starting with the intimate, elegant 
. (Its design, featuring silverware hidden in drawers in the dining tables, has influenced such restaurants as Manhattan's acclaimed 
.) Though he’s a Scandi food star, Puglisi was born in Sicily, and his latest place, Baest, has a big wood-burning oven front and center. He uses fermented flour for his 
topped with mozzarella that’s made several times a day. There’s a list of charcuterie and cheeses produced from the milk of cows that graze 30 miles from Baest. It’s one of the few places that Noma’s pastry chef 
 goes out to in his limited time off. “I love the vibes, and the pizza is banging,” he says. 
One of the hardest reservations to get in Copenhagen is, perhaps unsurprisingly, at a place run by another ex-Noma chef, Matt Orlando. In a graffiti-covered building, Orlando cooks with ingredients from his huge garden. His epitome-of-late-summer dish is tomatoes—an unconventional ingredient in Denmark—made more unconventional with raspberry, wild rose, and burnt pine wood oil (because this is Copenhagen, after all). The chef is terrifically eco-minded: Amass is one Denmark’s most sustainable restaurants, with a new gold organic certification, one of only two fine-dining places in the country to earn that achievement. Likewise, Orlando is launching a food rescue program with the Danish ministry of environment to cut down on food waste.  
It’s been billed as the more casual incarnation of Noma restaurant without Rene Redzepi in the kitchen; he's merely the co-owner now, with one of his former chefs, Kristian Baumann, doing the cooking. Some of the ingredients come from Noma’s kitchen, a block away, but the place has its very own sensibility, with deceptively simple dishes. 
, Bloomberg critic Richard Vines shouted out the raw lamb with last year’s pickles, which he described as "Nordic steak tartare." Vines also liked the braised oxtail, glazed with fermented barley. In fact, Vines says, “The great thing is that 108 doesn’t feel second-best. In fact, the buzzy dining room is more fun than at Noma.”
As if your weekly greenmarket mated with an internationally minded 
, this five-year-old foodie destination
in central Copenhagen has a terrific mix of 60 stands (not unlike the new 
in New York's Grand Central Station). In the outdoor plaza, 
, run by Noma’s ex pastry chef Rosio Sanchez, has a short menu that usually stars carnitas tacos on fresh tortillas. Within the two glass-walled halls, among the cheese and butcher and produce stands, are prepared food kiosks, such as 
, which specialize in glorious open-faced sandwiches topped with thick slices of smoked salmon and beef tartare. And in one corner is an outpost of 
, whose espresso-topped soft serve has a cult following. 
This two-story modern Italian restaurant has been open for a while, but a recent renovation also brought on a rising star chef, Nick Curtin (from Rosette in New York). His lovely dishes include imported buratta with vibrant purple plums and pickled onions; handcut beef tartare with hazelnut oil, burnt lemon, and smoke; and spaghetti alla chitarra with brown butter and trout roe. (Take note: Copenhagen doesn’t have a ton of great pasta.) The short wine list focuses on Italy with a little France and includes some orange wine, too. Spuntino’s five-course menu is less than $50, which constitutes a bargain in Denmark.

=== Title: Latin America's Best Chef Will Open a Restaurant at the Top of the World - Bloomberg ===

For someone obsessed with food terroir and authenticity, Virgilio Martinez is surprisingly tolerant of pre-packaged snacks.
The magnetic co-owner and chef of 
 in Lima, who brought a loudspeaker to the conversation about 
, came by the Bloomberg offices in New York earlier this month to talk about some news in his life. Central had recently landed in the 4th spot on the 
 and was just named No. 1 for Latin America, and Martinez has plans for a new restaurant and food lab that he wants to tell the world about. So it was with trepidation that I escorted him through the sixth-floor Bloomberg lobby, with its many kiosks of free granola bars, chips, cookies, and trail mix.
"Do you want anything?" I asked.
Martinez and his wife Pia, who does most of the cooking at Central, serve not only exclusively Peruvian food; they’ve created a clever strategy for highlighting the diversity of ingredients all over their country. The menu at Central is unlike any other: Dishes are dictated by altitude. The Diversity of Corn, a mix of different corn varieties, along with honey and passion fruit, is marked on the menu with "120 M," or meters of elevation (a modest 400 feet). “People think those are the prices and freak out,” Martinez says. (At 3900 M, the Andean Plateau—a dish made with tunta, or dehydrated white potato, and annatto seeds—would make them freak out more, while the crab plate, Spiders on a Rock, at -5 M would be runaway best seller.) “We cook ecosystems,” is how Martinez describes his cooking style in his elegant, new cookbook, 
.
Anyway, back to Bloomberg and our own food offerings. Martinez and his sister Malena agreed to survey the snacks, so I steered them toward toasted coconut chips, which are at a little tower with other healthy foods. He grabbed a bag, explaining that he had to explore all manner of regional foods as research for Central. "I think I should try these, too," he said with a smile, as he added a packet of baked snap peas to his stash.
Martinez is predicting that Peru's big global food moment, which has been buzzed about for a couple of years now, will arrive eminently. "Peruvian is going to be huge in Asia—maybe it starts in Japan, maybe Korea," he said, noting that several of the chefs working in Central’s kitchen are from those parts of the world. "When they return home, they’ll bring Peruvian cooking with them." He sees it as a phenomenon similar to the 10,000 chefs around the globe who have spread the gospel of Nordic cuisine because they apparently all cooked at Noma. "They write the most romantic letters to come and work at Central," says Martinez. "And they are the most dedicated cooks."
Next year should also be a big one for Central, perhaps its best ever. For one thing, it is moving to the groovy Barranco neighborhood, with its multitude of galleries and hip bars. He promises that the spirit of the place won’t change, but something bigger is needed. They’re adding a bar to accommodate the crowds that come early, before their bookings at the restaurant, and to expand on the terrific drinks (pisco!) that Central already makes. His wife Pia will also open her own restaurant next door, with an à la carte menu that even Martinez doesn’t know much about. “She’s shy, she’s not telling me what she’s doing,” he said, smiling. But he thinks there will be lots of crudo and ceviches and said she’s experimenting with such Andean ingredients as potatoes, corn, and quinoa.
So is Martinez. Next year, he’s going to open a food lab and restaurant in the Andes, on the edge of a plateau of circular garden terraces dating back to the Incas, called Moray. (Some parts of the terraced areas are deep enough that the temperature can fluctuate almost 60 degrees Fahrenheit from top to bottom.)  The place is high up, at 11,500 feet, and remote. Martinez described it: "It's a 45-minute drive into the mountains, and that's after you've taken a one-hour flight from Lima to Cuzco." There, he and his team will research and grow the ingredients that he’s so obsessed with around Peru. “Ten lucky guys will be working there,” he said, along with an array of people such as foragers, botanists, anthropologists, and artists. “There’s a lot of history in a structure like this, but I see the future, too.”
Opening around March, the restaurant will be called Mil (as in thousands, another reference to altitude). Martinez plans on serving up to 60 people at a time in a space with indoor and outdoor seating. He and his crew will cook food found only in the surrounding areas at that high altitude, using only ancient cooking techniques. That means roasting tubers underground with quinoa barks and pachamanca (hot stone)-style, with wild plants for all the corn varieties they'll serve. Martinez envisions guests sitting around the fire pit, eating potatoes—he’ll see how many kinds; Peru produces 4200 
 varieties, approximately half of which come from Cuzco—and multicolored ears of corn that have been cooking on the fire pit coals, with beer. "I see them swimming in a sea of corn," he said. "And then just grabbing an ear and taking a bite."

=== Title: Best New Luxury Safari Lodges: Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Zimbabwe - Bloomberg ===

On an African safari, it's practically a given that you may get a bit dusty tracking lions by day, but you won't be roughing it at night. Yet these days, luxury in the bush is taking on ever greater heights, literally and figuratively. From a high-up vantage point above Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Crater to the first five-star camp in Zimbabwe’s pristine Mana Pools region, these four properties prove there’s never been a better time to be spoiled in the savannah.
Safari outposts in Zimbabwe are booming for many reasons—top-notch guides, ample opportunities for adventure-packed walking and canoe tours, and their relative affordability. The best-kept secret may be Mana Pools, 
 with high concentrations of African wild dogs and a newly minted luxury lodge, the area’s first. Ruckomechi’s 10 tents have glass-walled rain showers with breathtaking river views, often complemented by visiting elephants; a follow-up property called Little Rukomechi has already added four more tents just next door. 
 
The Ngorongoro Crater is one of the few places where you can see hundreds of animal species in a single compact reserve, and the Highlands by Asilia Africa is 
. Its eight geodesic domes—each outfitted with House of Tartan throw pillows, cowhide rugs, and a wood-burning fireplace—are set back from the crowded crater rim. They come with exclusive access to nearby Maasai villages, the flamingo-filled Empakaai Crater, and private picnic sites in Ngorongoro itself.
 
It took 10 years to build this 
, a remote area known for its rhino populations and views of snowcapped Mt. Kenya. The effort paid off: The design is extravagant, with vaulted doorways, a courtyard like those you’ll find in Ethiopian monasteries, crystal chandeliers, and a Turkish hammam. The showstopper is a “constellation suite,” which features an outdoor bed for all-night stargazing. 
 
Throughout its 26-year history, Singita has established itself as the 
in the bush, and the top-to-bottom redo of Lebombo is no exception. The lodge’s 13 glass-walled suites—set in a private, 33,000-acre concession near Kruger National Park—are styled with rattan living room furniture and gauzy canvas canopies over the beds. But it’s the amenities that seal the deal. Follow a leopard-filled game drive with alfresco spa treatments or a dip in the 82-foot lap pool. At dinner, choose a limited-production bottle of South African white from one of the continent’s largest wine collections. 

=== Title: Bugatti Chiron is a $2.61 Million Monster to Attack Land Speed Record - Bloomberg ===

At an exclusive party in Geneva Monday night, Bugatti unveiled the Chiron ("sheer-on"), the 2.4 million euro ($2.61 million) successor to the Veyron. 
On paper and to the casual eye, the car is faster, more powerful, and more beautiful than its chunkier predecessor. Bugatti head Wolfgang Durheimer said even he could barely believe the improvement.
“We asked ourselves, 'What do you do when you have already built the world’s best super car?'” Durheimer said. “Bugatti had to take one further step. It’s hard to believe we have delivered.”
Chiron roars with a 1,500-horsepower, W16 engine pushed by a new, two-stage, turbo-boosting technology; it has 1,600 newton meters of torque and a completely new chassis designed for improved rigidity and handling. Bugatti engineers said it comes with a unique linear power curve that will hit 60 mph in less than 2.5 seconds and 186 mph in just over 13 seconds. (Indeed, anyone who drove even the Veyron can attest to the nearly unsettling jet-like hum and feel of that multimillion-dollar thrust.) Top speed on the dashboard is listed at 500 km/h (311 mph), though they hinted the car will go faster than that.
Durheimer is well known for his devout passion for auto racing and once told me a highlight of his life was watching Bentley set the 
 in Finland in 2011. He said he plans to use his new monster to attack the land speed record: “With Chiron, we will test the limits of physics,” he said.
More pedestrian drivers can choose from five distinct drive modes: the Auto EB mode, for daily driving in regular conditions; the Autobahn mode, which comes with a special top-speed suspension adjustment for highway conditions; the Handling mode made especially for race track fun; the Lift mode, which enables easier access for ramps and garage; and the Top Speed mode, which is activated by a top-speed key and is to be used only in the most extreme circumstances.
During the debut, Bugatti executives emphasized the “beast and beauty … but more beast” nature of the machine. It has a new aerodynamic system that changes according to speed and conditions (the entire rear end is carbon fiber, and the car comes with a carbon monocoque), bigger F1-level brakes on bigger, new 19-inch wheels, and a full titanium exhaust system. They are all performance-driven aspects, but they also curve the car toward beauty by conventional standards, rather than leaving it looking raw and jagged like a massive track machine.
The swooped air vents on the side, elongated fenders, and the square LED lights on the low, wide front face look extreme but well-finished, like a predator that has evolved to combine sheer power with elegant precision.
“Small waist and big hips also works for cars,” one designer said, referencing the iconic Type 57 Bugatti Atlantic as a reference point for the Chiron.
Inside, the car matches its exterior excellence. The dashboard includes an analogue speedometer offset by HMI gauges on the side. Light accents say the word “Chiron” throughout, plus there's a matching set of Bugatti Chiron leather luggage. The
Illuminated C-bar in the interior is the longest light conductor in the automobile industry. “What you see is what you get,” Durheimer boasted, meaning that everything that looks like leather is leather, everything that looks like steel or carbon is steel and carbon.
Maybe that minute attention to detail—combined with world-best performance—is why one-third of the 500-unit production has already been spoken for. They officially go on sale later this fall.

=== Title: How To Make Sure You Get Frequent Flier Status Next Year - Bloomberg ===

With only a few weeks left in the year, it’s time to take stock of your points and miles and make sure you start 2017 with VIP status—at least as far as airlines and hotels are concerned.
From auditing your loyalty-program accounts to leveraging credit-card promotions, there are several ways to earn your gold or platinum status without necessarily going on a mileage run halfway around the world. Here are nine quick and painless strategies to employ before the ball drops on Dec. 31. The more you can squeeze in, the better.
 
Check that you’ve received credit for all eligible flights you have taken with your primary airline 
 its partners; then see how that stacks up against the carrier’s flight and spending requirements. Remember, on carriers such as Delta and United, there are 
 governing how many dollars you need to spend on airfare (in addition to flying a certain number of miles or segments) to earn your elite credentials.
Need a last-minute boost? There’s still time to take a few more flights. But there might be an easier way. Credit cards, including the Delta Reserve from American Express and the Citi/AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCard, will give you elite-qualifying miles in exchange for hitting spending thresholds through the calendar year. Doing all your holiday shopping on the right card could tip you into VIP territory.
 
Hotels calculate your loyalty status based on the number of nights or stays you complete from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31—just as airlines do. But there are two things you may not think to double-check when you’re reviewing your year in travel.
First, make sure that stays at affiliated properties have been counted, then check to see if your co-branded credit card entitles you to any elite-status bonuses. For example, if you have the Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card from American Express, you’re entitled to two stays’ and five nights’ worth of credit toward elite status each year; the Marriott Rewards Premier Credit Card from Chase, meanwhile, offers cardholders a full 15 nights’ credit each year. That’s enough for silver status on its own, so make sure all those credits show up on your account.
 
Don’t lose your miles just because you haven’t flown on a specific airline or stayed with a particular hotel group in a while. Instead, download 
, a free app that keeps track of your points balances and expiration dates.
If you find that some accounts are on their last legs, you can give them a quick jolt—often without spending any money (or time) on flights or stays. Make a token purchase through an airline or hotel’s shopping portal. Dine out at a restaurant partner. Buy something via a co-branded credit card. In general, all you have to do is earn a single point to keep your account alive.
 
Airline and hotel vouchers (such as those you get for being bumped from a flight) have expiration dates, so use them while they’re still good. The same goes for annual travel credits from premium credit cards such as those offered by the 
, Citi Prestige, and the Platinum Card from American Express—use them up by Dec. 31.
 
You’ve already learned that some cards will give you elite-qualifying miles or points for dollars spent. Others go farther, offering elite status or companion tickets just for meeting certain spending requirements during the calendar year. The British Airways Visa from Chase, for instance, offers cardholders who spend $30,000 or more per year a “Travel Together Ticket” that amounts to a two-for-one award ticket. (You can redeem it up to two years later.)
Similarly, the Citi Hilton HHonors Reserve card confers automatic top-tier Hilton HHonors Diamond status on cardholders who ring up $40,000 or more on purchases in a calendar year. If you have a card with such a perk and are close to meeting the spending threshold for it, put on your Santa hat: Generous giving can buy you more than good karma.
 
Don’t have a spending requirement to meet? Get one. Figure out how much you’ll spend on holiday gifts and travel this month, and 
 with a bonus just for making your already-planned purchases.
If you sign up for the Chase Sapphire Reserve, Citi Prestige, or the Platinum Card from American Express before Dec. 31, you’ll get to use their annual bonus credit before the end of 2016 and then 
 in 2017, since these credits are based on the calendar year rather than the card-membership anniversary. Yes, these three cards each come with a $450 annual fee (which is calculated on your membership year, not the calendar year)—but you will also get $400 to $600 in value right off the bat, depending on the card for which you apply, because you can use their annual travel credits now—and then again, as soon as January commences.
The Chase Sapphire Reserve also offers new cardholders 100,000 points when they spend $4,000 on purchases within three months, which you might rack up over the holidays with travel and giving. Or go for the limited-time offer for the Enhanced Business Platinum Card from American Express, whose new cardholders can earn up to 100,000 membership rewards points by spending $15,000 in total within the first three months. (It's a little more ambitious.)
 
Double-dip on some of the strategies above by using an airline or hotel’s online shopping portal. When you log in and click through to a merchant, you’re eligible for earnings multipliers that can triple or quadruple the points or miles you’d make on any given purchase. Merchants can range from Target to Bloomingdale’s and electronics outfitter TigerDirect—making it incredibly easy to take advantage. To compare the bonuses each portal is offering at specific retailers, use a site such as 
.
If you’re likely to lose your status in 2017, now is the perfect time to apply for a match or challenge with a different program. You’ll enter the new relationship with leverage—and won’t have to play by the strict rules applied to those who are starting from scratch.
This strategy works best with hotel programs, which more often match your current status with that of a competitor without imposing minimum stay requirements. Airlines, on the other hand, tend to match your status after you’ve completed a challenge—which usually means taking a couple of flights. Learn about these types of offers  and how to go about asking for them at 
, a message board of sorts for available promotions.
 
If you’re dreading a family visit this holiday season, here’s your silver lining: big opportunities for bonus points or miles. With Marriott’s current “MegaBonus” holiday promotion, for instance, you have two redemption choices: 5,000 bonus points after two paid stays or 10,000 bonus points after 10 nights. It’s valid for stays through mid-January, and you can redeem it multiple times (up to 50,000 points)—as long as you sign up by Dec. 15.
 None of these strategies are exclusive to the year-end period. Use this cheat sheet to close in on your 2017 goals and continue to reorganize yourself with it every few months in the coming year. We promise it will eventually lead to an even more elite 2018.

=== Title: Nine Beautiful New Books About Cars for True Design Fiends - Bloomberg ===

What’s that famous John Waters quote? If you go home with someone and they don’t have books, don’t spend the night?
Something like that.
It's good advice, though I’d offer this addendum: Make sure they have the 
 books.
After all, if you really want to know what’s going on in someone’s head, an analysis of their intellectual diet is the best place to start. For car lovers, this can be a minefield. Auto-themed books for aficionados run the gamut from ultra-cheese and kitsch (
) to boring rundowns on engine variants and pamphlets that are straight brand-boosting propaganda. 
So when someone has the right mix of beautiful 
 smart books about the glories of the Mille Miglia, the gauche opulence of supercars in the 1970s, the indefinable allure of the Pininfarina aesthetic, you know you’ve hit on a promising individual.
If you’re working on starting your own collection, don't just limit yourself to the "Autos" section on Amazon.com. Look everywhere: at art books, photography books, even those big tomes about fashion. Start with titles from boutique and luxury publishers such as Assouline, Taschen, and Phaedon. Here are a few new ones to set you on the right path. 
Rizzoli, $95
This is the definitive monograph on the work of one of the world’s most celebrated car designers, Giorgetto Giugiaro. Giugiaro is noted for such iconic concept cars as the Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta, the De Tomaso Mangusta, the Maserati Ghibli, and the Lamborghini Calà. He was named Car Designer of the Century in December 1999. Anyone who cares about car design should know this man and his considerable repertoire.
Rizzoli, $19.98
Here are 80 idols of the automobile world, including such pioneers of the automotive industry as Henry Ford, superstar car aficionados like Steve McQueen, and celebrated fictional characters such as James Bond. Written by Robert Puyal, an automobile journalist for 30 years, it’s clear, concise, and fun.
Gestalten, $70
The team at Bonhams—used to dealing in the world’s most fabulous cars—put this together as a best-of-the-best collection of their wares. Each page offers a taste of true automobile culture, with large sleek images of sultry bodies and vintage interiors, all in vivid detail. 
Assouline, $845
Only Assouline could do a book this beautiful and complete. The concept is that many people collect, but to collect the ultimate world’s best is impossible. This book does it for you, showcasing the 100 most exceptional cars (in their estimation) of the twentieth century. From the 1909 Blitzen Benz to a 1997 Porsche 993 Turbo S, each car shows a revolutionary design, head-turning capabilities, or both. The book also features cars owned by such stars as Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, and Pablo Picasso.
Assouline, $95
Ken Gross, former executive director of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles and a Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance judge for 25 years, wrote this tribute to the great automobiles of the past and the undeniable allure they retain today. The real beauty here is the exquisite photography by renowned photographer Laziz Hamani. Read it and grasp the revolutionary novelty of the first wheeled machines in history.
Assouline, $845
Everything is here. The singular BMW R7, the 1948 Vincent Series Rapide on which Rollie Free shattered the land speed record in nothing but a bathing suit. The iconic 1969 
 bike that Peter Fonda made famous. And the 1973 Harley-Davidson XR750, Evel Knievel’s favorite bike. Consider this the ultimate unfettered celebration of motorcycle culture and design, a deluxe volume must-have for every motorbike lover and the newest addition to Assouline’s Impossible Collections series.
TeNeues, $95 
The exclusive look at this legendary road race and its A-list drivers. Shot during the 2014 race, this account gets up-close and personal, as you'd never get in real life, thanks to photographs by René Staud. The result is an enthralling depiction of cars, landscapes, and celebrity drivers.
TeNeues, $125
A total look at the seminal designs from the legendary Italian design firm. Accompanied by spectacular concept drawings and photographs of Pininfarina's best projects for Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, and Maserati, among others.
TeNeues, $39.95
This is the work in which Rainer W. Schlegelmilch captured the total ‘70s-era explosion of automotive creativity with his unique photographic eye. Schlegelmilch's styling made the angular concept car silhouettes match the curvaceous forms of the models. It all comes off as very of the time—and all the better for it.

=== Title: You'll Never Guess It's A Mercedes: Inside the 1970 Mercedes-Benz C111 - Bloomberg ===

This 
 is the perfect opportunity to explore some of the more unusual cars in history. 
For example, I was quite excited to drive the 1970 Mercedes-Benz C111. Merc made only 15 of them, and only one of the existing 10 is drivable today. 
The concept is special because for years it served as a test mule for then-futuristic automotive technologies: turbo-charging, Mercedes-patented gullwing doors, sport suspension and air conditioning. 
The best part is it doesn't look anything like what you'd expect from a Mercedes. Watch the video for more. 
 

=== Title: World Debut: The Bentley Bentayga SUV - Bloomberg ===

Bentley has finally unveiled the 2016 Bentayga.
The much-hyped SUV has been in the works since 2012; Bentley chief Wolfgang Durheimer has long promised it’ll be the fastest, most powerful, most luxurious and most exclusive SUV ever made.
Driving impressions remain to be seen, but on paper, at least, it looks as though he has kept his word.
Bentley’s 6.0-litre W-12 behemoth will muster 600 horsepower and 663 foot pounds of torque over its four-wheel-drive, eight-speed, automatic transmission. It’ll go to 60 mph in four seconds and hit a top speed of 187 miles per hour. (That beats the Porsche Cayenne Turbo S by roughly 10 mph and the Mercedes-Benz GLE 63 S AMG by about 13 mph.)
After some redesign following harsh criticism about its bulbous nature when it was first introduced, the Bentayga now has sharp, aggressive features, such as four brilliant LED headlamps hung near the large diamond matrix grille and a serious skid plate in the lower section of the front bumper below the floating wing motif. There’s a panoramic window that covers 60 percent of the roof and silver letter Bs incorporated in the air vents, the wheels, the grill, and all over inside. 
Bentayga comes with eight drive modes, each tailored to specific driving conditions and preferences. The idea is to cosset you in such a cocoon of luxury that you’ll feel at home in the Mojave desert 
 on Park Avenue.
Bentley has also incorporated an all-new direct- and indirect-fuel injection system that switches between the two methods to achieve lower emissions and higher fuel efficiency. This SUV gets 12 percent better mileage over any of Bentley’s previous models. Diesel and hybrid versions will go on sale in the next few years.
Each Bentayga will be handmade in Crewe, England, by third- and fourth-generation workers who spend hours stitching, polishing, and refining even the littlest detail inside.
The car comes with a choice of four or five seats covered in hides taken from bulls bred in the Alps and tanned with all-natural ingredients. Each one is individually selected and inspected for blemishes and defects. Bentley will offer 15 different colors of leather, plus dozens of combinations with exotic woods and gleaming brushed metal trim.
Other details include a Breitling tourbillon clock on the dash with a choice of either a pearl or black ebony face and eight diamonds embedded inside. There’s an 8-inch, crystal-clear touch screen and infotainment system with a rear-seat tablet that has 4G Wi-Fi and a Naim surround sound system. The unmistakable Bentley diamond stitching is everywhere inside, including inside the ski hatch that goes through to the hands-free tailgate in the rear. You can even choose to have Bentley make you a matching picnic hamper complete with a refrigerator, Linley China cutlery, crystal glasses, and a storage area for dry foods. 
The general feeling is one of comfortable, presumed wealth. The details seem neither outré nor outrageous; they’re naturally splendid.
Bentley also offers bespoke services created by the craftsmen at the shop in Mulliner. There, if you can foot the bill, they’ll create the coolest SUV you can imagine. Popular add-ons include wooden cabinets to hold watches and jewels, cigar humidors, gun safes, bullet-proofing, and leather dyed to match favorite articles of clothing.
The effort is a key part of parent-company Volkswagen’s master plan to bump Bentley’s output to 15,000 units sold in the next three years. (Last year it sold just over 11,000 worldwide; 
 they’ll make approximately 3,000 Bentaygas next year alone.) China and other BRIC markets are particular targets for the new rig, since rough roads and other geographical and safety hazards can characterize their driving conditions. 
Bentley has declined to name pricing yet for the Bentayga, but a base model will start in the mid-$200,000 range. Deliveries begin early next year. 
 

=== Title: You Can Now Buy the World’s Best Steaks for $180 a Pound - Bloomberg ===

After you’ve had the best croissants in Paris, the local bakery just doesn’t cut it any more. That can happen with steaks, too—it did for me four years ago, after an incredible dinner in Italy.
It was in the tiny town of Panzano, a Tuscan speck roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Florence, where a series of switchbacks and impossible-to-follow road signs eventually led to the carnivore’s paradise of 
. That’s where Dario Cecchini, the cattle rancher-turned-chef-turned-beef poet, churns out nightly communal dinners that feature beef, beef, and more beef: namely, his signature, raised-on-premises Florentine and Panzanese cuts. He practically sings to the steaks as they grill over a roaring fire, raising and lowering the cooking surface with pulleys to achieve the optimal effect. Everything about it was theater, the butcher incarnate of Beatrice leading diners to the ninth sphere of heaven.
I thought, after that glorious Italian evening, that I was done forever. And while it took me four years to find another steak as tender and full of flavor, I now know that it’s possible to recreate steak nirvana at home. If you live in Los Angeles, anyway.
That’s where the celebrity chef Curtis Stone and his brother, Luke, have opened 
, a restaurant and butcher shop featuring an ingredient as rarefied as Cecchini’s Panzanese: 
.
Stone, who trained under London’s legendary chef
 before becoming a television personality on TLC’s 
 and Bravo’s 
, is the only chef currently bringing the rare Australian steaks to North America. He’s also the first to sell them here—and had to secure a distributor license to do so. (Blackmore has distributors in 13 other countries; 
 for details.) Soon, he says, he’ll be purveying them to other well-known chefs around the country—but the details on who and when are still in the works.
“There are only a few world-class butcher shops in the world, and there’s never been one in Los Angeles,” Stone said during an interview at Bloomberg’s New York offices. Unlike other high-concept butcher shops that focus on whole animal or organic specimens, Stone’s philosophy is simpler: “We’re simply prioritizing the most delicious cuts in the world,” he said.
In pursuit of that goal, Stone and his team tasted 20 of the best grain-fed beefs to find a favorite. (He will also carry grass-fed varieties but considers grain-fed to be of premium quality.) The winner: Australian Blackmore Wagyu, a pure breed of cattle devised by the Victoria-based cattle farmer David Blackmore.
“Blackmore has literally redefined the way the Aussies think of meat,” said Stone, explaining that steaks were once graded on a scale of one to six. Blackmore’s first score? A six out of six. “[Japanese graders] had to change the way they graded steaks to a nine-point scale because Blackmore kept outdoing himself,” Stone added.
For those concerned with sustainability, Stone offers an optimistic outlook. “All the humane cues go hand in hand with creating the best tasting steaks,” he said, noting that Blackmore and his cohorts in the premium cattle farming industry use balanced diets and fair husbandry practices as key ingredients for delicious steaks.
Blackmore is developing a new benchmark program called “Eco-feeding,” which encompasses natural and nutritional feed lots, appropriate weaning time for young animals, and humane environmental standards. Plus, added Stone, “Australia has never had mad cow disease, so they’re able to ship their [bone-in] products to the U.S.”
If you're not looking to live within striking distance of Victoria, you can get your taste of Blackmore beef at Gwen, Stone’s restaurant, where the menu includes such items as a 42-ounce bone-in ribeye for two ($390). Or you can buy it from Gwen’s butcher shop and prepare it in your oven or grill at home—Stone provided us with a 
. Cuts range from Wagyu grind ($22 per pound) to ribeye ($99 per pound) and tenderloin ($180 per pound).
Among the chef’s tips for preparation: Season simply, with Maldon salt and, optionally, freshly cracked pepper; rotate the steak every few minutes for even, sous-vide-like cooking; and serve with nothing but a drizzle of olive oil. (The acidity is a welcome touch.)
You’ll be left with a steak that’s tender and buttery beyond compare. The flavor is unadulterated in a way that reminded me of biting into an heirloom tomato. “This is what steak is supposed to taste like,” I thought, bite after bite after bite.
One day, Stone hopes to make the steaks available for mail order in the U.S.—the demand, he says, would make it a profitable venture. But Blackmore’s production is still small and limited, so in-person orders in Los Angeles are the best course for now. 

=== Title: The Most Instagrammed Luxury Hotels of 2016 - Bloomberg ===

If you’re using 
 as a way to figure out where the cool kids are traveling, expect to be steered to the largest hotels on earth. At least that’s the indication based on this year’s list of most Instagrammed luxury hotels, which the company has shared exclusively with Bloomberg. All the properties on the list were classified as five-star stays, but they didn’t earn their spots on this list by virtue of their excellent service or comfortable beds. They’re not purveyors of exclusivity or gateways to glamorous cities, but mega-destinations unto themselves. Forget Instagrammable moments—these hotels are Instagrammable universes. So here’s what not to miss when you inevitably plan your own trip.
 
The 
 in the world is hands-down Las Vegas’s coolest. Go for drinks at the property’s burlesque-inspired 
 bar and make sure you’re booked into one of 21 brand-new Boulevard Penthouse suites, which start at a massive 2,000 square feet and include private gaming salons.
 
As if the 113-acre 
 wasn’t already big enough, it’s spawning a sibling resort called The Royal Atlantis next year with 44 floors and 800 rooms. The crown jewel of the $1.4 billion project will be its duplex bridge suite, with a glass-bottomed pool that will literally hover between two sections of the building. But until that opens, you’ll have to settle for a glass-walled underwater room that’s submerged in the stingray-filled Ambassador Lagoon.
 
There’s still time to get this year’s most coveted 
 Instagram: The hotel is hosting Justin Bieber for its New Year’s Eve celebration. But that just speaks to the nightlife prowess at this Miami Beach institution: It’s where you’ll find epic clubs such as Liv, plus such lounge-y restaurants as Hakkasan and Michael Mina 74.
 
Lots of visitors Instagram the Chihuly ceiling at the Bellagio when in Vegas, but the flower displays at the 
 are even more eye-catching (where social media are concerned). That’s your money shot, but there’s another, lesser-known photo opp you should hit up, too. The Lake of Dreams show, centered around a lit-up, 40-foot waterfall, runs nightly on the half hour—like the Bellagio’s fountain, but hipper. (Do you sense a theme?)
 
The fact that 
 makes the top 10 list is a truly impressive feat, given that it’s  open only during the summer season. But it’s where you’ll find Avicii and David Guetta pretty much every Sunday and Monday night next summer—so you know it’s likely to appear on next year’s list, too. Don’t even think about Instagramming the rooms here. If you’re not shooting the scene, a snap of the oysters at the seaside champagne bar is 
.
 
Those ubiquitous photos of the Grand Canals are mind benders: Are you in Vegas? Italy? Certainly not Asia. So have some fun with your followers and include some Chinese signage in your shot of the 
—it’s what will set it apart. Then go shopping for Celine handbags at the duty-free shops and pose (with swag) in front of the Eiffel Tower replica—you’ll really throw your audience for a loop.
 
Here’s the strategy for winning at 
: Head straight to Carbone, where everything is served with a heaping side of dramatic effect, be it the Caesar Alla ZZ (tossed tableside) or the sticky sweet Cherry Pepper Ribs (a dish with foodie cred). It’s as much a theatric experience as O, the Cirque de Soleil production that plays four nights a week near the Poker Room and the Buffet.
 
Since it’s really a complex of nine hotels (and 20 pools and 21 restaurants and 19 bars), it’s no wonder 
 gets lots of traction on social media. Focus your attention on the Cove Club, the most luxurious place to stay on site. Then wake up early and grab a spot on the bright red daybeds that float in the middle of the Cove’s 9,000-square-foot pool for the best photo opp anywhere on the island.
 
In keeping with Hard Rock’s roots, 
 Music Lab lets you get into a recording studio for a day—perhaps in hopes of hitting it big on YouTube. Not your jam? Hit the moon pool at cocktail hour for a #sunset shot that tops the charts.
 
 
It’s all about the views at 
—set in a sailboat-shaped building right on the edge of the Barceloneta boardwalk. Request a high-floor room that faces both the city and the ocean—or get your ’gram from the rooftop bar instead.

=== Title: David Chang on How Ando Delivery Could Save Restaurant Dining - Bloomberg ===

David Chang is piling food from cardboard delivery containers onto a large plate for me.
The founder of the game-changing Momofuku restaurant empire spoons a mound of shimmering dan dan noodles, doused in red Sichuan oil, onto the only empty corner left on my dish. It coils between a catcher’s mitt-size piece of fried chicken and a Philly cheesesteak sandwich, the latter offering the salty promise of a perfect cheese sauce gently nudging out of it.
I’m excited, but a little confused—and overwhelmed. This is not how food delivery normally works; the best thing about it is you can get lots of different kinds of food, but usually it's just one genre at a time.
And yet for Chang, this plate full of highlights from Ando, his new NYC-based food delivery service, has profound meaning.
“Growing up in suburban Virginia, going to the mall was the highlight of the week. This is essentially the greatest hits of the food court,” says Chang. “I’d go with my friends and we’d each get one dish—Asian noodles, cheesesteak—and assemble them on the table. This is a dream plate.”
“Yup,” says J.J. Basil, chef and head of development at Ando, and another child of the Virginia suburbs. “When you put it together, it makes sense.”
There’s another way to look at the plate, besides with happy nostalgia, and that’s as the next generation of food delivery: a virtual restaurant.
Starting on Wednesday, Sept. 7, Ando enters Phase Two of its expansion, by adding menu categories to its app and website 
.
Anoop Pillarisetti, Ando’s general manager, explains these new genres vis-à-vis the food on my plate. The dan dan noodles and mapo tofu will fall in a section titled "Wok," alongside dishes like General Tso’s Chicken. 
Another category is "Bodega." It’s a catchall for dishes like the fried chicken and cheesesteak, as well as banh mi.
The last category is the most compelling: "Lab."
“It’s an experimental test kitchen,” says Pillarisetti. Choices include vegetarian fried rice; chef Basil deepens the flavor of it by adding bonji, a fermented seasoning. There's also a supersonic version of the traditional deep-fried crab Rangoon dumpling; this iteration is a spring roll with mashed potatoes mixed in to lighten up the cream cheese filling.
People can give feedback on the Lab dishes, helping determine what makes it onto the Ando menu. What’s more, those who order and interact the most with the Ando team can “unlock” secret dishes. Chang and Basil talk in hushed tones about a deep-fried cheesesteak that might soon be available to top customers.
Still, what Chang believes makes Ando singular in the world of food delivery is the food itself. He chose a chef who has experience unlike most delivery cooks: Basil trained at Noma in Copenhagen, RyuGin in Tokyo, and WD-50 in New York. At Ando, he works as an R&D chef, reverse-engineering dishes to make sure they're as good—or better—after they’re delivered.
The bonji in the fried rice is not a typical delivery-food ingredient. When Chang decided to put a Philadelphia cheesesteak on Ando’s menu—as the kind of dish that people crave when they're hungry, and therefore ideal for delivery—Basil made countless versions until he found one that had plenty of cheese sauce but not so much that the sandwich bread was a soggy mess after delivery.
“It looks like a traditional cheesesteak, and we’re not trying to mess with Philadelphia,” says Chang. “So I call it an NYC cheesesteak. We added chickpea hozon [a miso-like condiment] because hozon has notes of pecorino and parmesan and gives the sauce a fuller, more delicious flavor.” Chang firmly believes that Basil, or a chef like him, has the potential to be one of America’s great new chefs.
For that to be any more than a dream, people have to be able to taste the food, which is where it gets trickier. One drawback for Ando has been its slow rollout. Having launched in May, Ando’s delivery is still available only in Manhattan’s Midtown East district and slowly expanding westward. It’s not often that midtown has a culinary edge on places like Brooklyn, but for Ando, lunch-desperate midtown is delivery-food ground zero.
One reason Ando is so well-focused is that Chang has been working on the idea for more than a decade. He credits a well-known friend, chef Mario Batali, with planting the idea for Ando in his head. When Momofuku Noodle Bar opened, the lines were soon two and three hours long. One of the first loyal customers was Batali. “He never waited on line,” says Chang. “Not because he was a celebrity—because we never let anyone cut—but because he would come early for lunch. And he’d complain, ‘Why can’t I get this for dinner? I just want this delivered.’ ”
“Of course, I listen to Mario,” Chang continues. He hung out at Batali’s pizza place Otto and saw that it was doing new things in the world of food delivery, like wrapping its cured meat in paper and stuffing it into architecture tubes, for neat and stylish delivery. “They were selling full meals,” says Chang. “And they weren’t selling food that wasn’t supposed to be delivered. Their No. 1 pizza at Otto had an egg on it, but they wouldn’t sell that pizza for delivery.”
That idiosyncratic strategy helped convince Chang not to deliver the dishes that crowds lined up for at Noodle Bar. “I didn’t want to rob the individual that was waiting in line so patiently for their food when someone could literally be eating it in their boxers, complaining that the ramen wasn’t that good,” he says. (He allows that they will have Momofuku delivery when he can be sure the technology and the food will be great.)
“The future of dining in New York, and maybe America at large, is certainly going to be affected by delivery,” Chang says. “If mobile technology has already changed how you get your mail and your dry cleaning and everything else, of course it’s majorly disrupting how people get their food.”
On top of changes in technology, the increasing costs of labor and real estate make restaurants a prohibitively expensive proposition. Still, Chang is old school. “I’m committed, more than ever, to improving my brick-and-mortar restaurants,” he says. “I believe in that dining experience; it’s why I exist and it’s not going to go away. If anything, experiential dining is going to be more important. If front-of-the-house staff have fewer customers to focus on, they can shower more attention on the guests that do come into the restaurant.” He is, at least for now, determined that Ando won’t injure or kill restaurant culture.
But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have plans for more delivery models. He points out that Chinese food, which increasingly dominates Ando’s menu as it evolves, is the No. 2 delivery-food option in the country; the No. 1 choice is pizza. Would Chang consider going head-to-head with the legions of pizza delivery places in New York? “I have a lot of pizza dreams,” Chang says, and laughs. “I can’t wait for Batali and all my Italian chef friends to feel threatened. But we’re going to hold off on that for now and focus on Ando.”

=== Title: Design and Sleep In Your Own Bespoke, Pop-Up Hotel - Bloomberg ===

For your next vacation, forget about taking inspiration from Instagram. You’re going to go where nobody has been before, on a trip that nobody has ever taken—and that nobody after you will ever take again.
That’s the promise of 
, a new ephemeral vacation service that the high-end travel outfitter 
 is launching Thursday. Here’s how it works: You pick a country or region, and Black Tomato will find a pristine parcel of land on which to build you a fully customized pop-up hotel, complete with staff and meals and excursions. You choose everything from the view to the bed linens to the bottles in your pop-up wine cellar. It’s tailor-made travel in the most literal way ever.
“People use the words ‘tailor made’ so ubiquitously these days. What does that even mean anymore?” said Tom Marchant, co-founder of Black Tomato, who conceived of Blink as a response to the traction he saw from pop-up retail concepts. “Temporary experiences really excite people,” he said. “They create a sense of urgency.”
For Marchant, this is the direction that luxury is moving in. He says his personal definition of luxury is something that’s truly unique and can’t be replicated, and hoteliers far and wide agree. But there’s only so much customizing that a hotel can pull off. “Bespoke bath amenities” will be bespoke to a property’s design, not to the guests’ individual wishes; “customized excursions” are often just tweaks to tried and true itineraries.
But those who create a trip using Blink will have—by Marchant’s calculations—751,074,508,800 total trip combinations to choose from after all the granular details are factored in.
So where to begin? An epic location. Black Tomato has built its name off exceptional access to remote places, and Marchant’s team has spent roughly 18 months laying the groundwork for this new project. “Blink is available anywhere in the world,” Marchant said—and he means it. (Yes, that includes the Arctic.) But he and his team will inspire clients with such far-flung and exotic locations as the salt flats in Bolivia or Australia’s Kimberly region. Safari-goers might set up in Namibia or the Kalahari; culture fiends can head to Rajasthan or Myanmar’s Inle Lake; and action fanatics can choose from ski trips in Switzerland, northern lights spotting in Iceland, or riding the sand dunes in the Moroccan desert. These are all among Marchant’s favorites—and hardly compromise an exhaustive list.
Once the general location is set, travelers can get into the nitty gritty of designing their pop-up hotel from the ground up. In an effort to leave no trace behind, Marchant chose semipermanent (but high-design) tents as the format for all Blink pop-ups, but you can choose from a variety of styles: canvas, domes, bubbles, yurts, tropical villa tents, and a few more. Then everything from the layout of the beds (yes, real beds) to the patterns on the seat cushions and the brand of bath amenities is up to your personal whim.
The process can take place online—Marchant likened the experience to “choosing from a room service menu”—or over the phone with an expert, though he also clarified that guests can be as hands-on or hands-off as they want to be. (Even the customization process is customizable.)
Depending on the remoteness of the location and how established Black Tomato is in that area, it can take three to five months to execute a client’s vision. Not only does it require a logistical superstorm to get all your preferences lined up and installed on site; Black Tomato also has to staff each camp individually. For some guests, that might mean daily housekeeping and a couple of great guides; for others, it could mean a sommelier, chef, and an astronomer for expert-led stargazing sessions. Blink trips include meals, excursions, transfers, and everything in between. “We create the full package,” Marchant explained.
Blink took a lot of work to get off the ground—but it will quickly become a well-oiled machine, Marchant hopes. Black Tomato expects to start small, commissioning roughly 10-20 trips in the service’s first year and ultimately scaling it into the hundreds. “We have the infrastructure to support growth on this,” Marchant assured, but he also recognized that it’s not a trip that everyone can (or will) take. “It’s not a mass proposition—it’s about the right people at the right time in the right place.”
As for the pricing, that’s fully bespoke, too. According to Marchant, prices can range from $65,784 for a group of six that wants to spend three nights in Morocco to $177,600 for a group of six spending four nights in the Bolivian salt flats. “Neither of these are including airfare, but Black Tomato can arrange flights from anywhere in the world,” he said.
And while these sample bills were both representative of group trips, Blink is as appropriate for couples as it is for larger affairs. “I can see a lot of proposals and engagements happening with Blink,” Marchant half-joked. “The concept works on many levels: honeymooners looking for the ultimate secluded and private experience, family groups looking to celebrate a milestone event or birthday, groups of friends looking to escape together.” After all, it’s as easy to create a single tent as it is to set up five domes or bubbles in a row for your own private pop-up lodge.
Regardless, each camp will be dismantled as soon as you leave—removing every last trace of its existence—and it’ll never be built the same way again. In other words: Blink, and you’ll miss it. “That’s what gets the hairs on the neck standing up,” said Marchant. “Right now travelers just talk about hotels and Airbnb. Just wait, in 10 years’ time there’s a chance people will be talking about this—semi-permanent tents—instead.”
 

=== Title: Perfect Summer Road Trip: Skyline Drive in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley - Bloomberg ===

Virginia's Skyline Drive, a 76-year-old national scenic byway that runs along the Blue Ridge Mountains, is traditionally driven during autumn, when it’s popular with foliage seekers. But the warmer months offer their own pleasures. Azaleas bloom in June, trillium and bluebells in July, black-eyed Susans and goldenrod in August. The 105-mile road runs the entire length of 
, hitting an elevation of 3,400 feet. There are 75 overlooks along the route, which winds through forests that are home to hawks, wild turkey, deer, and black bears. Enter the park from I-66 in the north, from I-81 in the west, or from I-64 in the south. For the best driving experience, pick something smooth, such as 
(pictured), or something sporty, like the Porsche 911. Both handle the turns athletically and cruise easily along the straight stretches. Don’t expect to blow your way through, as the speed limit tops out at 35 mph. It’s just as well—you’ll get a better look at the wildflowers along the way. 

=== Title: Top Sommeliers Reveal the 20 Wines You Need to Drink This Fall - Bloomberg ===

Like everything else in the summer, wine drinking is easy. And the answer to every question, at least the wine-related ones, 
. But now that fall is here, it’s time to get to more serious drinking. It turns out that cooler weather does indeed translate into bigger wine sales.
“People dig deeper and buy more serious [read: expensive] wines in the fall and early winter,” noted Robert Bohr, co-owner of 
 in New York.
He’s one of seven of the country’s best sommeliers from around the country who told us what we should be drinking this fall. At least one, Chicago’s Ryan Arnold, surprised us. One of his wines is Italian rosé. “It’s no longer seasonal,” he declared. “Rosé is for all year long.” 
 
"I love drinking wine in the fall. You can still enjoy lighter ones, but the denser and earthier wines really become satisfying with a little snap in the air."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

=== Title: Ferraris Lead the Pack at $390 Million Pebble Beach Car Auctions - Bloomberg ===

 Ferrari led the pack again.
The Italian sports cars accounted for seven of the top 10 sales at auctions in California that fetched $390.6 million.
The sales were part of a six-day auto extravaganza that ended Sunday in the coastal towns of Carmel and Monterey and at the Pebble Beach golf course. The preliminary tally fell short of $402.6 million in equivalent sales last year, according to Hagerty, a Traverse City, Michigan-based insurer and classic car 
 that tracks auction results.
Prices for classic cars are leveling off following a period of record sales driven by expanding global wealth. While demand for Ferraris is still strong, even these cars felt the pinch. The top lot this year was a $17.6 million Ferrari, compared with 2014, when a Ferrari 250 GTO Berlinetta fetched $38.1 million, a record for a car sold at auction globally.
This year, 128 Ferraris were offered -- the largest number ever at classic car auctions -- and 25 percent didn’t sell, according to Hagerty. The totals provided by Hagerty include post-auctions’ private sales but exclude sales at a smaller company, Rick Cole.
“Buyers are highly selective, even if it’s a new buyer with all the money in the world,” said McKeel Hagerty, chief executive officer of Hagerty. “Overpaying for a car can be embarrassing later.”
RM Sotheby’s sold the week’s top lot: a red 1964 Ferrari 250 LM, one of 32 of its kind, for $17.6 million, a record for the model.
The car was part of a private collection of 25 automobiles that included other Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bugattis. The group took $75.4 million, setting a record for a private collection sold during a single-day auction. The previous $66 million record for the category was set last year at Bonhams.
An orange 1998 McLaren F1 sports car sold for $13.8 million. A 2005 Ferrari Enzo, built as a gift for Pope John Paul II, fetched $6.1 million.
RM Sotheby’s said it tallied $172.7 million during the week, including post-auction private sales. The biggest disappointment was a yellow 1960 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Berlinetta Competizione which was estimated at $17 million and failed to meet its reserve price. The car didn’t sell privately as of Sunday, according to an RM Sotheby’s spokeswoman.
A red Ferrari led the sales at each of the three major auction houses.
“Ferraris are like Patek Philippe watches,” said Doug Wolford, chief executive officer of Convergent Wealth Advisors, a Potomac, Maryland-based wealth management firm with $6 billion in assets under management. “There will always be people who want them.”
A red 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider -- one of only 37 of its kind -- fetched $16.8 million at 
 on Sunday, within the estimated range. Gooding said it sold $128.1 million of cars.
 sold a 1959 Ferrari 250 GT Competizione Alloy Berlinetta, a sports car that placed third at the 1959 Tour de France car race, for $8.5 million. It had an estimate of $9 million to $12 million. Bonhams said its sales totaled $46.7 million.
Ferraris weren’t the only popular cars on the block. A 1956 Fiat Eden Roc, which was designed to drive people from a house to a beach, hammered for $660,000. With no doors and no roof, the sleek, cream-colored vehicle resembles a boat on wheels. One of only two made, it has mahogany bumpers and a wraparound rear seat. The car ferried three pretty, young women as it entered the saleroom for its auction debut.
Another Fiat -- a 1953 green-blue Fiat 8V Supersonic that had the same owner for 36 years -- sold at Bonhams for $1.8 million, matching its low estimate. A 1953 Jaguar C-Type Works lightweight roadster fetched $13.2 million at RM Sotheby’s, a record for the model.
By the end of Sunday, six auction houses sold 803 of the offered 1,386 lots, representing a 58 percent sell-through rate and average sale price of $479,557. That’s a decline from last year’s average of $540,366 and 61 percent sell-through rate, according to Hagerty.

=== Title: Searching for Steelhead in Terrace, Northern Canada’s Fly-Fishing Hub - Bloomberg ===

There are few things capable of instilling both inner peace and heart-pumping adrenaline within the span of a split second. Swinging flies for powerful spring-run steelhead is certainly one of them.
Secluded along the banks of the mighty Skeena River near the Alaska border, Terrace, B.C., is renowned among Canada’s West Coast guides as the steelheading capital of the world. These salmon-size sea-run rainbow trout divide their time between the fast-flowing rivers of the Northwest and the Pacific Ocean. Here, prolific river systems cut their way through snowcapped mountains into the valleys below. Many of the town’s 12,000 permanent residents rely on the seasonal influx of fishermen for their livelihoods.
Late summer and fall are your best bet for chinook salmon, while fall and winter provide the best opportunities to land leviathan steelhead. I came in late May, when I joined Michael Menten, a longtime friend turned Vancouver-based fishing guide, on his 16-hour scouting mission north. (Daily two-hour commercial flights are also available.)
Inexperienced outdoorsmen venturing into this territory alone court disaster—bears roam the riverbanks, cougars, and wolves prowl the forests. Winter anglers must contend with avalanches. What’s more, accessing the pristine waters can be extremely difficult. In many cases, roads are nothing more than fantasy, while the rivers’ torrid flows can make boating impossible to all but the most experienced.
Cue Todd Scharf, a veteran guide and local legend. Along with his wife, Satu, Scharf owns and operates 
, an all-inclusive fishing outfitter that’s become a favorite of the banker set.
Set back from the road on the outskirts of town and partially framed by mature Douglas firs, Upstream’s Terrace lodge is a quintessential fishing base camp: log-built, comfortably furnished with high-ceilinged dining and living rooms (to accommodate the 14-plus-foot spey rods Scharf has on display), a modern kitchen and bar, and three private bedrooms on the upper floor. After a day on the water, guests can kick back in a Muskoka chair on a sprawling cedar deck, or lounge, drink in hand, in the outdoor hot tub, views of the Kalum River valley beyond and the fresh scent of evergreen on the breeze.
Cutting his teeth more than a decade ago on the tributaries of the Fraser River, Scharf moved his guiding business to Terrace in the mid-2000s, bringing with him a wealth of fly-fishing know-how. An impressive arsenal of jet boats, rafts, and trucks and the services of a local helicopter operator allow Upstream’s expert guides access to the best and most secluded waters around—for about $1,000 a day, all-inclusive. Guests can expect meticulous coaching on where to cast, as well as lunch, prepped by the lodge’s in-house chef.
Since Scharf and Menten go way back, we camped on the lawn, using Upstream as a base camp for individual expeditions. An “honor among fishermen” thing. But Scharf’s guarantee remained the same: “I grew up on these rivers—we will find fish.”
When it comes to fishing, specifics are the most valuable currency, and for the first few days of our trip we had none. Scharf was away on business, so we started blind, aside from some general directions from a friendly gas station attendant (plus an admonishment to “nut up or shut up, fishing good” when we called Scharf, nervous about the unseasonably warm weather).
Our initial focus was the Kitimat River, a more manageable watershed by local standards, with a road loosely charting its course making access possible for first-timers like us.
The first day of any fishing trip is always the most suspenseful, and as we donned our waders next to a beat of bountiful-looking water, the apprehension in the air was tangible. Reports of high snowmelt and blown rivers the length of coastal British Columbia had seriously shaken our confidence—the risk of planning a springtime trip.
Menten made the first pass, methodically stripping line off his reel as he deftly propelled his fly out over the current. Two-handed spey casting is the gold standard in these parts, and while Menten was well versed in this technique, I was a complete novice. In an instant, I found myself gift-wrapped in tangled fly line. While I struggled to free myself, Menten’s voice pierced the early morning air: “Fish on!” he yelled, as a flash of chrome scales erupted on the surface.
In a fit of euphoric panic, I staggered back to shore, shouting words of encouragement between curses, still hopelessly tangled in my own line. After a lengthy battle (during which I was finally able to free myself), Menten corralled the fish into a calmer side channel, where I tailed it. We were on the board within the first half-hour of the trip. Catch-and-release being highly recommended, we snapped some pictures; later, Scharf pegged the large, chrome female at 15 pounds.
Over the next couple of days, the action on the Kitimat had slowed since our epic start, as the river continued to rise and dirty from the incessant runoff. In fact, all of the glacier-fed river systems were now thoroughly blown, the Skeena so swollen it had burst its banks in parts. Lake-fed rivers and tributaries were thus the only option, as the majority of their inflow was sourced in gin-clear glacial lakes.
Luckily Scharf was back, and he had something up his sleeve.
The next day, we set out before sunrise. We tailed Scharf two hours north, deep into virgin wilderness, before abruptly turning off the highway onto a roughly hewn dirt track. This was heli-fishing country. We came in the back door—whatever scratches Menten’s truck sustained our tithe.
Within the first hour, it paid out dividends. We had three gorgeous fish landed, “farming” another 10. Initially this was a term foreign to me, but it didn’t take long to learn such lingo: “You farmed another one?” Scharf jokingly needled, as I lost fish after fish, all right off the bite. By his standards, I had amassed an entire barnyard by the day’s end.
Loathe to leave this paradise, Menten and I decided to stick around for another night before beginning the long journey back to Vancouver. Bear spray on hand, we pitched a tent under a grove of massive red cedars lining the riverbank.
Few things can compare to waking up to the soft whisper of world-class steelhead water, let alone landing yet another enormous fish (likely in the 12-pound range) within 10 minutes of dreary-eyed casting. My chipper attitude gave me away before I could start bragging, despite it being five in the morning without any coffee. Menten soon caught up, however, and our last day on the water was spent alternately taking in the powerful scenery and battling fish after chrome fish.
As we exited the river for the last time, our final catch count stood at 22 steelhead, fresh from the ocean and big (seriously, 
 … 
). Not bad for a four-day trip. Steelhead may be known as “the fish of a thousand casts,” but in Terrace, who’s counting?

=== Title: Top Restaurants Debut New Happy Hours in NYC, LA, Chicago, SF - Bloomberg ===

Way back when, the phrase "happy hour" was a guaranteed way to get my attention. Two-for-one drinks! Snacks! Party! Countless unfortunate cocktails and lame chicken wings later, and that phrase lost its power to draw me to a seat at the bar.
Or so I thought. Recently, there’s been a happy hour renaissance with several leading restaurants across the country serving a terrific array of discounted cocktails and small, and not so small, plates.
Digging down a little bit, I discovered a good reason for this. Growth in restaurant traffic has been 
 at both sit down and fast food places for a confluence reasons ranging from uncertainty over the upcoming presidential election to Brexit to Chipotle’s health department issues
 (As an added incentive to not leave your home and not exert too much effort over dinner: the ever-expanding range of delivery food services from sources like 
 and UberEats .)
But most restaurateurs are in the business of seeing a glass half full and figuring out a hospitable, and profitable, way to fill it up. Restaurants have started serving breakfast (one bright spot in that sluggish dining out study noted that breakfast sandwiches topped the growth foods list), and they’re staying open all day. And most appealing to me: They’re ramping up happy hour menus.
No less an expert than Danny Meyer, CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group, has been installing happy hour menus at his spots around Manhattan.
Take, for instance, the Italian-American trattoria 
, where chef Jason Pfeifer is serving Roman-style snacks like an enticing wedge of ricotta and roasted tomato torta and a not-as-traditionally Italian but superb fried chicken sandwich with Calabrian chile aioli, available only at the bar until 7 p.m. With a Peroni, it’s a $20 meal.
For various reasons that invariably come back to excessive drinking, happy hour is banned in eight states.  Last year, Illinois eliminated that prohibition, with a catch: Places can offer happy hour menus for no more than 15 hours per week. Now one of the cities’ most popular spots, 
, chef Paul Kahan and One Off Hospitality Group's platonic ideal of a Mex-American counter (think exceptional chicken-fried chicken and shredded dried beef breakfast tacos). Kahan is celebrating happy hour with Sip or Shoot shots of mescal or tequila for $5, plus there’s an option of a $2 beer shorty.
At one of the country’s best new restaurants in San Francisco, a city recently called out for its
, uber-sustainable 
 features 50 percent off their cocktail of the day. They also serve discounted draft beer and bar bites like pork popcorn and a corned beef hamburger.
Down in New Orleans, where happy hour seems like it’s a way of life, John Besh's bakery-restaurant 
 also recently instituted a compelling menu to bring in in more traffic in the late afternoon. Snacks like marinated crab claws and Willa Jean cornbread with Poirier's cane syrup is half price, and so are desserts. My pick would be Cookies + Milk served with a beater of raw cookie dough and a Tahitian vanilla bean milk. I’d have it with an unlikely pairing: Willa Jean’s Frosé Y’all—their addictive rose wine slushie, which screams "happy hour!" at me.
Los Angeles has even more compelling options. At the new West Coast offshoot of the New York-based, meat-centric 
, there’s a complementary charcuterie station with a spread that includes salumi, cacao e pepe chips, pork rinds—plus chicharron nachos and $5 old fashioneds on tap. It brings to mind Italy's excellent aperitivi hour except that the spread is stocked with items from the Cannibal's butcher shop. 
Cory Lane, a partner at the Cannibal, describes their happy hour mentality in a way I very much admire: “Yes, it’s driving a full room in early evening. But with the thinking, ‘Hi, we’re your new neighbors, let’s have some fun and make this a proper party every day.” 
The renovated 
’s steakhouse has expanded the whole concept of happy hour: it’s five hours long, starting at 2 p.m. (!) with $12 Champagne punch bowls for two, plus crab cake sliders and dry aged meatballs with grilled bread and spicy tomato jam.
Nick & Stef's might now offer five-hour affairs, but back in New York, Meyer’s USHG team has created a way to evolve the tradition in an even more dynamic way. At their year-old restaurant 
, their take on happy hour is Neighbors Night, which takes place Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings. From 5:30 p.m. until closing, the restaurant offers a menu designed for people in the 'hood. There’s a juicy Wagyu pastrami sandwich with mustard, as well as fried chicken with honey mustard ($13 and $12, respectively). The cocktail and wine specials highlight local products, like Not Long Island [but still alcohol spiked] Ice Tea, Long Island wines and Brooklyn beers.
“Everyone has fun with it,” says Sabato Sagaria, USHG’s Chief Restaurant Officer. “Customers don’t have to commit to a $30 entrée, and for the team it’s fun to design simpler dishes, and figure out what we can serve that’s local.” Neighborhood Nights sound so fun to me, but I don’t live in the Highline hood, where Untitled is located. That’s okay, said Sagaro. “Anyone can come. We’re not checking ids.”

=== Title: The Best Ice Cream Moments from 2016 - Bloomberg ===

During summer, it might seem as though every year is the best year for ice cream. And it's certainly been a great season for 
. But perhaps lost in the midst of the hot weather is the fact that this has been an incredible year for ice cream since winter. Here are the highlights we've seen so far and a few we have to look forward to. Because ice cream season isn't over, even if summer almost is. 
 
 The co-founder of Ben & Jerry’s, Ben Cohen, creates a flavor dedicated to presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Called

 that’s meant to “represent the majority of gains that have gone to the top 1% since the end of the recession,” according to the Bernie’s Yearning packaging.
 
. 
, a long-standing Ludington, Mich., diner, announces that it will break the world's record for the 
 ice cream dessert. Its road to success: a half-mile-long ice cream sundae. (The current world record holder was the city of Manurewa, an Auckland, New Zealand, suburb.) The dessert was forecast to include 12,700 scoops of ice cream and take up eight blocks. Spoiler alert: 
 and are waiting for their Guinness certification.
 
 After creating a frenzy on both coasts, 
 starts making legitimate inroads across the country. One of the notable spots is 
 in Atlanta. To achieve the adorable, and photogenic, rolls of ice cream, a custard base (flavors include coffee and green tea) with mix ins (from peaches to Oreos) is slathered on an icy cold negative-eight-degree plate, then scraped up into rounds and arranged in a cup. Toppings run the gamut from bananas to gummy bears.
 
 With hundreds of people lining up outside their two existing stores, the owners of New York’s

 that have have generated the gigantic following. Among the ones that dominate Instagram: The bright pink and blue, confection-studded

=== Title: Rolls-Royce Confirms Plans for Super-Luxury SUV - Bloomberg ===

Today, 
sent white-gloved chauffeurs in Phantoms around New York City to deliver letters announcing plans to build a sport utility vehicle (SUV), making good on 
 earlier this year.
Well, they’re not calling it an SUV. They’re calling it an “Everywhere Vehicle.” It even comes with its own hashtag: #EffortlessEverywhere.
The announcement comes after months of rumors that Rolls would finally introduce something to compete against Porsche’s Cayenne, Mercedes-Benz’s G-Wagon, Land Rover’s Range Rover, and Bentley’s (forthcoming) 
. This now leaves Ferrari as the only major luxury automaker without an SUV in its lineup.
Rolls has confirmed that its vehicle will be built on an all-new aluminum architecture (not one carried over from BMW’s X5 or X7 lineup), and it will be able to cross “any terrain,” according to the announcement letter. Executives have said they decided to move forward with plans to make the rig after many “discerning customers” urged them to do so.
And that, officially, is all we know.
Rolls has proffered no photo along with the letter, no sketch or rendering of what we might expect from its newest family member. Executives have also declined to divulge a timeline for when it might be built (“still a few years off,” head of communications Gerry Spahn told me on the phone today), what they might call it, or even whether it will have two or three rows of seats.
They did promise to send some images of old shooting-brake cars that Rolls used to make. You remember the ones—the big saloons wealthy people would take on hunting trips as places to store guns and wine and cucumber sandwiches as light refreshment after their jaunt. Maybe this new thing from Rolls will evoke that sprit of adventure. It certainly has the pedigree for it.
Here are a few other probabilities for Rolls’s Everywhere Vehicle:
Or so I hope.
I also expect backlash against this new model regardless of what it looks like, much like the abuse Bentley and Porsche endured when they announced their own SUVs. Luxury brand purists don’t take kindly such obvious plays for sales and market share. They couch their reticence as concern about "protecting brand heritage," but they forget that even luxury brands must stay young in spirit, sensitive to current cultural norms, and nimble enough to venture where the market leads.
SUV sales rose 88.5 percent from 2008 through 2013, according to research firm 
. By 2016 one in every five vehicles sold in the world will be an SUV. With that kind of growth, a Rolls-Royce SUV makes perfect sense—even without seeing what it’ll look like.

=== Title: Meet the Mountaineering Legend Behind Europe’s Extreme Museums - Bloomberg ===

If you’re American, you’ve probably never heard of 
, the first mountaineer to climb all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter mountain peaks (26,247 feet above sea level).
If you have, there’s a good chance you learned of him in the past few weeks, when photographs of a spaceship-like aerie designed by 
, the sixth and final outpost of the official 
, circulated the Internet. It was the final stage of a 15-year-long project by Messner to chronicle what he calls “the great history of mountaineering.”
Messner, now 71, conceived of the museums—sprinkled throughout peaks, valleys, and small towns across South Tyrol, a region in northern Italy that borders Switzerland and Austria—as a way “to tell the next generation about what happens when mountains and men meet,” he says in an interview.
It might be more instructive, however, for the next generation to know what happens when mountains and Messner met. 
 
without
Messner didn’t die, of course, and subsequently climbed Everest again by himself (again without oxygen). “Some people called it the first true ascent of Everest,” says Isserman, “because he wasn’t relying on artificial aid.”
Messner continued to climb mountains in the Himalayas and dabbled in other extreme pursuits (he trekked across Antarctica without a sled team, for instance). As he did so, he figured out how to monetize his exploits, writing “over 50” books, by his own estimation. 
The buildings of the Messner Mountain Museum each focus on different aspects of the mountain experience. There’s one devoted to hiking paraphernalia (pickaxes, journals from historical climbs, and many photographs); another is themed around mystic mountain statues. One showcases ethnological exhibits on the people of the mountains, and one—the museum concentrating on mountain rock—presents a step-by-step narrative of how the Dolomites were formed.
The real draw of the Messner Mountain Museum, though, might be its extraordinary buildings.
“One is in my castle,” Messner says, referring to 
, a mountaintop retreat dating back to the 13th century that doubles as Messner’s summer residence. Here, he says, it’s about “the holiness of mountains.”
Another, he continues, “I built myself, to be like a glacier crevasse.” 
 is unsurprisingly devoted to ice. Built into the ground, 1,900 meters above sea level, the building is low, bunker-like, and, when covered with snow, almost totally invisible. Another—the largest museum of the series—is located in the restored 
, which dates to the 10th century and sits on yet another hilltop. 
 was once the summer residence of the prince bishops (also, if you can believe it, on a hill) that goes back to the 13th century, and the last historic building is a 
 from 1912 built on a peak in the Dolomites and reclaimed by Messner in 2002. And then there’s 
, a concrete structure perched on the summit plateau of Kronplatz.
Regardless of the ownership of each building—a few are owned by municipalities and foundations, he says, and two are owned by him privately—the collection is Messner’s alone, and he doesn’t derive an income from his management of the museums. The Hadid building “is paid for by a high-class tourism company,” he says. (It told him the building cost $3 million to build, but he agrees that that number sounds very low.)
Now that the final building for his museum is complete, Messner says he’ll return to filmmaking, writing, and climbing.
“I still climb, but at a lower level,” he says. “Next week I’ll be climbing again—but only up to 5,000 meters.”
 

=== Title: 2016 BMW B6 Alpina Review: A Game Changer for the Tourer Class - Bloomberg ===

The other day, when I drove up Highway 1 on the way to Pebble Beach, I passed a 
 and a 
.
They are groundbreaking machines: precise, cold-hearted killers. Perfect on paper. I had given them 
. 
But I had a thought as I passed by: No way I’d want to be driving one. The drive to Carmel takes six hours. It's been 90 degrees during the day in Southern California, and those whips are low and tight and loud and bare. They are not designed for a day trip along the coast. 
As it happened, I was blissfully engulfed in a 2016 BMW B6 Alpina Gran Coupe. And I bring you glad tidings of comfort and joy: This is as grand a machine as its name suggests, both in driving demeanor and in its indisputably good looks.
It overtook and summarily dropped everything I saw on the road up to Carmel, and it did so with the thrilling distain of a Hapsburg prince. 
Here is what it is not: an M6.
While BMW’s M line focuses on developing aggressive personalities in its performance cars, Alpina, a separate company that started tuning BMW cars back in the 1970s, cultivates a rather more elegant demeanor for its family. The aura is similarly evident in the B7—the other Alpina developed stateside and based on the 7—as in the B6 I drove around Los Angeles and Carmel this week. Don’t drive this vehicle if you think you want a BMW M6. You’ll never make it to the M6; the Alpina will stop your search on the spot.   
The Alpina B6 Gran Coupe I drove has a 600-horsepower, twin-turbo V8 engine. It has an intelligent all-wheel drive (i.e., it reads and responds to the road in real time) on an eight-speed automatic transmission that’ll pull to 60 miles per hour in 3.6 seconds. Top speed is 200mph. Doing 100mph on an empty highway by the sea feels as easy as the wind. Or, uh, so I hear.  (The M6, by the way, has only rear-wheel drive and a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic or a six-speed manual. It also gets 560hp, 20 more than the Alpina, but has just 502 lb-ft of torque, far less than the B6. You would know the difference in an instant, if somehow you could drive them both blindfolded.)
In fact, this entire machine makes you feel as if you’ve entered 
, able to see bullets pass by in slow motion as you move through space unchallenged, unrestrained, in total control of every muscle in your body.
As a critic, my job is to nit-pick every little thing because little things add up to big impressions, but I find it impossible to find anything to complain about, driving-wise, in the B6. The brakes and steering respond as if they’re connected to electrodes in your brain—simply think a command and it’ll happen. The acceleration feels as insistent and unwavering as a bullet train. Smooth doesn’t begin to describe it. There’s simply no resistance, no lull, no apparent inertia or friction in the alternate universe you enter when you slip behind the wheel. Push the gas and feel the car embrace you—at warp speed—into another reality. 
You will know the B6 by its style. It has a certain pizazz, to use a word my mother would use, that is unusual for serious German coupes. I was not a fan of the glittery green paint job on the car I was driving—racing green should, in my opinion, be reserved for British-bred cars—but that is easily remedied as there are 18 exterior paint options.
Elsewhere, the four tail pipes, long curved roof, rear spoiler, adaptive LED headlights, and blown-out sport grill retaining those trademark kidneys leave no doubt for anyone as to what they’re dealing with. Nor does that unusual (for BMW) third brake light in the center of the roof.
The detail here is exemplary: tiny treads on the door handles for extra traction, contrast blue and green stitching on the steering wheel, alternate white leather piping on the caramel seats, Alpina custom 20-inch, 20-spoke classic rimsm and extensive “Gran Coupe” badging throughout. ALPINA is even written plainly across the front grill.  
Inside, the myrtle wood trim looks like something you’d find in a Bentley. And the seats, the seats. On my drive I kept checking myself: Was my back tired yet, annoyed, hurting? Nope. The four-way lumbar support, articulated upper backrest, and something special about the head rest placement felt like a vacation. And this was coming off a nonstop flight from JFK to LAX the previous evening. 
To that end, may I recommend some mix of Springsteen, Stones, Fetty Wap, Garbage, and Sinatra on the way up? It is silent as a tomb inside the B6. Its 16 Bang & Olufsen surround sound speakers deserve the chance to show off their worth with multiple genres of music. 
The B6 Alpina Gran Coupe costs $122,150, unless you want extras (duh!) and bespoke options on the wood and leather and stitching and rims and badges, in which case it’ll cost thousands more. Heated and ventilated rear seats, ceramic controls, and a power sunshade in the rear will cost you an additional $3,200, for instance.
It’s a fair sum. The M6 starts at $112,400; the Porsche Panamera GTS starts at $113,000; and the Mercedes S63 AMG starts at $143,000. Each of those is exceptional, though emphasizing different things—whether total luxury, power, or performance—to varying degrees of price and success. 
The Alpina, on the other hand, sits in a sweet spot among all three criteria. Isn’t it gran(d)?  

=== Title: Does Every Chef Deserve the Jiro Dreams of Sushi Treatment? - Bloomberg ===

In my favorite episode of 
, a new, six-episode series premiering on Netflix this Sunday, April 26, the famous Argentine chef Francis Mallmann guts a couple of brook trout, then washes them clean by dragging them around in a lake. 
It's just a regular day in Mallmann land. 
Then he uses soft, wet clay he's just dug from the water to seal the fish up, and places the bundle on a low fire to slowly cook in its own steam. It's an old, uncomplicated technique, but it's beautiful to watch him work. 
The best moments in this new series, each episode profiling a different chef around the world, let you quietly observe what goes on behind the scenes, equal parts food porn and character study.
This is Mallmann in his natural habitat, the vast wilderness, speaking about what he does in a characteristically poetic way. Things could easily get goofy, and sometimes they do: "When you build a fire, it's a bit like making love," Mallmann says at one point. Later he reads poetry by the dying firelight.
But David Gelb (who directed the lauded 
about Japanese sushi master Jiro Ono) has created a documentary series that explores complex stories about his subjects, without letting them get too cartoonish.
Mallmann is the romantic, wandering the hills for firewood, reading poetry by the firelight, but he's more than that, too. 
As Mallmann grills whole lambs, and hangs chickens over the coals, the episode goes into his past, to tell the story of how Mallmann, who was born in Buenos Aires but raised in Patagonia, came to reject French fine dining and "making fancy French food for rich Argentines," and went on to champion his own rustic, homegrown cooking techniques and ingredients. It didn't happen overnight. 
Chances are you're already familiar with the other chef subjects, which include Massimo Bottura of 
 in Modena, Italy; Ben Shewry of 
 in Melbourne; and Magnus Nilsson of 
 in Järpen, Sweden. Two episodes feature American chefs: Dan Barber of 
 in NYC and Niki Nakayama of 
 in Los Angeles.
I was skeptical of the series at first. Do all these chefs deserve the 
 treatment? After all, these chefs are famous—properly, internationally famous—and their stories have been told so many times, in so many glossy magazines, that I wondered if there would be any surprises. There were plenty.
 goes deeper into each chef's story and often nudges a bit at uncomfortable themes that most puff pieces tend to leave out, like Shewry's harsh financial struggles. Nakayama, who was not expected by her immediate family to succeed, talks about this only briefly, but the episode goes back to this theme of drive and perseverance in subtle, moving ways. The "mad genius" is a tired trope, but all these chefs have it in them in one way or another, and it's fascinating to watch it unfold.
So is it worth binge-watching this weekend? Yes, just make sure you have some snacks on hand, or it'll be torture.

=== Title: Roman Pizza Is the Best Dish at the New Eataly NYC Downtown - Bloomberg ===

At noon on Thursday, Aug. 11, the line outside 
 stretched a thousand people long, down three floors and out into the street.
Day One of the 45,000-square-foot, $39 million project on the third floor of 4 World Trade Center could have been more popular only if Olympic gymnast Simone Biles had somersaulted in. I arrived around 2 p.m. (partner Alex Saper estimated that I was somewhere around the 5,000th customer), grabbed a map from the woman who was handing them out fast and furiously at the entrance, and walked around.
Some 10,000 products are on offer at Eataly Downtown, the newest of 31 locations worldwide, from Chicago to Seoul to Dubai, of the Italian mega food emporium. I became focused on one: the Roman Pizza.
If you haven’t heard, the theme of this particular Eataly is bread. (It’s a unifying food, and so forth.) The team has brought in elite Italian baker Fulvio Marino—who’s also got the title of expert miller—to oversee production. Dominating the display case at the vast bakery counter are Marino’s Roman pizzas, aka 
: large, chewy rectangles of pizza dough with a multitude of colorful toppings. They’re chewy, because, unlike pizza napoletana, which is charred and crisp from baking in a super-hot wood-fired oven, Roman pizza is cooked at a lower temperature, until the bottom is crisp while the top stays doughy. (Sometimes, wacky Roman chefs even 
.)
My first piece of Roman pizza was the Tricolore, a wedge topped with a pile of prosciutto, stracciatella, arugula, and tomatoes; the green, white, and red combo brings to mind the colors of the Italian flag. My second Roman pizza was more decadent, with five cheeses that included mozzarella, gorgonzola, and fontina melting all over it. I stopped there. Among the choices awaiting me next time from the menu of 10 pizzas are summer squash with dollops of ricotta and sweet Italian sausage with slices of sautéed peppers. The most expensive one costs $7.90 for a generous slice. (Unlike in Rome, you don't order these pizzas by the centimeter.)
It turns out that I’m not the only one ordering Roman Pizza.
It’s one of the new location's breakout items, where customers are going through about 1,800 slices a day. (The straight up Margherita is the most popular.) Anything with the word "pizza" in it is going to sell well at Eataly. But unlike the Neapolitan pies on the other side of the store, which require a wait, the Roman pizzas are ready for instant consumption. And that’s one of the things that Eataly Downtown is banking on.
If Eataly’s flagship in Manhattan’s Flatiron gained fame as one of the city’s top tourist destinations, the downtown location is attuned to feeding the Financial District crowd, which wants fast service. The place is implementing several clever methods to do that.
In the coming months, Eataly will introduce an app so the hyper-busy downtown business crew, which isn't sticking around to watch the mozzarella-making and pasta-shaping mini demos, can dash in to pick up preordered panini, the counter for which is purposefully located right near the entrance. Also close to the entrance are the Juice Bar, the Espresso counter (which doubles as a wine bar), and the Bakery. Deeper in the store are areas dedicated to ingredients that invite lingering, such as pasta, meat, and cheese, along with five full-service restaurants.
Eataly is also emphasizing breakfast as a meal for the downtown neighborhood that gets an early start: The store opens at 7 a.m. and has introduced a series of breakfast panini such as the Parma, which is stuffed with two eggs, prosciutto, and fontina. Judging from the lines so far, it's another winning innovation. 
, 
, a former senior adviser to Italy's prime minister, Matteo Renzi, and Eataly’s executive president, characterized Eataly's strategy as particularly North America-focused, with stores in the works for Boston, Los Angeles, and Toronto out of 10 additional locations on the drawing board. There's also a 
 dubbed Eataly World under-construction outside Bologna, Italy.  
“The U.S. currently accounts for 25 percent of sales. The U.S. and Italy together will represent 75 percent of revenues by the end of the next year,” he said. “This year, we close with something above €400 million ($451 million) [of revenues].” 
Eataly will go public on the Milan stock exchange as early as the end of 2017, according to founder Oscar Farinetti. No word yet on when it might list in the U.S., but Bloomberg Intelligence’s Michael Halen told me that sales figures indicate there could be viable interest. “It’s unique, which investors like,” he said.

=== Title: Local Uber Services—From UberLux to UberPet—Offer Global Appeal - Bloomberg ===

Have you ever heard of UberWine or UberSki? Didn’t think so.
Those services, like countless of other Uber add-ons, are destination-specific perks, created to suit local lifestyles and address common requests. In California, that means having a driver stick with you for a day of wine tastings, while in Utah, it's about getting to the slopes—with your gear in tow.
“Our focus is on local markets everywhere we are,” said Amy Friedlander, head of business development and experiential marketing at 
, during an interview with Bloomberg. One of the company’s “north stars,” she said, is celebrating the uniqueness of the cities they operate in—all 400 and counting.
Sometimes this materializes as a brief pop-up program, such as the helicopter-centric 
offering that has run in such places as the Hamptons and Cannes during busy summer and festival seasons, shuttling VIPs to and from tony events. Other times it’s even quicker, such as a one-day event delivering kittens to corporate buildings for a brief stress-relief session. After that promotion ran, said Friedlander, the company would have needed “hundreds of thousands of kittens" to meet the demand that came up in response, "which was off the charts.”
But the most useful Uber extensions aren’t short-term at all. “We want to explore what’s meaningful about a city and how we can contribute to how transportation works there,” Friendlander said. She was talking about such programs as 
, which lets Amsterdam bikers mount their bicycles onto a car if they’d rather not pedal home, or 
, a recurring pop-up service that lets entrepreneurs book a ride with venture capitalists and private equity investors in business capitals from Boston to Berlin. 
Usually special offerings are promoted only to locals—with the help of e-mail marketing campaigns that the company prefers to use as sparingly as possible. But for a company such as Uber, creating a hyper-local service is no small feat. It has to be offered instantly at scale, which means that city-specific general managers for the company have to work in tandem with the most willing-to-experiment drivers to ensure that there are enough cars—equipped with bike racks or pet-friendly seat covers—to meet demand right away.
The best way to find out about specialized services in the cities you’re visiting is simply to browse through the app, says Friendlander. But instead of leaving you guessing about what you’ll find where, we’ve rounded up the coolest, quirkiest, and most useful offerings that are regularly on offer around the globe.
 
 New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.
This kid-friendly program happens to be one of the company’s more complicated value adds. The pricing is simple: A $10 surcharge on Uber X rides will get you one with a carseat for your child. But you’ll have to check 
 to make sure your child is the right age and weight for the forward-facing seats that Uber is using. For Uber, pulling off the effort required special training to make sure the car seats were being installed safely—and the oversight of the advocacy group Car Seat Lady. The program is catching on internationally, too—a similar initiative called UberFamily made its debut in Istanbul this March.
 
 San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara, Calif.; Valle de Guadalupe, Mexico
Forget about choosing a designated driver—or overpaying for a chauffeur—to take you from vineyard to vineyard. At least in some destinations, Uber has you covered for an entire day of tastings. The pilot for UberWine was launched last year in the central coast California regions of SLO and Santa Barbara, both emerging as veritable forces in their own right. (Though you can hire drivers for the day, you still pay $1.25 per mile or 29¢ per minute.)
The service is also available in Mexico’s burgeoning 
, where UberValle drivers pick you up at the U.S. border and take you to the best wineries for a quick and easy day trip. Napa and Sonoma, however, have yet to roll out the program.
 
 New Delhi, Hanoi, Bangalore, Ho Chi Minh City, and more
Motorcycle tours in these Asian capitals are coveted experiences—on such activity-booking sites as 
, you can pay upward of $75 for a half-day outing. Hack it by booking an UberMoto, which works just like any other Uber vehicle. (It was introduced in multiple cities this past February.) You’ll be provided with the make and model of your driver’s motorcycle so you can easily find one another. And yes, helmets are included where required by law.
 
 Rome, London, and Los Angeles
Don’t settle for a ride in a Hyundai. In style capitals around the globe, Uber allows riders to book top-tier vehicles—each one inspected to meet certain standards. The basic rules: The car must be among a set of approved makes and models (e.g. Mercedes Benz S or G Class, Porsche Panamera, any Bentley or 
), can’t be more than four years old, and must have a black interior and exterior. Lux drivers are encouraged to dress professionally (“wearing a suit is highly recommended,” says the driver tip sheet), provide bottled water, and be able to offer restaurant recommendations. As a rider in Los Angeles, where the pricing is most transparent, you’ll pay a base of $20 for the privilege and four times the local per-minute price.
 
 Lake Tahoe, Park City, Utah, and Santiago, Chile
There are just two things you want if you’re hailing an Uber in a ski town: a rack for your gear and all-wheel drive. You’ll get both with UberSki, and you’ll have to pay only about $5 extra for the convenience.
 
 Amsterdam and São Paulo
In cities such as these, Uber faces competition not just from taxis, but also from the popularity of commuting by bike. Here, catering to bikers isn’t just a useful offering—it’s a smart business move. So Uber allows drivers to hitch bike racks to their vehicles and offer bike-and-passenger pickups as part of UberBike. It’s been available in São Paulo for a year and costs an additional 4 Brazilian reais; the service was introduced in Amsterdam this June and costs an extra €4 in addition to the regular fare.
 
 Mexico City
Who knew that Mexico City was a haven for 
? Official this June, you can now travel with your dogs, cats, birds, and fish without worrying about potential cleaning fees. There are small minimum tariffs: 70 Mexican pesos (less than $4) for a regular car and roughly $8 for an Uber Black car. Service dogs, however, are exempt from the upcharge.
 
 Istanbul
UberBoat has popped up in Miami for Art Basel and in Baltimore for Light City—two annual festivals that drive thousands of travelers. But in Istanbul, UberBoat is a full-time offering. You can zip between Europe and Asia in a small, 6- to 8-person yacht—or you can use the service to get to the airport or the nearby Princess Islands for a quintessential day trip. (See 
 for pricing.)
 
 Paris, Porto, and Lisbon
The city that hosted the 2015 United Nations 
 was also the first to offer UberGreen, which puts a spotlight on electric and hybrid cars, such as the Nissan Leaf and Toyota Prius. There’s no surcharge for passengers; a Green ride costs the same as an UberX trip if all other parameters remain unchanged. In Portugal, UberGreen is still in pilot mode; it was launched in March with just 20 cars in Porto and Lisbon combined.

=== Title: Rock Star Chef Ferran Adrià Says Chefs Should Not Be Rock Stars - Bloomberg ===

It’s no longer possible to eat the food of 
, one of the most groundbreaking chefs in history. But very soon you can experience amazing insights into his transformative work from 
 and beyond, at least if you can get to the 
 in St. Petersburg, Fla.
For 
, the chef will showcase his culinary work from tabletop pieces and flatware he’s designed to detailed notebooks he’s kept throughout his cooking career. They’ll appear alongside the intense, food-focused paintings and flatware designed by Salvador Dalí. The Gulf Coast museum, a modern building with fantastical glass structures and stairways, is home to some 2,000 pieces, the largest collection of the surrealist artist’s work outside Europe. (Adrià and Dalí have more in common than both being brilliant game-changers in their respective arts; Adrià's legendary restaurant, elBulli, is situated near where Dalí lived on Spain's Costa Brava.)
This is his latest, and last, museum exhibition before he opens an eagerly awaited culinary center called 
 in Roses, Spain, which will exist on the site of his former restaurant. The number 1846 represents the number of dishes Adrià estimates that he created there. The opening is slated for mid-2018. 
Over e-mail, Adrià reveals why he wishes he lived at the same time as Dalí; which chefs he admires most right now; and whether the world’s obsession with cooks has gone too far.
All are interesting to me. It’s a very sentimental show. If I had to pick one, it would be this one image: my dish of bone marrow with caviar juxtaposed against tiles designed by Dalí. [In his book 
, Adrià highlights this dish as a turning point in elBulli’s evolution, local ingredients from the sea and mountains in an unexpected combination. “Filling in a blank in haute cuisine!” is how Adria describes it in the book.]
Not really. The interesting thing, the major link it will examine is our closeness in geography and spirit, and, of course, our affinity for science and art [which was also Dalí’s intrinsic paradigm].
Of course I’m an admirer of Salvador Dalí. He is one of the greats of the 20th century. I’ve always been interested in his peculiar way of thinking. As for my favorite artists: Picasso, Miro, Duchamp, and Richard Hamilton.
I’m fascinated by all the pieces that appear in his book 
. The truth is, I would have loved to have met him. Our style in elBulli is very much minimalist, but surely, if we had lived in his epoch of surrealism, we’d have been influenced to some extent.
But the truth is no, Dalí did not inspire any of our dishes. Apart from a pair of pointed exceptions—Gaudí and Tàpies—works of art were never a direct inspiration for us at elBulli.
Now, back to the idea of creativity in elBulli 1846, it’s important to clear up things up: A work of art should be the last place we go to when we talk about what inspires creativity. It’s much more useful to try to understand the disruptive thinking of the great artists rather than use their creations as inspirations for a dish.
It’s a very interesting subject for me, and one [that] hasn’t gotten enough attention. At elBulliLab [his Barcelona research facility], we are trying to figure out why there has been no equivalent to avant-garde art in the world of gastronomy.
Really, I think there are many, certainly everyone who came to cook on elBulli’s last day, July 30, 2011: 
 of Noma; 
 of Mugaritz; 
 of Osteria Francescana. But if I were to single out someone in the U.S., I would say 
 and 
, who also cooked on that last day and who contributed so much to elBulli.
The problem nowadays is that there’s so much quality that it’s difficult to find something extraordinary. I have a lot of fantastic eating experiences. But, the truth is that in the last few years, I’ve had a hard time trying to see what stands out dramatically. Perhaps it’s Japan that continues to inspire me.
The world is obsessed with too many things. In terms of food, we have to remember that we eat three times a day, that we dedicate more than half our free time to feeding ourselves. Cooks and chefs are the top of a huge and broad pyramid that includes the food industry, tourism, health. … There are many important elements here. In this sense, I think it’s good that chefs have such a big impact on society.
Then there’s another thing: Cooking as part of the entertainment industry. The chef as a rock star? It’s as illogical as cooks being sports stars or actors, etc. In an ideal world, it would be much more relevant to be a scientist or someone who makes tangible contributions to society. But that’s the way the world works.

=== Title: How to Plan a Tour de France Trip - Bloomberg ===

When Andy Levine, the chief executive officer and founder of 
, talks about the Tour de France, he fires up with as much wattage as Nairo Quintana on a steep climb.
“Following the Tour is like following a circus and maybe following the Grateful Dead,” he says. His energy builds with each phrase. “It’s all sorts of wild and crazy. You’re following this exciting party that stretches 200 kilometers each day. It’s like Burning Man!”
That’s why every year, he and his company immerse guests in the middle of it all. He gets them into VIP areas, where they can watch the athletes getting ready for a new leg, training with their coaches, and setting up their bikes; he secures prime seats in the bleachers near the Arc de Triomphe, where the race comes to its momentous close; and he takes guests biking ahead of the competitive pack on several legs, for an immersive experience that can’t be rivaled. He’s also friends with many of the athletes, so insider access is a given.  
There’s space for only 14 guests on each of three DuVine trips: one that goes from the Alps to Paris; another focuses on the mountain stages and legendary climbing routes in the Pyrenees; and a third goes soft on cycling and hard on wine tastings in Burgundy, a new destination for the Tour. Unlike similar trips, DuVine takes guests biking in front of the Tour on select legs, rather than following behind the entire thing. 
Demand is running high this year, so enthusiasts will want to book now. “Cycling is getting more and more popular. and the Tour is becoming a bucket list thing again,” says Levine, who added that it’s no coincidence that LVMH is now 
 the high-end bike manufacturer, Pinarello.
Another reason demand is high? Few outfitters offer trips alongside the Tour to begin with. A list of official operators can be found 
; not all of them focus on end-to-end services by which travelers can expect to have top-notch accommodations and guiding. (The list isn’t comprehensive; it reflects only operators that pay to have the direct affiliation.)
, the most esteemed company among the Tour’s “approved agents,” says its Tour de France Alps trip has already sold out. But other itineraries—such as a Pyrenees-focused trip and another that focuses on the Paris finish line experience—still have availability. 
, which once offered Tour de France trips, has stopped offering them because of logistical concerns, like high cancelation costs and limited hotel stock.
In other words, book a remaining spot on one of these top-notch trips while they last. There aren’t many of them, and they’re going fast.
But don’t book your airfare until later. According to online travel agency 
, which specializes in aviation-data insights and airfare predictions, flights to Paris in July won’t vary substantially in price until 48 days before departure. But since summer is a busy season for travel to France, expect to pay a premium for tickets; Hopper has identified a “good deal price” as being roughly $915, if you’re leaving from U.S. East Coast airports (New York’s JFK, Washington’s Dulles, Boston's Logan) and $1175 if you’re leaving from San Francisco or Los Angeles.
As for how to choose among the different types of trips? The Alps and Paris trip is the most popular—partly because of the climactic finale, which allows guests to spend time in the City of Light, and partly because it’s the itinerary that spends the most time alongside the Tour itself. (It coincides with a full four legs of the race.) Trek Travel’s equivalent trip is also that company’s first to sell out.
For diehard cyclists, a mountain stages trip is the next-best option; the physical demands will be challenging, and you’ll feel satisfied tackling some of the world’s most iconic climbs. And if you’re not looking to sweat for a week straight, focus on Paris (or Burgundy), where you’re guaranteed a more esoteric trip with 
 and amazing food and wine. Either way, you’ll join the diehard cheering squads for at least one leg.  
“At the finish line for famous legs, there will be close to 100,000 people cheering, ‘allez, allez, allez!’” says Levine about the festive spirit of the Tour. “Watching on your couch is amazing, but being there live? That’s the whole deal.”

=== Title: World's Best Restaurant Winner Noma to Shut - and Reopen on an Urban Farm - Bloomberg ===

Chef Rene Redzepi plans to close 
, which has won the 
 title four times, and later reopen it on an urban farm nearby in Copenhagen, 
.
The final service at the current waterside location will be at the end of 2016. Noma will relocate at an unspecified date in 2017 to the Christiania neighborhood, the newspaper said, citing Redzepi, who said he plans to abandon traditional tasting menus.
Instead of progressing through starters, fish and meat to dessert, diners will be served a set of related dishes reflecting the season. In the spring and summer, Noma will be vegetarian. In in the autumn, it will focus on wild game.
 The restaurant will be situated in the middle of an urban farm that will supply the vegetables for the restaurant, Redzepi told the paper. Before that, Noma will temporarily 
for an Australian residency for 10 weeks from January 2016.
Noma won the World's Best restaurant title from 2010 through 12 and again in 2014. This year, it dropped to third, behind El Celler de Can Roca (Girona, Spain) and Osteria Francescana (Modena Italy).
Redzepi and Noma's managing director, Peter Kreiner, didn't immediately return calls seeking comment.

=== Title: Review: Noma Chef's New Venture, Restaurant 108 Dining in Copenhagen - Bloomberg ===

You might wait months for a table at 
, the four-time winner of the 
 award, and pay 1,900 kroner ($285) for a 
 featuring dishes such as moss cooked in chocolate.
Or, as of last week, you have the option of popping into 
 next door in Copenhagen, where Noma alumnus Kristian Baumann is serving accessible dishes starting below 100 kroner. (His business partner, Rene Redzepi of Noma, doesn’t cook at 108.)
And the great thing is that 108 doesn’t feel second-best. In fact, the buzzy dining room is more fun than at Noma, where the friendliness of the staff never entirely dispels the sense you are in a gastronomic temple that pushes culinary boundaries as insistently as a drug dealer with crack.
Don’t get me wrong: I love Noma, which is worth the money and worth the wait. But you can have a great evening at 108, with fabulous, adventurous food and unusual wines to match.
The menu at 108 is short and appears simple: There were seven mains—with options such as cured mackerel and braised oxtail—and three desserts when I visited on July 30, two days after the official opening. But don’t be deceived: Considerable work has gone into each dish and Baumann, 29, is a chef to watch.
He cooks with the sensibility he developed at Noma, spending time foraging in the countryside before returning to the kitchen to do the fermenting, pickling and smoking that is at the heart of the cuisine. But he is also in touch with his Korean roots.
He was born in Seoul, then adopted when he was 4 months old by Danish parents who raised him in the village of Ganløse, outside Copenhagen, while being sure to expose him to Korean culture.
“They used to take me to all these different gatherings, and they showed me the culture, and they showed us rice, 
 and 
 and all these different things,” he says. “But we went to my grandmother’s on Sundays, and we had pork roast, boiled potatoes and gravy.”
, with a stripped-down look that might owe something to the time Baumann spent in Japan with Noma. But this is not simple food. Take the cured mackerel (125 kroner) for example.
The Danish fish is filleted and covered in pine salt for an hour before being washed in homemade celery vinegar. It is sliced and topped with salted gooseberries from last year and a little bit of seaweed, then served with an oil made from foraged spruce wood. This dish is salty and sweet, with a touch of acidity and layers of flavor that unfold on your tongue. 
And then there is the braised oxtail (100 kroner) which looks like a donut and is a cross between 
a Danish pastry served with jam at Christmas, and
a Japanese snack. The oxtails are braised and then seasoned with shallots, coriander and lemon thyme. They are glazed with barley (fermented at Noma) and topped with pine needles. You start lightly crunching into them, tasting the forest and sweetness, and then get knocked back with a big umami hit of the savory meat.
Other dishes include raw lamb with last year’s pickles—a Nordic steak tartare—and caramelized milk skin, a pancake that you wrap around grilled pork belly and a salad of cress and wasabina, a mustard-flavored Asian leaf.
The desserts are equally inventive, including a cone made from leftover sourdough that is filled with toasted barley ice cream, along with an oil made out of the barley, plus blackcurrants and topped with hazelnuts.
The service is informal yet attentive, and you could have a very good time without even getting stuck into the wines, which range in price from 300 kroner to 850 kroner a bottle.
The idea of 108 is that people should be able to wander in and just have a dish or two. Walk-ins are welcome and reservations aren’t taken months in advance. But my guess is that this neighborhood restaurant may become an international destination.
Better get there fast.

=== Title: The Audi A6 TDI Is Everything a Diesel Driver Should Be - Bloomberg ===

I recently spent a solitary afternoon driving in SoHo.
No destination, really, just a few errands and a pillow of time between engagements.
The heat index that day informed me it felt like 100F outside. The inside of the car, a 2016 Audi A6 TDI, felt as cool as a cave.
The afternoon sun glistened on my hood as I rolled past Sant Ambroeus and Café Select, each lined with tables positioned out front like pawns across a chessboard. They sat in prime placement for SoHo-regular Europeans and models to enjoy the scene, and to be seen.
The A6 felt like a delicious respite. I was viewing it through rose-tinted shades, surely: My most recent rides had included 
 and a Ferrari and 
. All were fun, of course, in their own way, but not quite civilized. Not quite relaxing, either physically or emotionally.
The Audi A6 is.
This is the $59,500 diesel version of the $46,200 A6 sedan. Yes, it’s important to note that it’s powered by a 240-horsepower diesel V6 engine, but I hope you quickly forget that detail. It should be a footnote to legitimately notable specifications such as 38 mpg on the highway and more torque than half the crossovers offered these days with an “off-road” option. Those items are direct results of diesel technology, but they should come as no surprise. They deserve to stand on their own merit, not as addenda to a diesel asterisk.
Anyway, the only way you’ll know this car runs on diesel is from the TDI label along the back. Most regard it as a badge of pride. It’s a talisman for those individuals aware—and lucky—enough to be in the club that owns one. (Diesels typically have the shortest turnaround times on dealer lots of any Audi models.)
Otherwise, the A6 looks like every other Audi sedan on the market: the handsome, bold wide ladder-style front grille framed by brilliant LED headlights and an enlarged quad ring logo. If the sides and back remain a little plain—as is the Audi way—they still look leaner through the gills than the shorter-nosed A4 and rounded A8.
I recommend the $1,800 “S Line Sport Package” for its sportier front and rear bumpers and 19-inch, five-spoke wheels; that’ll give it a more distinct feel. Spend the extra to $1,400 to get those LED headlamps. It won’t seem like an Audi without them.
As you might expect, the A6 forms a neat bridge between the relatively compact A4 and the spacious A7 hatchback. The front seats are plenty wide, with dashboard buttons and fine-grain wooden panel inserts wrapping around them like the bow of a boat. The (standard) slim sunroof is less than panoramic, smaller than what you might find in something from, say, Jaguar, but at least it’s there.
I liked the firm, thick leather seats (black comes standard, as does the heating function). I liked the ease of the Bluetooth and the navigation, as well as the heating/cooling systems. It’s all centered together in the middle console rather than spread out across the steering wheel, center, sides, and top of the dash like some other, more expensive cars. In the back, though, watch your knees. The A6 is best configured for our friends below 6 feet.
Manual side and rear window shades back there cost more but help keep everything cool (see: cavelike) and private. I’d also buy the $850 Bose Surround Sound System and $2,550 Driver Assistance Package, which includes top and corner cameras, lane assist, adaptive cruise control, and a distance sensor that will make it virtually impossible to crash the thing. (The A6 was an IIHS Top Safety Pick last year.)
If it sounds like this car needs a lot of the options to make it really livable, that’s because it does: The sub-60K price tag is admirable, and a basic parking system, for instance, comes standard, but I have a hard time imagining any you’ll keep your own car to that amount once you start realizing which add-ons you’ll want for comfortable living.
What I’d choose if I really had my way are firmer brakes and a little more urgency at the steering wheel. If you like vice-grip engineering and a stiff little body, stick with BMW’s $57,100 5 Series diesel. Now that’s a car for driving. And I don’t think I’m just parroting the “Ultimate Driving Machine” tagline by saying so.
(Mercedes-Benz’s $52,650 E250 BlueTEC has less horsepower and fewer cylinders than both and is significantly more lethargic off the line. And its slightly better gas mileage probably isn’t enough to offset its dangerously-close-to-outdated look. But that’s a topic for another column.)
But here is where you split hairs, because while the 5 Series is better around corners and when braking, the A6 beats it off the line (zero to 60 in 5.5 seconds, vs. 5.8 for the BMW 535d), even though it’s heavier and has less horsepower. It just feels lighter to drive. 
The A6 comes with eight-speed, paddle-shifting automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Operating it is kind of a nonissue; it runs seamlessly from gear to gear, with no offensive pauses, noises, or bursts. All is civilized but not stuffy, efficient but not sparse.
When I’m in the mood for an afternoon daydream
that’s exactly what I want. I’ll choose the A6 TDI every time.

=== Title: Essay: Searching for Jim Harrison and the Montana of Legends of the Fall - Bloomberg ===

In 2008, I had just begun inching toward a writing career when, after a year in graduate school, I quit to go work for a well-paying online startup in New York. In just months, I was let go. I was six months shy of 30.
My then-girlfriend greeted this sudden windfall of free time with an ultimatum: “Either you go—or I do.” She meant Montana, about which she’d endured years of moaning. Fifteen years before, as an unsettled immigrant kid in suburban New Jersey, I’d been mesmerized by Jim Harrison’s novella 
. Set in the early 20th century in central Montana, it tells the story of wild Tristan Ludlow and how he doomed the people he loved. I wanted to write like Harrison, be like Tristan Ludlow, and live in a place like that. This fantasy didn’t square with a Russian family’s plans for its only child, so it stayed unrequited.
“While you’re out there,” my girlfriend went on, “you should find Jim.” I laughed—I was going to show up on the man’s doorstep and ask what I should do with my life? I didn’t even know where he lived. She shrugged in that way that always seemed to me so enviably American: You’ll figure it out. I set off on a crisp September morning with no plan for the first time in my life. I’d never driven west of New Jersey.
The road rewards the prepared but reserves a soft spot for the utterly not. In Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, where many of Harrison’s other novels are set, I came across people who knew how to reach him. By the time I entered Wisconsin and cell service, I had two messages:
A solo journey, for all its mystique, is also relentless and lonely, and my periodic phone conversations with Jim helped shorten the way west. He told me about a pair of Russian legs he knew once and also about an Italian sandwich shop in Butte, Mont., that I’d be foolish to miss. I reached him in Livingston, an hour north of Yellowstone National Park. The sky was malignantly violet with an oncoming storm, and lemon-colored aspens studded the fir-covered mountainside like gold fillings.
It’s one of those towns that people hesitate to tell you about, because its kind of magic feels endangered. That it’s in some of America’s most spellbinding country—the Gallatin and Absaroka ranges to the south, the Crazy Mountains to the north—is only part of the reason. There’s second-home money here but also many working-class people, and the two tiers mingle not only on the street, as the rich and regular do in New York, but socially, too. Someone once told me that Livingston has the same number of churches as bars.
One of my mornings there, I ate next to a house painter who said he was reading the great Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. In this part of Montana, you meet people who don’t fit into the categories you bring from New York—conservationist hunters, liberals opposed to big government, manual laborers who can quote 
. Harrison’s fiction is full of men who know who Modigliani is but also how to cut someone’s throat; now I understood where he got them.
I found Jim at the bar of the Murray Hotel, where Sam Peckinpah once shot up the ceiling when he was having trouble with a screenplay. I was so nervous that I hugged the great bulk of him. Vodka to vodka, we made plans for a dinner at his home the following day.
It took me 45 minutes to drive the 9 miles from the Murray to Jim’s house, though the speed limit is 70. I kept having to pull over, because I’d never been in that kind of cathedral. Jim’s wife, Linda, prepared a pot roast with carrots, potatoes, and onions from her garden, while Jim drove me around with a cigarette and a tumbler of red wine bouncing on the armrest between us. We idled to look at a ridge of hard, ochre peaks and talked about writing, women, and the surreal splendor around us.
At dinner, Jim ladled the gravy off the pot roast with such vigor that every swishing spoonful contributed some to his shirt. I watched the clock move toward my departure time and finally blurted out the question that had vexed me for years: “Why do we forgive Tristan Ludlow?” Jim thought about it. “Tristan is ungovernable,” he said. “He could be no one else. Just as I couldn’t have been anything other than a writer.” As I walked out, Jim took me by the shoulders and recited some lines from a poem by Louis Simpson. “Be true / to your own strange kind.”
I go back to western Montana almost every year. Usually, I find a new place I don’t want to tell people about. Cooke City, which has no stoplights, cell service, or law enforcement, but locavore values that put New York to shame. (Its residents build kitchen cabinets from their walnut trees and drink beer from keg systems at home because the nearest recycling is three hours away.) Polebridge, which has all of one saloon and one general store—neither possible to patronize without making a friend—but also the least-traveled part of Glacier National Park in its backyard. Flathead Lake, almost the length of two marathons and as clear as a glass of mountain water, where you never need more than two hands to count the bodies on its pebbly beaches.
Each time, I think back to that first visit. In a place so uninhabited, I was able to imagine being more needed than in New York, the capital of disposable writers. I felt elevated, rather than diminished, by the mountains. America has mostly dispensed with its myths about the West, but as a recent immigrant, I responded to it in the 19th century way, as a land to start again, where I found the confidence to return to my calling. “For West is where we all plan to go some day,” Robert Penn Warren writes in 
. “It is where you go to grow up with the country.”

=== Title: You Can Now Hire a Hollywood Filmmaker to Shoot Your Next Vacation - Bloomberg ===

Filmmaker 
 has worked on the set of countless big-budget blockbusters—
, 
, 
—but now he’s setting his sights on more personal projects. He has signed on as the exclusive drone photographer for bespoke travel outfitter 
, a job that will have him crisscrossing the globe filming travelers from the skies.
Among the things he might capture while heading up Black Tomato's just-launched "Drone the World" initiative: travelers on motorcycle tours of Ho Chi Minh City, sand boarding down the dunes of Namibia’s Skeleton Coast, hiking along the Great Wall of China, or scaling a volcano in Iceland. Unlike major metropolitan areas, these iconic destinations are among the places where drones are allowed to film freely. (Couples looking for footage of their honeymoon in New York, however, would be out of luck.)
"We find that working with Tim, and other drone cameramen, really adds an extra dimension to clients' travel experiences," Tom Marchant, co-founder of Black Tomato, told Bloomberg. Photographers and drone cameramen are a natural extension of his company's already deep commitment to partnering travelers with expert guides and academics. According to Marchant, it's a win-win situation: The cameramen get to broaden their portfolio of work and travel to new places while they're in between big budget films, while travelers get a souvenir that's hard to top. 
What it will cost you? At least $5,500—that’s the starting price per person for a weekend trip that includes Browning as a tag-along guest. More moderately priced options can be arranged, too; Black Tomato has a network of local affiliate photographers that can create videos at a variety of different price points. Destinations, length of trip, and photographer credentials all affect the bottom line. 
Travel videos are hardly a new concept, as anyone with grainy, bumpy footage of his or her parents begging them to smile can attest. Drone videos, on the other hand, started to take off late last year, when ski resorts began one-upping the de rigeur GoPro video with offers to shoot killer runs from the sky.
Leading the pack was 
, a startup with backing from Google X whose safety-oriented policies earned it a rare exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration. Since the 2015-16 ski season, it has operated at such U.S. mountains as Squaw Valley in Lake Tahoe, Calif., and Winter Park in Colorado. For $200 or less, the company will shoot a minute-and-a-half clip of you skiing or mountain biking. The drones can keep up with speeds of up to 40 miles per hour and hover only above trails that are clearly indicated as drone-friendly areas.
But having a fully-fledged feature film producer shoot your travels takes the trend to another level.
Black Tomato isn’t alone in offering the service. During a recent interview at Bloomberg’s New York offices, 
, co-founder of UrLife, said that he stepped away from a successful career in moviemaking to spend more time with his kids. But after two decades of producing films with Adam Sandler at Happy Madison Productions, he couldn’t help turn footage from his mundane weekend getaways into fabulous family flicks. It wasn’t long before he was getting requests from family and friends; 
 was officially born in May 2015.
 
Now he and a team of film editors collect clips that clients shoot on their phones and turn them into 
or movie trailers. Pricing varies depending on length (they start at $295 for a one-minute clip and go up to $995 for five-minutes), and footage is turned around in just one week.
The company is pursuing white-label agreements with hotels, starting with the 
 in San Diego, where guests who stay in the premium villas get free video editing services built into their room rate. A similar agreement is soon to be launched at the 
 on the Big Island of Hawaii.
For those who would rather have a photo album, rather than a video clip, there’s a similar service for still images.
 will dispatch one of its photographers to document your travels—either as a planned photo shoot or in “stealth mode.” Run by Nicole Smith, a British Columbia marketing executive who was tired of taking selfies on vacation, Flytographer’s services are meant to be booked in half-hour to half-day intervals, with prices starting at $250. Since its launching in 2013, it has expanded to cover travelers in 180 cities around the globe. Its biggest demographic, naturally, is the man who’s planning to propose—the company has gotten so many of these requests, it even launched a Proposal Concierge service to help plan, execute, and capture that perfect surprise.

=== Title: Mead: It's Not Just for Hobbits Anymore - Bloomberg ===

In his recent three-star review of 
—the Nordic-inspired restaurant in Manhattan’s Grand Central Terminal, from 
—
 restaurant critic Pete Wells 
 mead as an oddball beverage.
“Strange things are happening in mead,” Wells wrote about the wine list, which includes an entire section of mead, “a beverage that is pretty strange to begin with.”
It’s true: For most Americans, mead is an unfamiliar beverage that’s commonly perceived as sweet and alcoholic and is often equated with 
 and Renaissance Faire enthusiasts. But it’s also part of an historic winemaking tradition, one that has been utilized the world over for millennia as a way of making a fermented beverage.
According to the American Mead Makers Association, mead is one of the fastest-growing alcoholic beverages in the country by sheer number of new producers. In 2003, the U.S. had roughly 30 producers. Today, there are more than 300, with meaderies opening in parts of the country as far flung as 
.; 
a.; 
; and even 
.
However, commercially available meads are still relatively rare, and the beverage hasn’t been fully embraced en masse. There’s no widely sold “six-pack” mead, for instance, the way that there is for beer and even cider. The new breed of meads are experimental and funky, infused with fruits and herbs that add tannins and bitterness to balance the honey’s sweetness. 
“There’s pressure on the industry to think about mead the same way we think about grape wine,” said Raphael Lyon, a mazer, or meadmaker, based in New York. “They want you to have two or three different meads based on two or three different kinds of honey—‘varietal’ meads,” he says.
But to Lyon, who makes mead under the 
 moniker, honey may be the least important factor.
“People make the mistake of thinking about mead as a wine that’s made from honey and water,” he said. “If you start in the other direction, you’ll see that mead is a way of taking fruits and herbs and adding honey to them and fermenting it all together. The idea of just honey-plus-water doesn’t have any kind of historic authenticity.”
Lyon started Enlightenment Wines in 2009 out of a barn in the Hudson Valley. This summer, he expanded to a small production facility in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and opened an on-site tasting room and cocktail bar called 
. There, mixologist Arley Marks serves Lyon’s bone-dry honey wines, along with several cocktails that feature mead, such as Night Eyes, made with sparkling mead, apples, and cranberries.
A hyper-educated, creative guy with art degrees from both Brown and Columbia, Lyon began making mead in the 1990s as a way of distancing himself from what he calls “the networks of commerce that fuel modern food systems.”
(If that sounds a little out of the mainstream for a commercial beverage producer, it is; mead seems to attract freethinkers and outsiders, as bees are drawn to, uh, honey.)
“I was really interested in, ‘What are the basics of survival?’” he explained. “Not from an apocalyptic sense but just to know what a self-sufficient farm looked like, what heirloom crops were.”
He takes a philosophical approach to making honey wine and sees himself as part of an historical winemaking tradition. He insists on using unprocessed honey, which is richer in nutrients, to make the yeast happy.
“The role of the mazer is about seeing the natural world,” he said, “finding the elements of it that you want to preserve, and using honey as the sugar basis for the fermentation process.”
Lyon said that thinking about mead the way we think about modern grape wine culture is historically fraught because “most alcohol for millennia was made from a bunch of different stuff.” For Lyon, that stuff includes such things as foraged dandelion flowers, wild apples, elderberries, juniper berries, lavender, marjoram, cranberries, tart cherries, rose hips, and sumac flowers, all of which find their way into the mead he makes.
“Mead made from just honey and water doesn’t have any tannin or structure,” said Lyon. “Using herbs and botanicals doesn’t just provide a flavor, it’s critical for the fermentation process. It clears the wine and it prevents microbial spoilage.” (The yeast and proteins are attracted to the botanicals and then fall out to the bottom of the fermenter with time.)
Despite its status as an outsider drink, mead is very much a global beverage.
In Africa, where mead is called Tej, it’s brewed with gesho, the dried roots and stems of a small shrub. 
s Anglo-Saxon meads were traditionally made with the dried flowers of yarrow weed. There’s even evidence that the ancient Egyptians and Chinese made and drank honey-based drinks.
But globally, mead is nowhere near as popular as it once was. As agriculture became prevalent, more easily grown and harvested ingredients such as barley and grapes became the dominant fermentable sugars of choice, and mead fell out of favor. The relatively high price of honey—up to $2 per pound, compared to pennies per pound for malted barley—is still the No. 1 reason mead doesn’t enjoy more mainstream success.
“There is pressure for mead makers to make a cheap 6 percent alcohol—really sweet, carbonated mead that’s put into six-packs of bottles or cans,” says Lyon. “I’m not saying that would taste good, but there’s always a market pressure to do that.” Lyon’s meads, by comparison, are wine-strength and dry, with flavors and aromas 
.
At Agern, beverage director Chad Walsh said that mead is an important part of the restaurant’s identity.
“It’s a nod to our Scandinavian roots,” he said. “Many of our staff are from Scandinavia, and their first taste of alcohol when they were kids was mead.”
Walsh’s beverage list is populated exclusively by American produced wines, ciders, beers, and meads. He says it isn’t difficult to find great American-made meads; in fact, just as with craft beer, American craft mead makers are leading the reinvention and re-popularization of mead worldwide.
One of his most popular bottles is Utopian, a $180 mead from New Hampshire’s 
. It is aged for five years in used Sam Adams casks that once held the brewery’s Utopias beer, a 29 percent ABV strong ale that tastes like Madeira. Thick and sweet with notes of vanilla and Bourbon, the mead is robust and sherry-like in flavor. 
Walsh admitted that mead is a strange, unfamiliar beverage. But, he said, with that comes a tremendous opportunity for education.
“Education is our biggest challenge,” he said. “But that’s what’s great about mead. The palate is really broad, and the flavor spectrum is unrestrained.”
 
The following meads can be hard to find in retail stores, but many are available online directly from their producers. They represent the range of flavors of honey wine and capture the geographic assortment of production styles and techniques from around the world.
This ruby-tinged mead is made from black currants and wildflower honey. The currants add tartness and tannins which is balanced by the sweetness of the honey. Lyon suggests serving it iced, as an aperitif, or mixing it as the base of a summer negroni. (
Mjödhamnen is the project of a nomadic Swedish mazer who travels through the Nordic countryside making mead at different apiaries (bee farms). Suttungabrygden is a rose mead made with heather honey and lignonberries. (
Michigan’s B. Nektar draws inspiration from an infamous 
 character for this lime zest-infused mead with a base of orange blossom honey. Agern’s Walsh recommends pairing it with a simple dish of oysters. As for justifying the crack pipe on the label, he laughs: “[Mead] is a strange scene filled with strange people.” (
This South African meadery is known for infusing mead with such ingredients as chile peppers, figs, and coffee, to varying degrees of success. One of the better experiments is this one infused with tea made from hibiscus, rose hips, licorice, cinnamon, and dried apples. (
This New Jersey-made mead uses a blend of mixed berries including raspberries, currants, blueberries, and strawberries for a blend of sweet and tart flavors. (

=== Title: Wildair Review, New York City - Bloomberg ===

Most people don’t like to watch themselves eat. I learned this at 
, a lovely little wine bar on the Lower East Side, when my friends and I were squashed together at a narrow ledge, directly in front of a mirror. The arrangement was torture—have you ever seen what kind of monster you look like when you’re devouring shrimp with their heads still on?—but luckily Wildair was full of distractions.
First of all, there’s that excellent beef tartare, rebuilt without the egg yolk. The raw meat seems luxurious, sharply seasoned, exhilarated with horseradish and a pale, fluffy snow of smoked cheese and buckwheat groats. You’ll want to eat it just as it is, but also spooned onto warm pieces of sourdough. Then there’s the dish of creamy-hearted white beans, all dressed up in tahini and ricotta, and the beautifully crisp squid you can dip in aioli that’s blackened with ink. For a noisy bar, you’ll find the food is suspiciously good.
Co-chefs and co-owners Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske opened Wildair on Orchard Street this summer, directly next door to their other restaurant and guest-chef hub, 
. It could easily have been a wine-fueled waiting room on your way to somewhere else, but instead Wildair has become a destination.
On busy nights, people crush into the corners with their motorcycle helmets and leather backpacks to fill out the 40 seats, and you’ll notice that chefs, winemakers, food editors, and photographers are all in the mix. This is where they go for a night off—not to air kiss and Instagram (OK, maybe a little bit to air kiss and Instagram), but to enjoy the comforts of good food and wine, reasonably priced, served quickly, and without much fuss.
While Contra is a bit posher and more tightly structured—the restaurant only serves 
—at Wildair anything goes. This means you can get a cool, cloudy glass of 
 and a half-dozen oysters and be on your way, like at some Parisian 
. Or, you can get nice and cozy (especially if you can get a seat at the communal tables at the center of the dining room, instead of the torturous ledge) and just keep ordering rounds for a couple of hours. No one will tell you how things work, or how exactly to proceed, because it’s completely up to you.
The food is polished, but there’s a studied amateur quality to the room that’s also part of its appeal: Tables are shoved together and pulled apart as needed throughout the night. Bottles of water are left at the table and silverware and paper napkins are tucked into the schoolhouse-style cubbies underneath, so things are within reach when you need them. Servers haven’t been coached to introduce themselves to you with a speech, or explain the menu (the menu does not require explaining). Dinner at Wildair doesn’t seem rehearsed at all, more like masterful improv.
Half the fun of eating there is drinking from wine director Jorge Riera’s 100-odd bottles, listed simply by reds, whites, and sparklings. When you ask for tips, it’s refreshing to feel like you’re not being sold, but I sometimes wondered if the waiters hadn’t all sworn an oath, refusing to betray excitement over any one bottle. They play it very close to the chest, relaying the bare minimum of information. This would be awful if they didn’t still lead you toward tastes of delicious things. They usually do.
The plates are fairly easy to share, if you’re sharing, though you won't be nudged one way or another. There’s a halved head of dressed romaine, or sometimes it’ll be butter lettuce, covered with an intricate network of dill and pistachios, bright and fluffy as a patch of happy, flowering moss. An appetizer portion of grated potato pancake, crisp at the edges, capped with sea urchin, is sliced up like a dollhouse cake. The wagyu steak for two (but really for more) should have been an absolute stunner at $85, but it was served nearly blue, a rare disappointment from Wildair’s kitchen.
The pork milanese, at $19, is the other generously portioned thing on the menu. It’s breaded and fried until deeply golden and served with a little dollop of gribiche, that extra sharp and eggy mayo, and a jumble of dressed greens. It could easily be dinner, especially if you’re getting dessert. There are generally two on the menu, including a fine tart: a crisp pastry shell, pleasingly gritty with buckwheat flour, filled above the brim with a smooth, dense chocolate cream. Sometimes there’s a glitter of peanut praline under that chocolate, or hazelnut praline. On a recent evening it was buckwheat praline, nutty and crunchy and almost smoky with caramel.
The chocolate, either by accident, or perhaps as a kind of middle finger to fancy restaurant plating, was piped into the approximate shape of a poop emoji. Maybe part of why Wildair’s so cool is that it refuses to take itself too seriously.

=== Title: How to Buy Wine at Auction—and Why You Should - Bloomberg ===

Maybe you’ve been put off by the numbers. When 10 bottles of 1945 Château Mouton Rothschild go for $343,000, it can feel as though a wine auction is a wee bit … inaccessible.
Or maybe you think buying wine at auction is a stuffy process, involving sitting on uncomfortable chairs in bland boardrooms, raising paddles out of sheer boredom.
Wine auctions, you figure, are not for you.
Well, you’re wrong. Wine auctions are no longer just one thing. I’ve been to raucous live sales where collectors battled for expensive bottles while sipping Krug champagne and savoring food by Daniel Boulud. But you can also bid online while hanging out at home in your sweats and eating pizza from a box, or even while flying from New York to L.A. (unless Gogo-in-flight conks out, as it did for me when I tried bidding on some wine this year).
The fall auction season starts next week. Here’s what you need to know before you play.
The biggest reason to bid at auction is to get rare bottles and old vintages that aren’t readily available in retail shops. (If you’re not drinking older wines at least some of the time, you’re definitely missing out—but that’s another, more expensive, column.)
Live auctions are where you’ll find the splashiest of the splashy, which means case lots of Château Pétrus, grand cru Burgundy, Krug champagne, Pappy Van Winkle bourbon. Putting together a live sale costs a fair amount of money in and of itself (think of those lavish catalogs), so auction houses focus on what will bring in the biggest bucks.
You can bid in person, by phone, or online in advance or in real time, following the sale via audio and video wherever you are. One Russian recently bid from Western Siberia using an the new mobile app launched by the auction house 
.
But attending a live auction is a great way to get a feel for how it all works. You can just drop by, but to bid, you have to register in advance on the auction website. 
I’ve had better luck snagging wines in online-only auctions, which last for a week or more.
Unlike at live sales, most lots contain a single bottle rather than a case, you can up bids by a dollar, and a wide range of wines are on offer. I bought a killer 12-year old cult syrah from Washington State for $55 a bottle, below the original release price. The downside is that it’s easy to forget to check your bid status and lose out to someone else.
The granddaddy of online sales is Winebid.com, founded in 1996, which claims more than 80,000 registered bidders for its weekly auctions. Right now, it has more than 1,000 lots at less than $40 a bottle.
Most traditional auction houses
(
, 
, 
, 
, and Heritage) now hold e-auctions, usually once a month, and even retail shops such as 
 in San Francisco have their own versions.
First figure out what you want to bid on.
“Some people are put off by the massive live auction catalogs,” says Charles Antin, senior wine specialist at Zachys Auctions. “They don’t know where to start because the lots aren’t listed in any kind of logical order, such as region or producer, but inconveniently arranged by consigner.” Hint: Check the index.
The primo live sales this fall include 
 of the cellar of the late Aubrey McClendon, the flamboyant head of Chesapeake Energy; 
 sale on Sept. 9 and 10 of businessman John Brincko’s cellar, and an October sale of La Mission Haut Brion. 
 begins with Part 1 in Hong Kong on Sept. 10; part II in New York on Oct. 15 (the e-auction part begins Sept. 28). 
After you decide what wines interest you and figure out what you feel comfortable paying, check retail prices of wines you plan to bid on at 
 (the Pro version, $48 a year, is worth it). Then look at the catalogue estimates—these are only a guideline, because wine often goes for well over (or under) estimate. But it will give you a good sense of what might be a bargain and what is in your price range. Don’t forget to factor in the buyer’s premium, which can add as much as 22.5 percent to your price.
And remember: If you get everything you want, you overpaid. 
Finally, if you’re at a live auction, don’t hesitate to ask the staff to explain what’s happening or ask for help.
Some longtime collectors complain that no bargains are left.
Jamie Ritchie, president and chief executive officer of Sotheby’s Wine for the Americas and Asia, doesn’t agree: “The market’s the market. There are always things that are undervalued, whether producers, regions, vintages, or specific wines.”
Not everything is wildly expensive. Hart Davis Hart held a sale in April that included Burgundies from 159 different domaines, not all of them big name brands. 
Though prices for the most in-demand great bottles were high, there were bargains for true burgundy lovers, like the single bottle of 1993 Domaine Joseph Roty Charmes-Chambertin Tres Vieilles Vignes, a grand cru, for $573, $200 less than it costs retail, if you can find it. Another steal: two cases of 2011 Domaine de Montille Volnay Champans, which went for $717 each. In shops it sells for $85 to $100 a bottle.
Marc Lazar, owner of St. Louis-based Cellar Advisors, which works with collectors, strategically looks for deals when several competing auctions are scheduled for the same weekend. “That’s a lot of wine,” he says. “People talk about the top 10, but nobody mentions the bottom 50.” 
Mixed lots, which include several different wines or different vintages of the same wine, often go for less, as do wines with stained or lightly torn labels that will still be great for drinking, if not for investment purposes.
Names, regions, and vintages to look for include older California cabernets, such as Robert Mondavi reserve (1969, 1971, 1978, 1991), Ridge Vineyards Monte Bello, Diamond Creek Vineyards, and Heitz Cellars.
Bordeaux vintages 1996, 1999, and 2001 from the second through fifth growths can also be had for reasonable prices. 
Lesser-known Italian reds, such as Super Tuscan Castello dei Rampolla Sammarco, are a good buy. Christie’s Sept. 13-to-27 online sale features a 24-bottle lot of the 1995 with an estimate of $800 to $1,000.
Chablis, some Rhone wines, and Alsace whites are all undervalued, especially in online sales.
But remember: Buying wine at auction can become addictive.

=== Title: BMW M235i Review: The Ideal Sport Coupe If You Get the Manual - Bloomberg ===

Here’s an idea: Have a summer fling.
Have it with the BMW M235i Coupe. It will be very refreshing. Lord knows you deserve it.
I like the $43,000 sports coupe for its plucky drive personality, its enviable gas mileage, and its succinct good looks.
But I do wish it had come with a manual transmission. I wish it had a naturally aspirated engine (turbo-induced 32mpg fuel economy on the highway aside). I wish it had a bigger back seat and felt a little more in tune with me as I clasped the steering wheel and pushed it around corners.
These are not deal breakers. But like most summer flings, it’s best to know about these things before you jump right in. 
Let’s discuss.
BMW introduced the 2-Series last year as a way to upgrade everyone from the 1-Series and compete more directly with the $41,000 Audi A5 and the $44,000 Mercedes-Benz C350 coupes. (It’ll blow right past both the $27,000 Acura ILX and the $27,000 Subaru WRX. I know you rally boys will hate me for saying that, but it’s true.)
Available in either a coupe or a convertible style, the M235i is priced very affordably—under $50,000 even with the $5,000 in upgrades of Harman-Kardon sound, park assist cameras, and heated seats. This in itself is worth acclaim.  
Its eight-speed turbocharged inline six engine packs plenty of horsepower (320hp to be exact). You’ll get to 60mph in four and a half seconds, and you’ll crest 130mph at top speed. The torque under low gears feels snarly—a little heavy, but solid, and with a healthy chip on its shoulder. Staying in comfort mode rather than sport mode helps mitigate the feeling. 
Driving the M235i feels like what driving a compact coupe 
 feel like.
Take it around town and it’ll dutifully conform to the close quarters of urban streets. No one will shoot you bad looks due to excessive engine noise (like in the 
) or flamboyance (anything from 
). The lumbar-supported power seats are comfortable for owners to endure traffic, run errands (the trunk is surprisingly large), cart pets, or commute for hours all day every day.
This car was named among the IIHS Top Safety Picks for 2015; it also earned top placement in J.D. Power and Associate’s most recent Initial Quality Study, which evaluates quality, reliability and ergonomics on every new car in America. Both of which are to say that everything inside and out the M2 feels solid and secure.
Even better, when you gather speed on, say, the West Side Highway, its tight little body stays taut, with no time lost between gearshifts. It has that basic but unquantifiable instinct (that magic mix of torque, weight distribution, suspension tuning, and gear ratios) that impels it to gather itself and then release with the exuberance of a Greyhound escaped from the starting gates.
The M235i looks like what a bimmer 
 look like.
Its body is compact, more so than just a sedan with two doors missing. This is a true sport coupe. It has BMW’s signature kidney grills, low and wide front end, subtle arched doors, and abrupt butt. It’s neither too curved around the sides nor too square at the roofline. It looks straightforward and serious head on, but it’s also sharper, more alert, than the mute flat bodies of some Audis. The proportions are perfect. 
You might as well pay for the $4,100 19-inch performance wheels and Pirelli tires, $600 front splitter, and $80 blackout grill to complete such a high-caliber athletic look. 
I liked the compressed interior dash, too, with its sport cluster of BMW blue-and-white dials and dark alcantara trim. Although the $2,150 “Technology Package” that includes vague things like “remote services,” “BMW apps,” and “advanced traffic info” seems like a waste of money—an iPhone 6 could do those same tasks.
The car comes with a generous list of standard options; topping my list is the two-way power glass moonroof with one-touch operation and sliding interior sunshade. But go ahead and get the $500 heated seats and $500 parking cameras inside. You can also spend thousands and thousands of dollars on carbon fiber accouterments, too, both inside and out, but please, exercise some tasteful discretion.
So this is a good car.
But ... but but but ... it left me wanting a little more. A little more action in the front seat and a little more space in the back.
I can’t help but think of how much fun I 
 have had were my test car equipped with optional 6-speed manual transmission. It’s not a feeling I usually have when I drive these expensive, high-powered cars. Usually you just want them with paddle shifters and enough give in the chassis to conserve emotional energy as you navigate cobblestones, pot holes, and berserk cab drivers.
Yes, an actual manual on the M235i would be slower than the automatic option. But, man, the very thought of the missed possibilities with such an aggressive little stunner makes me groan. If you buy the M235i, get the manual.
Likewise, the version I had came with rear-wheel drive, which is a lucky thing indeed. I can’t imagine what you might hope to gain by paying the extra $2,000 for xDrive. I wouldn’t. You'd lose a tiny sense of contact with the road, versatility around corners, and the ability to really burn out a straight stretch of ground. Buy crossovers and sedans if you want all-wheel-drive and automatic transmissions—don’t buy a sports car. 
If you take away one thing from this review, this above all: do not choose the M228 iDrive over the M235i. If you know you want an M2, do it the proper way. The full way. The price difference between the two coupe variants is substantially more negligible ($10,000) than the difference between their performance.
To wit: The M228i has four cylinders to the M235i’s 6, with 100hp fewer as well. It’s a full second slower to 60mph. So you basically pay 10Gs less for a lesser car. To which I say, "Why waste your time going halfway?" You might as well go all in.
Like that summer fling. It's much more fun fully committed to the moment. The M235i doesn't have to be complicated: Jump in with a carefree attitude, a penchant for fun, and your baggage left on the curb.

=== Title: You Should Have Your Own House Wine; Here Are 10 Great Options - Bloomberg ===

I know, your image of “house wine” is based on some cheap, anonymous vino served in a carafe and short tumblers at a pizza joint. That’s why you need an update.
At a new generation of restaurants, top wine directors offer more aspirational house wines, working with famed producers to create high-quality cuvées designed especially to go with the restaurant’s food. The French Laundry's wine team collaborates with Napa's Schramsberg Vineyards to create the restaurant's house sparkler, Modicum Blanc de Blancs Extra Brut, while Au Bon Climat makes special pinot noir and chardonnay cuvees for Daniel Boulud.
So it’s no longer declassé to order them when dining out, which means it’s not gauche to have them in your home either. In fact, it’s a useful habit, having a go-to red and a white for day-in, day-out drinking, whether relaxed sipping on a deck or with casual meals at home. They’re the vino versions of the basic liquor on your bar. Many of you probably already unconsciously have a house wine, be it a trusty bottle you rely on from your liquor store or a label you buy by the case and keep in the basement.
Not just any wine will work. A house wine has to be something you can pull out and pour without a second thought. Always on the hunt for potential candidates, I look for labels interesting enough to enjoy regularly without getting bored, yet crowd-pleasing enough to open no matter which friends stop by.
Ready-to-drink recent vintages and bright, fresh, lighter wines are preferable to dark, tannic, brooding ones that scream for attention. Luckily, a growing number of top winemakers are thinking along the same lines. 
Seasonality counts (don’t you want lighter wines in summer?), and cost is key. House wines should be relatively inexpensive—my rule of thumb is around $20, as the best value wines today are in the $15-$25 range. And they should seriously overdeliver for the price.
Yes, when I find a good one, I buy by the case to take advantage of retailers’ 10 percent to 15 percent case discount. But always try one bottle first.
Here are my current picks.
 
Any time is a good time for decent fizz. Having some on hand means you’re always ready to celebrate. This lively subtle bubbly is consistently fresh and lemony.
 
Long-neglected Muscadet is underappreciated, and this basic one from biblically bearded Muscadet master Marc Ollivier is reliably stunning. Made from organically grown grapes, it’s in the classic crisp style: citrusy, stony, and salty, ideal with oysters, shellfish, and just about anything with fins.
With subtle savory scents and a suave texture, this medium-bodied, fruity chardonnay has surprising character and elegance for the price. It’s the basic chardonnay from a top winery and a combo of lemon and mineral flavors, with just a hint of oak in the background. It will please lovers of the grape, but not turn off its many haters.
Made from cortese grapes from the oldest vineyard in the Gavi region of northern Italy, this fresh white combines tastes of chalk, green herbs, and citrus. Antipasti, meet your new best friend.
Star California winemaker-of-the-moment Steve Matthiasson created this fresh, bright, citrusy and herbal blend of vermentino, French colombard, and chardonnay to be, well, a house wine. It’s amazingly versatile with food and comes in a 1-liter bottle sealed with an open-me-now crown cap. This is a perfect summer house white.
 
The chateau’s everyday rosé, a blend of cinsault and mourvedre, has everything I want in a stylish pink wine–fresh, delicate herb and lavender aromas, juicy berry and mineral flavors, with a light chalky finish. It will add a grace note to all al fresco dining.
 
A super buy from the Rhône Valley, this spicy, licorice-licked red is a lighter, more gulpable version of a berry-tinged Côtes du Rhône and can be served slightly cool. The secret to this wine’s charm? The blend includes 20 percent white Rhône grapes mixed in with 80 percent grenache.
Beaujolais is a light, all-rounder red that you can drink with a surprising number of foods and can also serve slightly chilled. This one is juicy and vibrant, with subtle spiciness and the taste of berries, bitter cherry, and minerals.
Lively, refreshing, with bright notes of herbs, this blend of cabernet franc and a dash of gamay is modeled on light reds like Chinon. It’s a project by well-known California winemaker Steve Edmunds for Aha Wines. And it comes in magnums, too. 
Barbera is one of the most versatile grapes in the world. The wines are superb with food because of the grape’s bright acidity, which offers just the right amount of contrast to rich, oily dishes. This midweight example, from a top producer, is wonderfully juicy, with aromas and flavors of cherries, licorice, and herbs. 

=== Title: Fishing Tips From Tom Colicchio - Bloomberg ===

Colicchio, the head judge on Bravo’s Top Chef, is the owner of nine restaurants, including New York’s Craft and Colicchio & Sons and Miami’s Beachcraft, which opens this summer. He started fishing when he was 4 years old, crabbing and clamming with his grandfather in Toms River, N.J.; he learned to fly-fish at 26. Colicchio takes his boat out at least 20 days a year. Here’s his best angling advice.
 Find a good captain who will share information with you. But don’t expect him to share it the first time you go out. You have to build a relationship. If you want to go for stripers out of New York, I highly recommend Captains 
 and 
.
 Buy the best equipment you can afford and take care of it. I was on a boat, and we lost a good fish when the reel seized up, because it wasn’t maintained properly. For fly-fishing, I typically use a Sage rod. Reels, you can go with Abel or Tibor. For offshore stuff, I like Accurate.
 I only keep a fish if I’m going to eat it that day. I’m not into catching things, killing them, and freezing everything. It’s wasteful. When I was growing up, there were no striped bass around. They came back in a great way, and now we’re overfishing them again. Bluefin tuna is gone.
If you’re 40 or 50 miles offshore in the Northeast in the summer and you see a log, there’s a good chance there are fish under it. Dolphinfish like to sit underneath things—weed patches, weather buoys, anything that provides any shelter at all.

=== Title: Melbourne by Night: Where to Drink and Eat in Australia’s Second City - Bloomberg ===

The bouncer blocked the staircase to the rooftop bar. He was one of those guys who look as wide as they are tall. I tried a little small talk about being from England. 
He said he was from Iraq. I didn't find that reassuring—although I needn't have worried. Melbourne is an amiable city with approachable restaurants and bars. This guardian of the Rooftop Cinema on central Swanston Street was the most intimidating person I met, and he was superbly welcoming. He let me in and was happy to chat. 
If you're looking for your own friendly nights on the town, here are a few places to try in Melbourne. 
This is a great rooftop bar with a terrace above 
. It feels like a speakeasy. There's no website, and even the Supper Club is hidden behind a plain door at street level. The club (no membership required) is stylish, with bare floors and mismatched furniture. Haul yourself up a few flights of stairs for Siglo, a place to hang out and smoke cigars, if that's your thing. For the rest of us, there are cocktails and wines and an indefinable feeling of being part of the city as you sit in near-darkness and look out to Parliament House. Food is served but this is a place for dates and drinks, more than dining. 
 
The elevator wasn't working late at night, when I wanted to visit this venue, 
 in the city center. You climb through floors of restaurants and music venues—and the Wing Chun Bing Fa Kung Fu Academy—before reaching a tiny staircase, the one guarded by that Iraqi-born bouncer. If you make it to the top, you can choose between sitting and watching a movie or having drinks at a very unfancy bar. When I visited, the bar staff were a bunch of comedians, and I mean that in a good way. I've been less well-entertained by professional comics. This is a very good place to sink a few beers. You may need them after the climb. 
You reach this neighboring 
 by walking through 
 and then cramming into a tiny lift. Not that Goldilocks itself is large or fancy. While there are snacks and cocktails, this is really about the location. Four floors up, it is dwarfed by Melbourne's skyscrapers. But it's a fine place to sit outside on a warm evening, talk, and watch the city lights. It's low-key and atmospheric in an understated way. It is—you might say—just right. 
This unfancy venue in suburban Carlton North looks like any old 
. A yellow awning gives the polished-wood interior a sepia tint. It's how I imagine a bar was in wartime Saigon. In fact, Geralds is a destination for the chef-and-restaurant crowd. Much of that is down to the hospitality of owner Gerald Diffey, who always has time to sit and share a drink. There's also a charm to the high-ceilinged old room, with its colonial feel. 
The wine list and the unfussy food also make it worth finding the time to come here for such dishes as pan-fried swordfish with iceberg and mustard vinaigrette (A$28; US$22.06) and the charcuterie, including game salami with emu and kangaroo served with garlic—just in case you don't find the flavors strong enough. Geralds was one of my favorite places in Melbourne. 
If you are looking for a club vibe, 
 is a good place to eat. You enter along a passageway illuminated by a red neon light. It's a buzzy room in which young diners share street-food style Asian dishes, along with beers and cocktails. It's all very cool. If your focus is on food, it's best to grab a seat at the kitchen counter and watch the chefs prepare dishes such as Peking duck dumplings (A$16); Korean fried chicken ribs; and tempura organic tofu with seasonal vegetables and a tomato-chili dipping sauce. It's not supposed to be gourmet fare. It's fun food to share while drinking. 
     
This 
 in the Crown entertainment complex serves regional cuisine from Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Xinjiang provinces. It belongs to Neil Perry, one of Australia's most celebrated chefs. The restaurant is dark and moody, the way you might imagine a Shanghai nightclub to be. It's not so far removed from the look of Hakkasan, a British export with fans from London to Las Vegas. Spice Temple feels as if it might also work internationally, as there is no shortage of demand for sexy Chinese restaurants, especially ones that get away from predictable Cantonese fare.
The Fat Duck's group executive chef, Ashley Palmer-Watts, picked this place for our dinner and we both enjoyed the big flavors of dishes such as stir-fried quail and peanuts with steamed egg custard (A$38)—spicy, crunchy, creamy—and caramelized lamb spare ribs, which were predictably messy: fatty and sweet, but with a more complex spicing than you would expect elsewhere. 
This is an 
 in Collingwood, owned by chefs Scott Pickett and Joe Grbac, who have both worked in London at the two-Michelin-star establishment, the Square. Here, the emphasis is on light seasonal cuisine at affordable prices. To be honest, I arrived directly from a multi course 
, and my appetite wasn't all it should have been. But I couldn’t resist snacks such as snap, crackle, and pop (A$9): spiced pork crackling that tastes too fat and rich to be good for you. An entree of kangaroo was sliced thin and served rare with native plum and rosella flower, with sweet and sour flavors balancing the insistent taste of the gamey meat. The crispy butternut chicken with 63-degree pullet egg, romaine lettuce, and popcorn was a celebration of texture. At the heart of the dish—right where it belonged—was great meat, beautifully cooked.
 I want to go back again, sit at the bar to watch the chefs at work, and dig deeper into the short menu, which is A$50 for two courses and A$65 for three. Saint Crispin has reaped several awards. It's a friendly and informal restaurant where the casual style stops at the kitchen, which is clearly disciplined. 
Chef Andre McConnell's 
is housed in an old metal works factory in suburban Fitzroy. It's so dark and moody that I needed to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu. I worried that the place might take itself just a bit too seriously until I flipped it on and saw such playful options as an appetizer of fromage blanc cigar (A$6), which contains a tapenade as well as cheese and is served in a cigar case, pork scratchings sprinkled with a kimchi powder, and anchovy pastries deep fried with a real salty kick and a crunch. These are big flavors prettily packaged. You can see how McConnell is influenced by contemporary European gastronomy, but he doesn't copy it. He's an original. Cutler is a restaurant for adventurous diners—ideally people who have grown up on carrots and can see in the dark.
Apart from the excellent cooking,  the other strong attribute of Cutler & Co. is the wine list. The Athletes of Wine Chardonnay, Vinero Romsey 2012 (from Macedon Ranges Victoria, A$89), and its fellow pinot noir were exemplars of modern Australian winemaking: clean and not too jammy. 
 
And finally on to a big beast of Australian gastronomy: 
, in suburban Ripponlea, was awarded 
 in the World's 50 Best Restaurants list, tops in Australia. New Zealand-born chef Ben Shewry draws inspiration from his childhood on the North Taranaki coast, with an emphasis on nature and ingredients over technique and culinary fashion.
There are only tasting menus here, and Shewry dares to be simple. Baby corn is served unadorned in the husk. One snack is curd with honeycomb; a main features a potato cooked "medium rare," in brown butter with a cheese sauce. Blue mussels are beautifully served in a broth with summer flowers. There are stronger flavors, too. Red kangaroo is salt-cured and served in nuggets with bunya bunya. (Bunya bunya sounds like a wild party in Italy but refers to seeds from a forest reserve in Queensland.) There's a rather light black pudding made with wallaby blood and sprinkled with flowers, like a spicy, crumbly cookie.
Shewry has a small garden at the back of Attica, where he will show diners the herbs he is growing. It's good to get outside. The dining room is painted in neutral colors, and it is hushed as guests ponder the A$195 tasting menu. Attica is a serious restaurant. 

=== Title: American Gamay Is the Perfect Summer Red Wine - Bloomberg ===

Ruby-tinged and light-bodied, American gamay noir is a red that's as refreshing as most rosés but more broadly satisfying and lively. Its fruity character and high acidity make it great for pairing with grilled meats and veggies. And like rosé, it benefits from a slight chill—about half an hour in the fridge or ice bucket.
The gamay grape (officially Gamay Noir à Jus Blanc) is native to Beaujolais, the region just south of Burgundy, and can make reds as nuanced as pinot noir—serious, structured vintages, particularly the region’s northern crus. But reared in the States from relatively young vines, it is jovial and fresh, an oddity fringe grape grown in just a few regions for ardent, venturesome winemakers.
“The best parallel is gamay from the Willamette Valley and from the Loire Valley,” said Tim Gagnon of Manhattan’s Chambers Street Wines, “due to the regions’ analogous weather, geographic, and soil conditions.” The grape is also cultivated in New York State, the Niagara region of Ontario, and in California's Sierra Foothills and Santa Barbara County. Here are seven bottles to try.
 
Inspired by the Loire wines of Didier Barrouillet at Clos Roche Blanche, Scott and Dana Frank of 
 make this gamay noir in Northeast Portland from fruit grown in Oregon’s Willamette Valley. The wine is juicy and bright, with black cherry notes and a sprightliness resulting from partial carbonic maceration, a traditional Beaujolais winemaking technique championed by Jules Chauvet (the so-called “father” of the French natural wine movement) in which whole-cluster grapes are fermented amid carbon dioxide before crushing. 
 
 is a project of Mike Roth and Craig Winchester, two East Coast college pals who make deliciously straightforward wines in Santa Barbara County, Calif. This 2015 bottle is a 90/10 blend of carbonic maceration gamay and whole cluster pinot noir from the Santa Maria Valley. The wine is bright and fruity, with great acidity and a tinge of bitterness from the carbonic fermentation.
 
Kate Norris and Tom Monroe moved from France to Portland in 2010 and founded 
, one of Portland’s numerous urban wineries. The couple sources fruit from several Willamette Valley vineyards for a range of gamay wines, including a 2014 "Cru" and a brand new rosé from the 2015 harvest ("L'Avoiron"). Also from the 2015 vintage is Les Petits Fers, a crushable, energetic, and fun wine bursting with strawberry and cherry flavors. Overall, it’s a touch more robust and savory than the Beajolais-Villages wines referred to in its name, which are often lean and vegetal. 
 
If there’s one guy responsible for bringing gamay noir to California, it’s Steve Edmunds. After requesting and getting two plots of the variety planted in El Dorado County (just east of Sacramento) in the early aughts, Edmunds began making his 
, based on the northern Beaujolais wines he loved. The 2014 vintage is pale red in color, with aromas of fresh strawberry, black licorice, and forest floor. The wine has a spritzy acidity and a prolonged, textured finish. Edmunds also make a much-loved rosé version of Bone-Jolly (the current vintage is 2015) from gamay grown at Witters Vineyard, also in El Dorado County. 
 
This wine is a collaboration among three superstars of the California wine scene—Nathan Roberts and Duncan Meyers of Sonoma’s Arnot-Roberts and sommelier and wine consultant Raj Parrr of the Michael Mina group and Domaine de la Côte. Inspired by such cru Beajolais as Fleurie and Morgon, the trio created the RPM label exclusively to showcase the potential of 
, which they source from Steve Edmunds’s Sierra Foothills plots. The 2014 vintage is the fourth and presents a rich, deep expression of gamay, with notes of dried cherries, grassy herbs, and light perfume.
 
Doug Tunnell released his first vintage of gamay noir way back in 1995 (from vines planted in 1992), and he has now expanded his gamay plots in his Willamette Valley vineyards to more than five acres. Tunnell ferments the 
 in neutral oak barrels with essentially no intervention—no additives, no chemicals, no temperature-controlled fermentation. The resulting 2014 vintage is bright, floral, and easy-drinking, with spicy but subtle notes of white pepper and sassafras. 
 
For decades, California producers made wine from a grape they called “Napa Gamay,” which was believed to be identical to the gamay of Beaujolais. But in 1980, following genetic testing, the grape was discovered to be a completely different red variety called Valdigiué, from the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France. Chris Brockway, proprietor of Broc Cellars in Berkeley, stays true to the spirit of Beaujolais, however, with this interpretation of the historic “Napa Gamay.” His 
undergoes 100 percent carbonic-maceration fermentation, resulting in a fresh, quaffable red that’s perfect when chilled and served with a backyard summer barbecue. (Look soon for a 2015 vintage of “real” gamay noir from Brockway.) 

=== Title: PDT Barcelona Pop-Up Menu: Tequila Tonics, Hot Dogs by Top Chefs - Bloomberg ===

How do you get some of the world’s very best chefs together in one place?
It turns out that you mix some drinks and let them make hot dogs.
The iconic cocktail bar 
—the intimate Manhattan watering hole better known by its acronym PDT and once voted 
 (PDF)—is in the midst of a month-long residency at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona. To celebrate, they threw a little party on Tuesday night and invited some impressive guests. Among the crowd were some of the top chefs on the planet, with places that dominate the 
 and rack up 
: Albert Adrià (
); Carme Ruscalleda (
); Angel León (
); and Joan Roca (
).
“It’s the first time in a long time we’ve all been together in the same room,” said Adrià, who is perhaps even better known as the pastry chef at the now-shuttered restaurant, elBulli, in Roses, Spain.
Adrià’s favorite drink of the night—in fact, the most popular among all the chefs—was the Sgt. Pepper. It’s PDT’s nod to a gin and tonic, which isn’t on its menu: a mix of tequila, tonic syrup, lime, Padrón peppers, and club soda.
“The Spanish love gin and tonics,” said PDT’s general manager 
, who is working the bar in Barcelona, along with co-founder 
. In fact, just about every bar in Barcelona has a full page of G&T’s. (Not surprisingly, 
also comes from Spain.) 
“We felt that it would be redundant to bring a gin and tonic to Spain, but that it would be cool to use tonic in an unconventional way,” said Bell. So he created a version with blanco tequila (a favorite in the chef world), plus muddled chiles, concentrated tonic, and a splash of soda for effervescence. “If a gin & tonic is the Beatles, then Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band is Jeff’s tequila-based take on the colonial classic perfected by the Spanish,” reads PDT’s cheeky menu description.
The menu also includes such drinks as Rosé Colored Glass (gin, crème de cacao, and cava) and the Nichol Buck (gin, sherry, honey, ginger beer, and lemon). In fact, it’s a gin-heavy menu: “Spain is the
; they consume more than any other country,” noted Bell. “When we did our PDT popup in Hong Kong, we had a whisky focus, as Scotch is huge in Hong Kong and American Whiskeys are exploding. The goal is to cater to the local palates but to present it in our style.”
Still, it wasn’t just cocktails that drew Barcelona’s superstar chefs to PDT BCN.
In New York, the bar is known for collaborating with chefs to craft gourmet hot dogs to accompany their drinks. So, in Spain, Joan Roca created the Completo Chileno, a beef hot dog topped with truffled avocado, “sauerkraut,” and spiced tomato. Ruscalleda’s contribution is a vegetable sausage with cheese herb sauce, salad, and her initials emblazoned in the bun. Adriá chose to do the New Orleans hot dog. It’s a German-style sausage with Gruyère cheese, smoked bacon, and a secret “New Orleans” sauce.  It just happens to be the one of the best-selling hot dogs at PDT BNC. 
All these dogs—six in total, plus caviar tater tots and truffle waffle fries—can be had at the PDT BCN pop-up through Sept. 30. Set in the hotel’s 
, it is accessed by guests via a phone booth, a nod to the entrance of the New York original that's secreted in an East Village hot dog shop. The cocktail list comprises 12 drinks: nine created especially for the pop-up and three PDT classics.

=== Title: Best New Ice Cream Shops in America - Bloomberg ===

No one is doubting that ice cream is delicious all year round. But in summer, an alchemy of weather and nostalgia just makes every cup and cone taste sweeter. This season, new creameries across the country are catering to our collective love of ice cream with creative flavors, commitments to quality dairy, and thoughtfully considered design. Whether you're more soft-serve with sprinkles or full-blown banana split, you'll find these shops to be anything but vanilla.

 Sour Cherry Chocolate
What do stilettos have to do with sundaes? Not much, unless you’re at Arethusa, a 
 from the 1860s that was rescued from golf course developers by Manolo Blahnik executives Tony Yurgaitis and George Malkemus. This spring, the couple opened an outpost of their country-chic creamery on Yale’s Campus; it serves dense, pure-tasting ice cream in straightforward flavors like coffee, chocolate, strawberry. The secret is the milk, which comes from Arethusa’s cows, a pampered herd that eats grass, sleeps on mattresses, and enjoys daily tail shampoos. (Yep, you read that right.)

 Roasted Strawberry Coconut Soft-Serve 
Artisan toppings like rosé lemon curd, hazelnut butter crunch, and Oregon black raspberry magic shell turn the soft-serve sundaes at 
 into 
—but don’t let them melt while you snap away. Given that they're the creation of cousins Kim and Tyler Malek, of Portland's beloved ice cream makers Salt & Straw, you’ll want to lick up every last drop. The new spot is a cornerstone of Portland’s buzzy Pine Street Market, which brings the city’s top food producers under one roof. “We’ve always wanted to offer soft-serve,” says Kim, “and thought a 500-square-foot space in a new food hall would be an ideal opportunity.”
 
 12
 Strawberry-Elderflower Sorbet
At 
, Chad Townsend draws on his experience in James Beard-recognized 
to create ice cream flavors like yogurt-date, toasted rice with citrus, and Vietnamese coffee. “You won’t find strawberry ice cream on our menu in winter,” says Townsend’s business partner and wife, Lauren, who happily peddles four separate strawberry flavors when the fruit is at its peak. Pro tip: whichever flavor you elect, get it in an oversized waffle cone or sandwiched in a fluffy brioche bun.
 24
 Brown Butter & Toasted Pecan
David Friesen fell in love with Mary Nguyen while they scooped sundaes together at a little hometown spot called Sparky’s Homemade Ice Cream in Columbia, Missouri.
Eight years later, they’re married and Friesen owns 
, Betty Rae's, in KC’s Waldo neighborhood. (It's is named for Friesen's grandmother.) There, he makes two dozen ice cream flavors 
 all the toppings in house, from fudge to fluff, cookies to brownies.

 Ridin’ Duuurty (Oreo milk ice cream with Oreo chunks and salted peanut butter)
Opening in the dead of January—in Minnesota—sounds about as advantageous to an ice cream parlor as a listeria outbreak. But that’s exactly what brothers Sameh and Saed Wadi did when they debuted 
. Despite sub-freezing temperatures, opening-day lines stretched down the block, a testament to Sameh's  previous successes as a (savory-minded) restaurateur. In their cold case are flavors like Thai tea, extra-virgin vanilla, and Pillow Talk, which blends strawberry sorbet with crushed cardamom meringues. Sameh is lactose-intolerant, so about half the flavors are dairy-free.
 
 12
 Mango Mezcal Sorbet
Bay Area residents first got to know 
’s playful flavors (Hot Buttered Rum, Mexican Rocky Road, Negroni) from a tricked-out 1964 Airstream on the local farmers’ market circuit. Now Neil Rider, who worked at Baskin-Robbins in high school, and Kevin Best have two brick and mortar spots: one that debuted in Oakland last year and another that’s just opened in the Financial District. The new space is more 
 than giant at
just 150 square feet, decked out with blue neon signage behind the cold case and compact blonde wood displays. And it's also little known—the address (214 Sutter Street) isn’t even on their website yet.

 Bow Hill Blueberry
Housed in the human magnet that is Pike Place Market and furnished with swivel stools and chrome seltzer taps, this 
 looks like the kind of place the T-Birds and Pink Ladies might go for malts before a pep rally. (More likely, you'll find a mix of visiting families and after-work types filling the tables.) Here, scratch-made soda syrups in flavors like chocolate and cherry are the draw; get them in foamy floats made with ice cream from nearby small-batch producer Lopez Island Creamery, whose hyper seasonal flavors like Mountain Huckleberry and Just Peachy are only found in a handful of outlets across the Pacific Northwest.
 
 20
 Jack and Coke
James and Amy St. Peter are best known in East Dallas for their beloved twin outposts of Hypnotic Donuts. But instead of opening a third spot for their holey baked goods, the St. Peters pivoted and opened 
, a throwback candy shop and soda fountain staffed by teens sporting bowties and paper caps. Why the change? “I was getting frustrated going to dinner then driving home and stopping for ‘ice cream’ at a gas station,” says James. The ultra-creamy cold stuff scooped at Emporium doesn’t warrant air quotes; it comes from Beth Marie’s Old Fashioned Ice Cream in Denton, Texas, an hour north. Classic and custom flavors, like the Jack and Coke, are churned on a machine that dates back to 1927. And naturally, you can get them all sandwiched in fresh Hypnotic Donuts.

 Blackberry-Cabernet Sorbet
Want to pick up a pack of Lucky Feather 
 or Smarties-hued Wayfarers while grabbing a milkshake or waffle cone? You can at 
, which occupies one of several midcentury modern bungalows that make up Palm Springs’ handsome new Arrive hotel. The space is part-souvenir boutique, part-community ice cream parlor peddling county fair-winning flavors from a local producer—and it’s styled accordingly, with sun-bleached wood shelves, hexagon mosaic tiles, and cotton candy-colored neon signage. The scoops fit the bill, too: varieties include date, pink ginger, and passion fruit sorbet. 
 

=== Title: Cliveden House, Site of Profumo Affair, Now Houses a Fine Restaurant - Bloomberg ===

Diners in search of a slice of luxury, seasoned with history and spiced with scandal need look no further than Cliveden, the mansion estate that was the birthplace of the Profumo affair.
Now it is home to 
, one of the most gorgeous places to dine in the U.K. The mansion on the banks of the River Thames has had many famous guests in its more than 350 years, but it is best known today for the affair that brought down a British war minister.
In 1961, Secretary of State for War John Profumo met model Christine Keeler at the pool at Cliveden, where, 
, she was swimming naked. She was also, crucially, sleeping with a Soviet spy.  Profumo later resigned after he lied about the affair in the House of Commons; Prime Minister Harold Macmillan stepped down a few months after that.
(Last week, the U.K. government said that 
 from the investigation into the affair will be sealed until at least 2047.)
These days, that pool, hidden behind a high red-brick wall, is part of a spa at what is now the five-star country house hotel in 
, a pretty village less than an hour west of London.
The ornate, high-ceilinged dining room at André Garrett at Cliveden looks out across the South Terrace to the formal gardens and the river beyond.
The prices are less scary than you might imagine. The lunch menu is £33 ($43.70) for three courses and there is a weekday dinner menu at £55. A la carte is £72.50 and the seven-course tasting menu £97.50. There is afternoon tea at £37.
 
The food is classic, with first-class British ingredients and beautiful presentation by André Garrett, who was previously chef at the Michelin-starred 
, in London. He trained with Guy Savoy in Paris. It's very posh comfort food for the comfortably off.
I went for the £33 market menu, starting with "Ajo Blanco" white gazpacho, with grapes, cucumber, almond and frozen oil. It was creamy and sweet—a little too sweet.
Other options might include raw south coast mackerel with Isle of Wight tomatoes, strawberry, wood sorrel; or guanciale (cured meat) salad, with grilled white peach, blue cheese and candied walnuts.
A whole-roasted quail was beautifully cooked, the meat soft and moist, served with glazed turnip and blackberry in a rich sauce. An alternative, braised Cornish cuttlefish with octopus and bouillabaisse, was a true taste of the sea.
The desserts included English cherry clafoutis with lemon ice cream, but I went for seasonal berries followed by cheese, for which there was an extra charge of £14.50.  A cocktail in the clubby bar next door was £18. The wine prices are not too greedy. A carafe of English white (
 2014), which tasted like New Zealand sauvignon blanc, was £24. There is a Canadian pinot noir—yes Canadian: Le Clos Jordanne Village Reserve (Niagara Peninsula)—at £63 for a bottle whose lightness was perfect for a summer's day.
It's an extra £7 to explore the 
 estate, which is owned by the 
. You could spend a week enjoying it. There are fountains and a maze, and there is a rose garden with more than 900 plants, or you can take a boat on the river. It is beautiful on a summer's day, a world away from London.
Cliveden traces its history to the mid-17th century. Over 350 years, it has been inhabited by many colorful characters, including William Waldorf Astor, who created the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The original house was built by the second Duke of Buckingham, who acquired the estate in 1666. Two years later, the duke killed his mistress's husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, in a duel. Astor bought Cliveden for $1.25 million in 1893.
Before World War II, the house became a center of European political and literary life, with guests from Lloyd George and Winston Churchill to George Bernard Shaw, Mahatma Gandhi and Charlie Chaplin, 
, which now owns the estate. 
If you are thinking of getting into the countryside while the sunshine lasts, it's difficult to think of anywhere near London that combines such beautiful gardens with classic cooking.
It's just a shame that you no longer party in the pool.

=== Title: This Is the Year for New World Wines. Here's What to Buy - Bloomberg ===

In every wine country, vintners anxiously scan the skies all year, hoping weather challenges will still let them make great, or at least good, wine.
So far, 2016 has been a very rough year for Europe’s vintners, with one weather catastrophe after another. Hailstorms in Barolo. Spring frosts, then mildew, in Champagne, and equally disastrous weather events in Burgundy, Chablis, and Beaujolais. In some instances, 70 percent of the crops were lost. Some tiny growers may go out of business.
Now massive wildfires are raging in Madeira and the north of Portugal. So far the vineyards are safe, but that may not last. 
Which all means the inevitable supply vs. demand result of fewer grapes and therefore less wine, no matter what the quality: Expect prices for the 2016 vintage of your favorite wines to go up, maybe way up. Right now your best bet is to hunt down French wines from the great 2015 and very good 2014 vintages (especially in Burgundy and Beaujolais) that are already on shelves.
But for 2016, it’s the New World’s turn to shine.
Martinborough was 
’s star region; with a perfect growing season, it’s a paradise on the country’s North Island for pinot noirs that rival Burgundy. The names to know are Craggy Range Te Muna Road (about $45) and Escarpment ($40).
Overall, 
 had a sensational year, especially in South Australia and the Yarra Valley. From Yarra, try Giant Steps chardonnay ($40), Luke Lambert Nebbiolo ($70), and Mac Forbes pinot noir ($35).
Chile and Argentina were both hit by the El Niño weather cycle, which delivered a cooler, wetter year that resembled one in Bordeaux. In 
, wines are generally fresher and lighter (a good thing, in my opinion). Coastal regions, such as Casablanca Valley, and normally drought-prone Limari Valley in the north did especially well.  Look for Casa Marin Sauvignon Blanc San Antonio Valley ($25) and Concha y Toro Marques de Casa Concha pinot and chardonnay from Limari ($25 each).
For 
, 2016 was the coolest vintage in three decades. In Mendoza, April was a washout, with heavy rains before harvest that will affect the country’s big reds, especially malbec. Yet the Salta region in the northwest produced terrific aromatic whites such as Torrontes (try the one from Colome, at $12), and from Patagonia, the succulent 2015 Bodegas Chacra Cincuenta y Cinco pinot from the Rio Negro Valley, a fine Burgundy alternative, is already on shelves at $50.
The surprise success this year is Canada’s southern 
. Thanks to hot, dry weather after two brutal winters that nearly killed the vines, vintners are calling it picture-book perfect. The wines are hard to come by, but look for the savory Norman Hardie Niagara chardonnay ($30).
So what about the U.S.?
One of the biggest worries is always wildfires, with one now threatening grapes in California’s Monterey County and another that started over the weekend in Lake County, north of Napa.
Elsewhere, it all looks good. 
 expects to celebrate a record grape crop, and maybe the 2016s will bring more attention to the state’s underrated but stunning cabernets and syrahs. It’s been warm, but temperature dips slowed ripening, which means very balanced wines. Top labels include Andrew Will Champoux Vineyard Red Wine ($65), a cabernet-merlot blend, and Betz Family Winery La Cote Rousse Syrah from Red Mountain ($60).   
And then, of course, there’s 
. Napa and Sonoma are anticipating another awesome vintage, with an ideal growing season and just about perfect grapes.
Pinot noir and chardonnay grapes for sparkling wine and some sauvignon blanc are being picked right now. The 2016 vintage may be the one that convinces drinkers that Sonoma’s single vineyard bubblies are really good, especially those from small, exciting cult projects such as Under the Wire ($56) and Ultramarine ($100) that are upstart alternatives to grower champagne.
If you want to assess grapes in Napa for yourself, head to the valley in the next six weeks for the valley’s 
.

=== Title: The 2015 Corvette Stingray Will Make Your Veins Pop - Bloomberg ===

Before I got behind the wheel last week, I was ready to shred the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray—and not in a good way. I had already sharpened my dagger, just itching to plunge it into the 'Vette’s soft, midlife-crisis belly and rip.
The weapons will have to wait for another day. After a week of feeling the muscles of the uncommonly powerful V8 flex underneath me—become part of me—I realized: Never before has a car changed my mind so quickly and so completely as this one has. 
You have to understand. The $73,000 (base MSRP $55,000) Corvette I drove has a major image problem. One simple post I put on Facebook, which included a photo of this silver convertible, inspired comments such as: “It may be powerful but it lacks grace, like the guy who spends too much time yelling through his daily workout at the gym and then walks around in a tank top” and “It's the basic male accessory equivalent of when a basic girl gets Louboutins and thinks she's being super fashionable.”
The best/worst was this: “Owning a Corvette is a great way to let people know you didn't always have money.” All of those were from the audience that should have wanted to buy this car—personal friends of mine who are educated males of means in their early thirties.
Last year Chevy sold 34,000 ‘Vettes. This year, so far, it has sold 11,986 of them, up 2.5 percent over the same period in 2014. The company hasn't commented on who is buying them, but I can say, anecdotally, that I have never seen a woman, a person of color, or anyone who looked to be under the age of 50 who wasn’t an auto journalist driving one. (Barbie, with her fly pink version, doesn’t count.) That’s 
one on any street, at any time—let alone 
 one.
Turns out, it’s their loss. Yes, the Stingray screams like an animal as it blows down the street, which can be obnoxious, and the huge hood covering the bulging V8 engine is phallic by any measure. (You get a bundle of “Compensating for something?” jokes when you drive this.) The sheer lack of subtlety in any form with this car, whether in its styling or its performance, advertises a driver who seems desperate for attention.  
It’s unnaturally hot to drive and miserable over cobblestones, or in traffic. 
But when you drive it fast, it’ll make your veins pop. I had more fun in this vehicle than anything I’ve taken out in the past six months, and that includes the BMW i8, Mercedes-Benz SL variants, and the Jaguar F-Type. I had so much fun with it that I drove for 10 hours one day around Long Island beaches, then drove it out to Southampton and back on a whim to fetch a friend.  
The Corvette Stingray is certainly not for everyone. But anyone in the market for a two-seat convertible toy for weekend driving should give it serious consideration. 
The main thing to know about the Stingray is how special its engine is. Chevrolet has dropped a 6.2-liter pushrod V8 into the rear-wheel drive ‘Vette, which is good for 455 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque. That means that at 3.8 seconds, it’ll hit 60 miles per hour eons faster than an Audi R8, Porsche 911 Carrera, or BMW M3. Top speed is 200 miles per hour. (We’re not even talking about the $79,000 ZO6 and Z07 ‘Vettes, which each have a supercharged V8 engine that gets 650hp.)
You can drive 85mph in fourth gear—and there are seven gears on its manual transmission. (An eight-speed automatic version is available, but please don’t be a baby and get that.) It also has a new rev-matching function, which increases shifting efficiency and finesse.
Driving it feels real, for the first time in your life. It’s not as if you’re in a futuristic spaceship (BMW i8) or a race car (Porsche 911), or on a thoroughbred (Mercedes-Benz SL). Driving it feels as if you have become the car. You feel every piston, every sinew, meld, and thrust immediately when you want, where you want. It’s as if your hands on the wheel and the wheels on the ground are one and the same. Even 
about turning, weaving, swaying, and the ‘Vette will take you there.
The Corvette strikes in a straight line with the certainty of a cobra. But its steering is as responsive as any I have ever felt. It will squirm and fishtail and screech if you ask it to. The chassis is arrow-straight, stiff as an iron rod. Shifting it feels as smooth as a marble mantle. You get the sense that it has much to give. And rather than fighting you like an old Challenger or Charger, the Corvette Stingray aims to please.
I do not like how this car looks. It’s too ballsy for me, with no sense of elegance or refinement. I wish it evoked more of the slim classic Corvette look. But you might like it: The hood is spread wide in front, with an angry air duct front and center, sides rounding over the front tires and a flat open grille straight across the lower bridge. The smallish xenon headlamps sit angled up, far apart on either side, like the eyes on a camel.
From the side, the body has been carved out and then tucked at the ribs before a straight line juts toward the sharp rear. It’s almost geometric in its severity. The quad air exhaust pipes are grouped in a clod at the back, which is flat across the top over the trunk and squared off on either end. There is no softness here, anywhere.
The quality of the trim inside is sufficient but not exceptional. It’s much improved over previous iterations, with GT-style bucket seats covered in bright red leather that feels cheap, compared to anything you’ll feel in a BMW or Land Rover. Carbon fiber accents are available.
That said, the seats are designed well, able to accommodate a long back like mine and to hug my shoulders and hips without confining them. The rear vision backup cameras, dual climate control, 8’-inch disappearing color touchscreen, and camera-recording device are (rightfully) focused on the driver and to that end, satisfactory. The double cup holders and USB plugs strike me as smart decisions to include, even though racing purists scoff at such creature comforts. Chevy also did a great job of eking 29 miles per gallon on the highway with this—astounding for a performance car. (Credit for the improvement goes to improved engine engineering, sleeker design, and a better use of lightweight materials on the body.)
The real problem inside, though, has to do with dimensions. A 6-foot, 3-inch friend who got inside on Sunday struggled at first to fit his lanky legs behind the dash. (This may also have had something to do with his fashionably tight jeans.) We both found ourselves ducking a bit to see stoplights—the top edge of the windshield hit us nearly at eye level with the top down.
Speaking of the top, it’s an automatically powered ragtop that deploys in noticeably longer time than those found in the Mercedes SL and Bentley Continental convertibles. It’s not sealed well enough, with the top up, to keep it quiet inside—also unlike the Merc and Bentley. The button to retract is tucked under the steering wheel on the dash, to the left. It’s out of the way, but nonetheless oddly placed.
Another odd feeling: using a heads-up display while driving a stick. (Most premium cars these days don’t even offer manual versions.) That duality encapsulates something pretty major about this car—it serves as commentary on how Corvette must straddle a half-century heritage with an attempt at relevance in the modern age.
You will sense this struggle if you buy this car. You’ll be forced to explain it in real time to your friends and lovers when they ask why you bought it, rather than something—anything—else.
Just know that you are in the right. And if they drive it themselves, they’ll know it, too.

=== Title: McLaren Unveils Its 570S Coupe, the Brand’s First Sports Car - Bloomberg ===

This evening in New York, McLaren will reveal its first sports car, the 570S Coupe. 
It is intended as a competitor for the Audi R8, the Porsche 911, and the Ferrari California—zippy roadsters meant to be driven on actual roads, not tracks. It will retail for an estimated $180,000, which is a pretty penny but a far cry from the $349,500 675LT supercar they unveiled a month ago at the Geneva Motor Show. (The pricing puts it well above the Audi and Porsche but just under the comparable Ferrari.)
I got up close with the car back in January, in a single-story brick building on the outskirts of a London suburb. It was hidden in a major photography studio there, and when I entered a camera guy whispered to me, “Madonna shot her last video here.”
In person, the mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive V8 coupe looks lean and curvaceous—not too different from its supercar forebears. With its carbon fiber chassis it weighs just over 2,800 pounds, has 562hp, and a sprint time of 3.2 seconds—fast enough to beat a Porsche 911 S to 60mph by more than a second. 
But the point is you don’t have to race with it; it’s OK if you just need to drive it to the grocery store. Robert Melville, McLaren’s head of design, said they’ve “taken every opportunity to increase the stowage.” The interior feels more spacious and comfortable, as well.
McLaren predicts it will triple sales volume by 2020. 
Among racecar headquarters, and I’ve visited a few, McLaren may be the most secretive. It’s certainly the most sterile. 
I drove over there after my visit with the 570S. To access its campus in Woking, England, you must pass through well-manned safety gates and long corridors locked on each end by glass tube elevators. The manicured grounds contain hiking trails and a winding driveway entrance circling a mirror pond. Security cameras abound. 
“We enter through white space to cleanse our mind,” a flack says as we descend a spiral staircase and walk quickly through a stark hallway. I took his word for it. 
Inside, workers on a pristine assembly floor follow strict hours building 1,750 McLarens a year. (By 2016 they’ll make 3,000 and eventually make 4,000 each year, says the company's chief executive officer, Mike Flewitt). 
The job is considered desirable among the locals, and for good reason: Employees get multiple cigarette, tea, and biscuit breaks each day, access to an underground pool and gym, and privileges at a company restaurant festooned with olive trees. 
It’s as silent as a museum—which is fitting, because the company's chairman, Ron Dennis, commissioned his favorite Romanian artist to create glass sculptures that line the interior.   
This is where they make the McLaren racecars too, through thick soundproof laboratory windows along one end of the building. But if you try to take a photo, McLaren minders jump any time your phone turns in the direction of that lab. Corporate espionage, they blame, practically glancing over their shoulder as they usher you quickly past. 
The secrecy is understandable. 
The 52-year-old British brand is the second-oldest racing team in history, behind Ferrari, and among the winningest ever. McLaren is the only team ever to win F1, Can-Am, Indy 500, and LeMans championship titles. 
Last year it placed fifth in F1 team standings. Not ideal. But at the end of the year McLaren-Honda announced an auspicious development, signing two of the league’s premier drivers—Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button—to drive in 2015. 
At any rate, Flewitt hopes the historic successes will carry over to McLaren’s production car business. 
The image certainly has. McLaren Automotive produced the 12C just two years after forming and saw six-month waitlists for the 616-horsepower supercar. The first company retailer was in Hyde Park. 
Since then McLaren has opened 72 dealerships in 32 markets worldwide and has introduced a new model every year, including the $1.2 million P1. (That car sold out in 5 months flat—and none of the people who bought it even test-drove it first.)
Executives say the company was comfortably profitable in 2014, though they declined to specify by how much. And they know there’s plenty of room to expand. 
“In China the typical luxury sports car buyer is in their early 20s and their first car is something like a McLaren,” Flewitt told me. He expects double-digit revenue growth in 2015 with 100 total dealerships open soon after. America is McLaren’s biggest market, followed by Asia and then Europe. 
That’s where the 570S sportscar and 675LT supercar, the one they introduced in Geneva, come in. The latter is a 666-horsepower monster that belongs on the track, up against the Lamborghini Huracan and the Ferrari 458 Speciale. When it goes on sale it will be the highest-powered, lightest McLaren on the market.
And these two cars are, simply put, the only way McLaren is going to grow, since unlike Lamborghini, Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Porsche, BMW, Mercedes—most everyone, really—the brand steadfastly refuses to build an SUV. Its bosses believe that the SUV gives a false sense of security and removes incentive to innovate across the board.
"There is no product range that makes you immune to economic cycles,” Flewitt said. “We are a sports car company, pure and simple. We will never have an SUV.”
If the latest treats from McLaren do as well as he hopes, he may never have to.

=== Title: Is HelloFresh Good? A Top Chef Tests Alongside Marley Spoon, Goose Box, Farmison & Co. - Bloomberg ===

Home-cooking kits have become big business, with companies like 
 shipping pre-measured ingredients and recipes straight to the homes of millions of subscribers. Market leader 
 alone says it sends 7.5 million meals a month to 850,000 aspiring chefs around the world.
But are they any good? And do you get what you pay for? We asked Chef Richard Corrigan and his executive chef, Alan Barrins, to prepare meals from four companies in the kitchen of his Michelin-starred London restaurant, 
.
"Let HelloFresh take care of the meal planning and grocery shopping, leaving you with just the fun part of cooking," the website suggests. 
 at  £36 ($47)
The ingredients are neatly packaged and the recipe is clearly laid out, though lacking in detail. Corrigan is impressed by the quantity of the ingredients: "This is 'fill your fridge with Jamie,'" he says. But he reckons the chickpeas need added zest and olive oil.
Corrigan: "It's a nice plate of food but needs a little bit more seasoning than in the recipe: more chili and garlic in there would do a ton of good. The ingredients are good, and there are plenty of them. But there's an awful lot of packaging and waste."
Score: 7/10
Marley Spoon, the German company that recently announced a partnership with Martha Stewart, offers seasonal recipes and flexible prices, depending on how much you order. We went for two dishes: 
. Our bill came to £29.80. Delivery is free.
The ingredients are neatly packaged, the fish well-chilled and the cooking instructions clear and comprehensive. The salad is colorful and the meal looks attractive on the plate. But Corrigan is troubled by the fact the fish is farmed and by the instructions to wrap it in tinfoil and bake it in the oven. 
Corrigan: "The salad is nice. It is quite girly and healthy until you get to the bread. But there is something Marks & Spencer 1978 about the recipe for the fish. I thought that was when parsley disappeared. Clearly, these chefs are retired and out in suburbia.  It's a lot of flapping about for two little pieces of fish you could put under the grill. I guess they are engaging with people to wrap them in tinfoil so that they think they are cooking. Visually, it looks great. With a glass of wine out in the suburbs, you'd feel great. But it's supermarket fish with supermarket salad. "
This is the super-premium end of the market. Goose Box delivers the goods to make restaurant-quality meals from 
 in London's financial district. We ordered 
for two: Garlic snails with a potato basket (£23); chicken with bulgur wheat (£25); pistachio tart (£15); and ashanti fondant (£15). This might feed four people with moderate appetites willing to pay £78, plus delivery rates, which vary based on location.
The branded packaging is attractive. The recipe is almost idiot-proof, taking you through the process step by step. Even the spices are perfectly measured out and wrapped. Half the work is done for you: There's more assembling than cooking.
Corrigan: "This is a restaurant in a box: No shopping, no chopping. Look at the salad, with all those micro herbs. If you have that on your table at home, it's pretty impressive, isn't it? It is delicious. The ingredients are top-notch. That fondant is very nice, and the pistachio is very accomplished.
"I love the whole idea, but I would question the value. You need to be very lazy, very busy or extremely rich. Is there a market for this? I'm glad you paid, because I'd feel a bit hard done by. If you are going to spend this kind of money, you might as well go a restaurant."
This North Yorkshire-based company says it delivers "an American-style meat feast" from heritage breeds to your door. We tried the 
 at £29.95. Standard delivery is £5.85.
The meal description said it would include "home-made fries," and they weren't kidding: We open the box to find unwashed, uncut potatoes, along with the mushrooms, tomatoes, shallots and a jar of mustard. The recipe called for some ingredients that aren't included, such as goose fat and sea salt. 
Corrigan: "Make your own chips? And wash your own spuds as well? This is the earthier side of home cooking. The recipe isn't good. Anyone who suggests putting a tomato in the oven for four hours needs to be taken out and hit with the shovel that dug the spuds. You want to turn on your stove and cook everything in 20 minutes. The cooking times for the steak are too long as well, and the meat is very fatty, with a lot of waste. [The meat is] very young. It's supermarket quality. There is nothing magical about it."
 

=== Title: Unique Whiskey Blends That Defy Tradition - Bloomberg ===

Can’t decide between bourbon or rye? You might not have to: An increasing number of whiskey producers are combining multiple types of whiskey in the same bottle, in pursuit of unique flavor profiles. Purists probably won’t approve, but these unusual combinations are yielding some remarkably sophisticated sips.
“We’re creating something more complicated, more interesting, more balanced,” says David Perkins, founder of High West Distillery in Park City, Utah, one of the first to trumpet whiskey hybrids, such as BouRye (bourbon + rye), or Campfire, which adds a bit of smoky Scotch to a bourbon-rye mix. “It’s like a meritage in Bordeaux,” a reference to the practice of blending two or more of the “noble” Bordeaux grape varieties in winemaking.
While it’s part of the process to create a recipe of various grains, called the mash bill, prior to fermentation and distilling, it’s rare to see finished whiskeys from different categories mingled together post-distillation. It’s the polar opposite of the prized single barrel bottling—a mutt vs. a purebred whiskey.
Yet, Perkins notes, it’s not as if it has 
 been done. After Prohibition, when stocks were at their lowest, it was common to blend together whatever whiskeys could be readily obtained. And it’s been a longstanding practice among practical Canadian producers, who routinely blend various types of whiskies. (Note: This is a contrast to blended Scotch, which mixes whiskies from different distilleries, but they’re not blending in anything that isn’t Scotch whisky.)
But among modern-day distilleries, particularly American producers? We like to know what we’re getting, and we don’t tend to muddy the rye by mixing in bourbon (unless you’re a bartender—split-base cocktails are a separate thing). And some categories have devoted, verging on rabid, fan bases.
Perkins says High West—which started out blending juice made by others, not distilling spirits in house—cobbled together its earliest hybrid blends simply “to pay the bills.” But it was also a useful differentiator in a crowded market: “There were plenty of good bourbons out there,” he recalls. “Why not do something different and give people a reason to buy?”
Of course, it’s always possible that some producers of amorphously labeled “American whiskey” may very well have mixed whiskey types but haven’t been bold enough to disclose it. “Maybe talking about it, maybe 
 was unique,” Perkins concludes.
Sometimes it’s all about the concept: Diageo and film producer/director Brett Ratner (
 collaborated on the newly released Hilhaven Lodge, a limited-edition whiskey blend incorporating bourbon from the 2000s, Tennessee whiskey from the 1990s, and rye whiskey from the 1980s. The whiskey is named for Ratner’s Beverly Hills two-acre property and is meant to evoke the decades of Hollywood history (more than just three decades, however) behind the luxe private residence.
In some ways, the DNA of products like Hilhaven (and Orphan Barrel, another Diageo line of limited edition “found” whiskeys) owes something to those post-Prohibition pragmatists, who scrapped together whatever hooch they could lay hands on.
“At Diageo, we have access to quite an immense stock of whiskeys from different periods and different distilleries,” explains Gerry Graham, master of whiskey for Diageo, who worked on the Hilhaven project. “This one was from Stitzel-Weller, where we have a stock of very young to very old liquid. It took time to find the right liquids, and then it was up to the blenders to find the right balance.”
Blends of whiskeys of different types and different ages are rare enough. But perhaps the most special blended whiskey of all is one that incorporates different geographies. 
, made by Japan’s Ichiro Akuto of Chichibu distillery, has created a “worldwide whisky”—a veritable United Nations of whiskey made with an unheard-of blend from the countries Akuto calls “the big five”: the U.S. (bourbon, specifically), Canada, Scotland, Ireland, and, of course, Japan. It’s silky and elegant, with warming, almond-like tones and a honey-pepper finish.
In an atmosphere where headlines constantly bemoan the imminent shortage of some of the world’s most tightly regulated purebred whiskeys—namely, bourbon and Scotch, not to mention dwindling stocks of age-statement whiskeys of all provenance—perhaps an expanding lineup of experimental blends are just what we need right now.
 
 
Made with rye whiskey from the 1980s, Tennessee whiskey from the 1990s, and bourbon from the 2000s, this light sipper offers peach nectar, almond extract, and oaky vanilla, finishing with rye-like cinnamon and clove spice. 
Like Hilhaven Lodge, the Orphan Barrel series of whiskeys are made with selections usually sourced from Diageo’s Stitzel-Weller warehouse. This one blends a 17-year-old Kentucky straight bourbon (39 percent) with a four-year-old bourbon and corn whiskey (together, 61 percent), both sourced from Indiana. The end result is a fruitcake-like mix of sherried fruit, caramel, orange peel, and clove. Note: It’s an overproof whiskey (57.5 ABV) and strikingly fiery. 
This hybrid mixes six-year-old bourbon (78 percent) with four-year-old rye (22 percent). It drinks like a bourbon, with a delicious cookie dough-like sweetness, but finishes with rye's signature spiciness. 
Canadian whiskies often are made with a blend of whiskey types, but it’s rare to see that spelled out so explicitly—and this one is particularly quaffable. This cocoa-and-spice sipper mixes Canadian rye, a bourbon-style Canadian whisky, and light grain whiskey. Part of the Noble Collection, a limited-edition series of whiskies set to be released on an annual basis. 
 
A blend of straight rye whiskey, straight Bourbon, and blended Scotch yields a s’mores-like profile, a pleasing mix of toffee plus bold smokiness from the Scotch. 
 
This blend of whiskeys from five different countries, crafted by a Japanese distiller, is nearly impossible to find in the U.S., and when you do, it’s usually priced above $100. But it’s a silky dram, with balanced notes of almond and stone fruit and a bracing, peppery finish. 

=== Title: Le Servan, Paris's Best Bistro, Is Run by the Levha Sisters - Bloomberg ===

It’s Friday night at Le Servan and the couple next to me is involved in some serious negotiating. “
,” says the man. “I really think we should get the sea snails.” He pulls his hair back into a perfectly crumpled man bun. “Oh, please,” the woman says with a note of disgust, “we always get the sea snails. Tonight, I’m in the mood for cockles!” They kiss, then agree to order both.
Meanwhile, a famous French restaurant critic, dressed in brown corduroy and tweed, is polishing off a slice of praline tart with an extremely crisp and buttery crust and spooning up half of a poached pear. Superstar Mexican chef Enrique Olvera, most recently of New York’s Cosme, leans on the bar, sharing a hot plate of sweetbreads with some fellow cooks. Camille Fourmont, who runs a stylish wine bar just down the street, walks in. “I’m hungry,” she announces to a skinny French waiter. Then, 10 times louder, toward the half-open kitchen: “Hey, I’m superhungry! What are you cooking back there?”
Le Servan seats only 38 people at its wooden tables, and a few more at stools pulled up close to the brass bar. But as the room fills up (always, every day), it can feel like the center of the Paris food scene. When sisters Tatiana and Katia Levha opened their tiny bistro last spring in the 11th arrondissement, a few blocks from the twisting maze of tombstones in Père Lachaise cemetery, neither had run a restaurant before. But with its friendly dining room and big plates of polished, unpretentious food, Le Servan epitomizes the city’s new wave of culinary culture—unfussy and affordable, with an emphasis on high-quality ingredients.
Katia, 27, and Tatiana, 30, were born in Paris and Manila, respectively, and grew up together in France, Hong Kong, and Thailand. Their father was a headhunter who specialized in Southeast Asia, and their mother was an artist. The family visited their relatives in the Philippines once a year. The restaurant has the tousled look of a Parisian 
e, but its flavors, borrowing elements from Asia, are deep and complex. Those sea snails, or whelks, so commonly served in Paris with a dollop of mayonnaise for dipping, involve a subtle shot of chili. And the fat French cockles come in a juice spiked with chili and ginger, along with a massive heap of Thai basil—it’s based on something the sisters loved to eat when they lived in Bangkok in the late 1990s.
Veal brains, poached slowly in butter and served very hot, are a crowd pleaser in Paris, and Tatiana makes a mean version with wilted, lemony sorrel leaves. Diners’ relationship with chicken wings, however, is far more tenuous. “People in Paris don’t chew as much on bones as in Asia or the States,” Tatiana explains the next morning, while a waiter mops the floor and a delivery of heavy cream and butter arrives. She sneaked wings onto her menu all the same, cutting the knuckle off so the presentation could be somewhat cleaner and more delicate. The wings are braised for a few hours in the oven, then left to dry out before they’re fried; the thin shell of crisp skin gives way to extremely tender, thoroughly seasoned meat. The liquid from the roasting process, made smoky with pork belly, then reduced and seasoned with soy sauce, black vinegar, and a smidge of hoisin, comes on the side for dipping. It’s a fantastic way to start dinner, especially with a glass of the dry Vouvray from Sebastien Brunet on Katia’s list. Chances are, the wings won’t be on the three-course menu for long. Dishes at Le Servan change daily, sometimes even from lunch to dinner.
Before she was drawing chefs and critics from around the world to Le Servan, Tatiana was serving family-style pots of walloping-hot Thai curry and peppery adobo to her literary college friends. “I just loved to cook for a lot of people,” she says, sitting up very straight in a booth before lunch service begins, a puffy winter coat over her chef whites. Tatiana came close to graduating from the Sorbonne with a degree in English literature but ditched academia for culinary school at the last moment. She worked her way into some of the city’s most glamorous kitchens, showing such promise after six months as an intern at Pascal Barbot’s L’Astrance that the chef called up his mentor, the great Alain Passard—a vegetable whisperer, if you believe in such things—to see if L’Arpège needed a cook. Tatiana worked with Passard for two years.
As her sister was sweating it out in the kitchen, Katia explored the front of the house. She went to hotel school in Switzerland and then waitressed at the bistro Le Baratin in the Belleville neighborhood of Paris. There Katia learned about the world of natural wines and the way a truly wonderful bistro becomes like an extension of the owner’s living room.
As a cook, Tatiana mastered not only technique and stamina but also negotiation—dealing with the city’s best purveyors of everything from butter to fish to vegetables. Le Servan orders from many of the same suppliers that L’Astrance and L’Arpège do, though none are mentioned by name on the menu, or by the waiters, or even at all, because that would be terribly gauche. The purple Brussels sprouts, sweet and as vividly flavored as they are colored, picked when very small, are referred to as young cabbage. “When we call it young cabbage, more people order it,” Katia says, laughing. When one sister laughs, she sometimes sets off the other. “If we call it what it is, purple Brussels sprouts?” Tatiana asks. “
.”
The cabbage on the menu today, which comes with a mid-rare strip of pleasingly tough French beef, is a different variety: 
. “It’s actually really good, for a cabbage,” Tatiana says. She gets the big variety, the French kind with a purple-washed heart, from one of the last purveyors in Île-de-France who thinks they’re worth the hassle, then slow-cooks them whole so they stew in their own juice. After the kitchen aggressively chars the edges, the cabbage resembles a frilly dress that got singed in a fire; it tastes sweet and smoky, as if it’s been roasted in a pit.
Neither of the Levhas has a driver’s license. To pick up some of the esoteric vinegars and specialty Asian ingredients they need, Tatiana rides her dusty black scooter to Belleville’s Chinese grocery stores or over to a Japanese purveyor on Rue Sainte-Anne near the Palais Garnier opera house. Otherwise, she says, she hardly leaves the neighborhood, because why would you?
Even if you don’t hit the architectural highlights of the 11th arrondissement—the neomedieval cathedral on Boulevard Voltaire, the extravagant troubadour facades, the deco doorways—the district is astonishingly lovely. Along its streets are storefronts with rotisserie chickens, rabbits, or suckling pigs beside shops with spinning spits of lamb 
. Smokers linger over coffee behind the clear plastic walls of winterized cafes. Teenagers from out of town wander by, looking for the cemetery so they can leave the mark of their lips on the glass  guarding Oscar Wilde’s tomb.
At night the side streets here feel quiet and residential, but during the day the neighborhood buzzes, packed with so many little spots run by young, energetic crews like Le Servan’s. From the wine bar La Buvette to the lunch canteen Chez Aline, in a former horse butcher shop, to the chic expat hangout Bones, small, exciting food businesses are thriving in the 11th. The Levhas were able to get their space, a former coffee shop, because, they say, rent was comparatively low for central Paris, a likely reason for the recent boom.
Bistros are vital, bistros of all sorts, but there’s something about Le Servan that feels essential to understanding Paris right now. Although it maintains the generous spirit of the classic iteration, the restaurant also offers an accurate representation of the city as it really is: a massive mix, rich with immigrant culture, where the meaning of French food is changing with new influences all the time.
Later that Friday night, the sweet music of Le Servan is turned up all the way—the slamming drawers of cutlery, the boom-hiss of the espresso machine, the constant ding of a brass bell as the kitchen pass fills up with dishes. A woman in a white tuxedo jacket eats her first bite of roast chicken, fluttering with smoky-sweet bonito flakes, and moans. Soon waitresses in bright-red lipstick and indigo aprons start to pass along the word: The kitchen is out of chicken.
Tatiana is working quickly and calmly, her dark hair in a tall, Dr. Seuss-ian pile at the top of her head, her cheeks flushed from the heat of the stove. She tastes what’s going in and out while cooking slabs of brill so the skin is crisp and the flesh is juicy. She calls tickets out to her cooks as they push through the kitchen’s last round of orders. At 11 p.m., Katia is still, very gently, turning away people who didn’t make a reservation, hoping they could get a seat late in the evening. She does this the way she does everything at Le Servan—gracefully, and with a smile that says she means it.
On their way out, diners swing by the kitchen to thank Tatiana and her cooks, telling her what they liked best, wishing her a great weekend. Standing at the door, Katia waves them off like they’re old friends, even those who aren’t. “Good night, good night! See you again soon!”
More wine bars, bakeries, and restaurants to visit in the neighborhood.
Camille Fourmant’s tiny wine bar is one of the loveliest places in town to pass a few hours chatting over natural wines from little-known French producers and a plate of excellent cheese, salad, and marinated sardines.
Drop by Bertrand Auboyneau’s classic bistro for exceptional egg dishes, terrines, and steaks for two. And whatever you do, make sure you try the fries. 
Australian chef James Henry serves an exciting tasting menu in the dining room of this expat-packed wine bar. Sit up front for a great glass of wine and small bites like house charcuterie. 
Delphine Zampetti converted this former horse butchery into a lunchtime canteen that serves the working crowd around Voltaire station excellent sandwiches, salads, and hot plates. 
You can’t get a table at Septime, we know. Go instead to Bertrand Grébaut and Théo Pourriat’s newest sister spot, a modern seafood-focused bar with excellent small plates. No reservations. 
Don’t miss this traditional French pastry shop’s gorgeous version of the kouign-amann, a specialty with roots in Breton that gleams with layers of caramelized butter and sugar. 

=== Title: The Most Fascinating Travel Destinations for Wine Lovers in 2016 - Bloomberg ===

So you’ve been to Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Tuscany and splashed out for the exorbitant winery tasting-room fees in the Napa Valley. Where next?
The current oeno-tourism boom means you don’t have to sacrifice luxury if you branch out to less-traveled spots.
An ever-growing number of wineries are wooing curious wine lovers with sophisticated boutique hotels, serene infinity pools, soothing spas, Michelin-starred restaurants, and insider experiences such as harvesting grapes at midnight wearing a headlight.
My criteria for what makes a great wine destination starts, naturally, with truly superb wines. And spectacular scenery is a must, as is fabulous, creative food.
But beyond the grape and the glass, I want other experiences—not just the option of being pummeled with grape skins or lolling in a red wine extract bath. 
The following destinations offer these luxe options in spades.
 
Take 
, a dramatic art-centric wine resort that opened last year in Chile’s Millahue Valley, a two-hour drive south of Santiago. It’s a rare combination of raw nature, cutting-edge art and design, and ambitious red wine.
The vineyard and winery came first. Norwegian-born entrepreneur Alexander Vik had a eureka moment while running the Bordeaux marathon, and he and his wife Carrie started hunting land where they could “make the best wine in South America.” With the help of star Bordeaux winemaker Patrick Valette, they found an 11,000-acre property of sloping hills, a glassy lake, and spectacular views of the forested Andes mountains in an undeveloped valley and planted vines. 
A fabulous resort was always part of the plan—and 10 years later, it's a reality. Perched on a hilltop overlooking the vines, the hotel has a cantilevered slate pool jutting over the valley below. Staying in one of the 22 suites is like living inside an installation of a single artist’s work, with a glass-walled view of vines. The winery entrance is even enchanting, with a sloping plaza with streaming water and artistically placed rocks, crisscrossed by wooden walkways.
When you’re not oohing and aahing, tasting the two red blends (powerful, plush Vik and velvety Milla Cala), horseback rides to neighboring vineyards and joining the harvest will keep you busy. 
Suites start at $1,200 a night, including meals, wine, mountain biking, horseback rides, and tastings.
 
, on the tiny, peaceful island of Mazzorbo 
, is the ultimate urban vineyard resort and surely the only wine destination where you can learn how to row a gondola. And it’s only 20 minutes from Venice proper by water taxi.
A decade ago, Gianluca Bisol, whose family makes top proseccos, discovered almost extinct dorona grapes in a private garden on a lagoon island. For centuries, until a flood in 1966, these islands fostered a thriving winemaking culture. Bisol delved into grape research, using the vines he’d discovered to revive this ancient white variety in a tiny walled vineyard on Mazzorbo, then renovated the large country house within it as a six-room boutique hotel and restaurant. (The recently released white and red, made from grapes on a neighboring private island, cost $200 a bottle.)
The spacious suites (from $275) are the best bet, with exposed wooden rafters and simple, elegant furnishings. Staying here is like being in the midst of a wine fairy tale, complete with once-lost grapes now found and side trips across a wooden footbridge to Burano, a colorful island of lacemakers. In Venissa’s one-star Michelin restaurant you can taste the winery’s violet-scented red and intense, slightly salty white, which both pair nicely with local lagoon delicacies such as sea-snail soup.
 
This 60-mile-long narrow peninsula in Western Australia’s southwest corner, three hours south of Perth, is an irresistible wine paradise. 
 is known for world-class surfing, secluded coves of wild, sandy beaches, and air scrubbed whistle clean after its thousands-of-miles journey across the ocean. On top of this, its 100 wineries make some of the country’s most sophisticated and collectible cabernets and chardonnays.
You can spend the morning tasting, the afternoon lolling in the surf, hitting the reef breaks, or hiking part of the long coastal Cape-to-Cape track with views of the Indian Ocean. In the evening, dine at a winery on local marron, a succulent freshwater crayfish, and, yes, kangaroo steaks.
The essential estates to visit are 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
, whose sleek, lemony chardonnay is one of the world’s best, and which offers the top daylong wine experience. Though most wineries have restaurants, none offers luxe accommodation. My pick for a romantic hotel is 
in Yallingup, a secluded group of villas right on the beach, with private plunge pools and access to a private chef (rooms from $800 for two nights).
  
No wine region surprises you more with its beauty than the sleepy, remote Douro Valley. The Unesco World Heritage site is a 90-minute drive from the city of Porto, in the northern part of Portugal. Flanking the winding Douro River are stone-terraced vineyards on steep, vertigo-inducing hillsides dotted with whitewashed 18th and 19th century quintas (wine farms). For centuries the quintas were difficult to reach. Driving the twisting road can still be a white-knuckled proposition—one scenic 17-mile stretch, from Peso de Regua to Pinhao, has 93 hairpin curves.
This is home turf for sweet vintage ports, but more recently dozens of port houses have begun making luscious dry reds from such grapes as touriga nacional. Quinta do Vallado (delicious dry reds) offers privacy in the vineyards at its new six-suite 
 (from $210) in Vila Nova de Foz Coa, while port house 
 in Pinhão opened for superb tastings, tours, and lunches last summer.
But the latest extraordinary place to stay, opened last year, is 
 in Lamego (from $577 during high season; suites $1,386). Blue and white azulejos (tiles) and cork ceilings echo the region’s aesthetic. Besides the requisite gorgeous pool, aerial yoga (it’s very complicated), and wellness spa, the staff can arrange private quinta visits and a day picking grapes and crushing them by foot in a traditional square stone trough called a 
. Prepare for purple feet.
  
The Cape Wine Country is a tapestry of lush green vineyards, craggy hills, 17th century white-washed Cape Dutch farmhouses, and sleek, glamorous contemporary wineries. South Africa's stunning wines are still under the radar and deserve discovery.
Picturesque Franschhoek is east of better-known Stellenbosch and an hour from Cape Town. Its appeal is contrast—ringed by towering, dramatic mountains and nature preserves ideal for hiking, it’s also studded with 50 wineries, super-luxury places to stay, and shops and restaurants with French flair.
Settled by fleeing Huguenots, it now attracts such people as Sir Richard Branson, who bought wine farm (and hotel) 
 two years ago, and Indian entrepreneur Analjit Singh, the founder of the local 
boutique hotels, as well as new hot micro-brewery 
. Just-opened 
 (from $506, suites from $830) is set among sauvignon blanc vineyards with brick walkways and gardens and includes a winery, boutique hotel, and wellness spa; the Mullineux-Leeu wines are stellar.

=== Title: Gin Mare Is the Best Martini Gin - Bloomberg ===

Among American gin-lovers, Gin Mare is the stuff of urban legend.
The Spanish gin, made with arbequina olives, thyme, rosemary and basil, was a bracing, savory sip that lucky travelers might have encountered on a trip to Europe. Maybe (like me) you were in Madrid, enjoying it in a gin-tonic, noticing how the faint salinity paired so well with paper-thin slices of 
. Compared to London dry gins, which play up brisk, pine-y juniper, this was more like a briny ocean breeze.  
Yet unlike most tall, tapered gin bottles, the Gin Mare bottle is pyramid-shaped and weighty, not exactly ideal for packing. So maybe (like me) you thought, “I’ll just pick up a bottle when I get home”—only to find that it wasn’t available in the U.S. For years on end, it was “coming soon!” but soon never quite seemed to arrive.
“Soon” has arrived. Gin Mare (pronounced 
) quietly arrived in New York area stores about six months ago and continues to expand stateside. Bartenders are particularly delighted. Many claim that this is the only gin worth sipping neat.
“I can’t think of any other gin in history that I would want to drink straight-up,” declared Soraya Odishoo, head bartender at 
, which carries exactly two gins: Beefeater and Gin Mare. “It’s a very botanical gin. It has thyme, basil and olive, which really bring out the medicinal qualities of gin in a way that I’d never tasted in any other gin.” At home, Odishoo keeps her bottle in the fridge (“It’s a spirit that needs to be cold”), then stirs the gin with ice and strains it into a chilled glass with a lemon twist.
“Classically, that’s a gin martini, no vermouth, served up with a lemon twist,” she admitted. At the restaurant, Gin Mare is more likely to be served in cocktail format, as in the Albion (Gin Mare, lemon juice, Averna amaro, housemade blackberry-juniper soda).
Meanwhile, at 
, a San Francisco bar with 400-plus gin bottlings, Ginoisseur (yes, that’s really her title) Keli Rivers also favors Gin Mare for sipping neat “because of the mouth-coating quality of the arbequina olives.”
 
Rivers was first introduced to Gin Mare two years ago at New Orleans cocktail conference Tales of the Cocktail, where London bar Nightjar hosted a pop-up bar that included bottles flown in just for the event.
“I was blown away by the amount of viscosity, body and savory notes—that it didn’t overwhelm all the other botanicals and citrus,” she recalled. Back in the Bay area, Rivers relied on contacts in Europe and Mexico to bring in the occasional bottle for the bar, or she would break out her own stash to pour. As she introduced patrons to the gin, predictably they would want more of the olive-spiked elixir.
“It was probably the most asked-for bottle that we didn’t have access to,” Rivers noted. Because it was so challenging to obtain, Whitechapel was forced to charge a premium $22 a pour. “Even with the heavy price hike, people still wanted it.”
She likens the appeal and demand to that for Hendrick’s Gin, circa 2008, when the gin with a then-novel cucumber and rose petal flavor profile began to take off in the U.S. The mouthwateringly savory style of Gin Mare is similarly distinctive and different from traditional London dry gins, Rivers theorizes.
It’s also helping to pave the way for a growing wave of gins with savory or umami notes, whether those come from olives, bell peppers, or even seaweed. 
Rivers, too, prefers hers neat, although she’ll also recommend Gin Mare in a martini, whether that means 3 parts gin to 1 part Noilly Prat vermouth, or a more dramatic 5:1 ratio using Dolin Dry. It’s also the gin she breaks out at the very end of a tasting session.
“Are you ready for something out there?” is how she prefaces that final pour. “This will completely blow your mind.”
Try this mouthwatering olive-infused sip in a minimalist Martini, adorned with little more than a plump Manzanilla olive. 
A briny gin made with foraged nori, bay sage, and lemongrass. 
 
Made with a stunningly long list of botanicals—47, hence the name—the flavor profile is predictably complex, including a mushroom-like savory character. No, mushrooms are not part of the gin. 
Made with black pepper, red bell pepper and pimento, this racy gin bridges spicy and savory notes.
 

=== Title: Vaucluse Review: Inconsistency Stings New Michael White Restaurant - Bloomberg ===

After a hot, dry summer in northern Italy, white truffle season kicked off in early October with a small haul. One importer quoted a wholesale price last week of $2,400 a pound (although this figure included delivery, via FedEx). If you’re still playing, half the fun is to marvel at the prettiness-uglyness of the thing: The white truffle is a homely lump the color of milky diner coffee, with a gorgeous, complicated scent that can turn heads. 
After a few soft clicks against a mandolin blade, held at about the same level as your nose, that scent intensifies and wins you over. It’s the reason you’ll pay so much for a fungus that's been dug up from the earth by pigs and dogs.
On my first visit to Vaucluse, the new 170-seat French restaurant in Michael White’s group Altamarea, I ordered a comté crêpe with hazelnuts and truffles, anticipating that aromatically-charged moment. But it arrived already scattered, with three grams of white truffles. There was no show of shaving at the table, no detonation of perfume, nothing. Sure, the crepe was very good, supple and oozing with a cheese sauce and shiny as an evening gown. But the truffle was dry, its flavors weak and dim. It was not up to the task of justifying the $59 expense for a single, cheesy pancake. 
On a different evening, I ordered the fresh tagliatelle dressed in butter with tiny threads of ham, which involved a truffle shaved at the table. This time, it felt more like a luxury. The truffle also seemed to be of higher quality. Either way, it was a better experience.
Vaucluse, a decidedly posh French restaurant on the Upper East Side, can be infuriatingly inconsistent. Too often, unreliable service undercuts the kitchen. (On one occasion, it took nearly 30 minutes of sitting with closed menus to get a waiter to take my order).
White is better known for his Italian places, including Marea, Osteria Morini, and Ai Fiori. Vaucluse is his first French-leaning restaurant, which seems in step with the recent wave of young 
 having fun with such oldies as duck a l'orange and chocolate souffle. But at times, the serious brasserie can feel less like a reimagining and more like a kind of luxurious regression.
Jared Gadbaw, previously chef at Marea, staged briefly at Plaza Athénée in Paris to gear up for full-on Frenchiness. Some of his dishes are excellent, including the red Camargue rice: slightly chewy and very delicious, served with fat Burgundy snails out of their shells and a load of garlicky butter. The rib-eye, aged under a thick layer of rendered, aged beef fat, is a deluxe steak frites with your choice of sauce. Although no one even asked how I’d like it cooked, it arrived with a perfectly juicy, mid-rare center and a thick, nicely browned crust.
I’m not sure I understand why the duck for two is a dish “for two” when it involves twin plates of sliced breast meat ($46 per person) and a vegetable gratin. But that darkly tender meat, aged for just about three weeks, is exquisite. 
Discrepancies appear in other sections of the expansive menu. While the leeks vinaigrette with toasted almonds were brilliant, tender, and bright, the poached egg with red wine jus and lardons involved a thick slice of undercooked delicata squash. One night the skin on the roast chicken was soft and flabby, while the trout with lemon and capers was essentially perfect. The skin on the latter was evenly browned, speckled with tiny pieces of bread crisped in butter. 
Vaucluse has been open for only a couple of months, but it can have the feel of an old New York dining room with rotating regulars. In the evening, its soft, cream-colored banquettes are packed with cream-colored people in tweed and tailored wool blazers with knotted silk scarves. Women in designer power suits and massive, glittering cocktail rings eat scallops glazed in brown butter. A small family celebrates a patriarch’s 90th birthday. 
When you're finally asked, do order dessert. Alina Martell’s creations lean to the classical, and they’re beautifully constructed and flavored. Martell isn’t the only New York pastry chef to have put a good old Paris-Brest (that ring of choux pastry filled with praline and butter-enriched pastry cream) on the dessert menu lately, but her version is one of the best. The pastry is wonderfully airy and light, crisp at the edges, and the mousseline filling is cold and rich, not too sweet.
While chocolate soufflé is a cliché, here it’s just how it should be served: hot and cooked-through properly, yet steamy and delicately textured.
It’s just the thing in this dining room, all plush and beige and softly lit. Though it doesn’t matter how comfortable the chairs are, no one wants to wait 30 minutes to order dinner. 

=== Title: Five Best Colored Cotton Suits for Summer - Bloomberg ===

It is cotton suit season.
At the Cannes Film Festival last month, men from Ryan Gosling to Clive Owen to 
 Laurent Lafitte ventured beyond tuxedo territory and explored the cooling embrace of light-colored cotton suits. The material is perfect for the breezy, sunny Cote d'Azur, but it works in so many occasions—even the office.
This past season, colored cotton suits also stomped down the runway at fashion shows for brands like Bottega Veneta and Todd Snyder. 
The looks were single breasted, with 
 notched lapels and a slightly relaxed fit—perfect for slouching around on hot days.  
"A khaki suit is a great starter suit when a guy begins to explore seasonal fabrics in tailored clothing," says Eric Jennings, VP and fashion director of menswear of Saks Fifth Avenue. But a man shouldn't stop there. "Once he has the perfect khaki cotton suit, then it’s time for him to explore seasonal fabrics in other colors."
Jennings suggests that the colors "beige, blue or olive are best" to experiment with at first. "Avoid pastels—they can be fun worn as a separate trouser or sport coat, but not as a suit."
How to style a cotton suit? Pair it with a crisp white sneakers or a 
(with or 
), depending on how formal or casual you want to go.
Celebrity and fashion stylist Sam Spector, who has dressed the likes of Neil Patrick Harris and Jake Gyllenhaal, says "I love a cotton suit with a knit polo underneath, with a tee and sneakers, or with a light-weight crewneck knit sweater." Spector continues: "The same suit can be worn in all these different ways making it a great staple piece to have for summer."
Todd Snyder, president and founder of his eponymous label, agrees. "It's very versatile.  You can dress it up or down depending on the occasion," he says. "It's perfect for a wedding with a shirt and tie or you can wear the jacket with off-white jeans and a tee for a summer dinner."
Here are five great options to try out this year.
Navy is an easy, masculine color to pull off, and unlike khaki it goes with almost everything. Since it's a staple, don't go for one that's too dressy. The J.Crew Ludlow suit is reasonably priced, and well-cut. ($456,
)
 
This olive suit from Massimo Piombo is different enough to make a statement, but doesn't veer into 
. If you're new to the color, ease in by breaking the suit into separates, wearing the blazer with a pair of dressy jeans or the trousers with a soft spring sweater on top. (Blazer, $720, 
; Trousers, $165, 
)
 
You don’t often come across a pinstripe cotton suit, so when you do, snag it. If your day-to-day or special events have a more formal bent, this is one way to stand out while staying cool. ($499, 
)
 
If you'd rather whisper than shout your style choices, a light gray cotton suit is close enough to khaki to feel classic but different enough to get noticed. The peak lapels on this Dsquared2 option help it stand out. ($1,690, 
)
This is the most playful option on this list; Italian label Boglioli's sky blue number will make you the star of any party, so be sure that's what you want before you throw it on. If you do, keep everything else simple, and pair it with a crisp white shirt and light calf-skin loafers, without socks. ($1,395, 
) 

=== Title: 10 Perfect Session Beers for Crushing on a Summer Day - Bloomberg ===

Broadly speaking, what beer fans call a “session beer” is one that should wield a low enough alcohol content that, if consumed in succession during one sit-down “session” of drinking, one doesn’t get 
 inebriated. Now, the specific line of demarcation in alcohol by volume (ABV) that constitutes a session beer is subjective. However, for the sake of ultimate refreshment during record-high temperatures this summer, let’s call it below 4 percent. Here are 10 easy drinking examples that run the gamut of flavor, listed in order, from highest to lowest ABV.
 
OEC is one of America’s most exciting producers of Old-World-meets-New-World sour beers. Their Exilis is a Berliner Weisse (a cloudy, sour style of beer born in Germany) that is partially fermented using natural yeasts native to the air around the brewery. It is tart and very thirst-quenching, with lemon acidity, herbal funk, and a bone-dry finish.
 
Off Color is an aptly-named idiosyncratic brewery that focuses mostly on lesser-known historic styles of beer. For Fierce, this variant of its Berliner Weisse, the team added Asian citrus fruit Yuzu. The resulting taste is remarkably akin to a Sanpellegrino Limonata, and is therefore almost dangerously refreshing.
 
Of all the New England farmhouse craft producers, Oxbow is the most modestly excellent. (Its slogan is: “Loud Beer From A Quiet Place.”) For La Griseta, they collaborated with punky Spanish brewery Naparbier for a gently tart beer in the style of old-school Belgian Grisette, a Saison-like format that’s becoming more and more popular these days. This one is citrusy, grassy, and dry throughout.
 
Brasserie Dupont reliably brews great, archetypal Belgian Saisons. Their Avril is one of the more enjoyable true table beers on the market that’s generally readily available. It boasts fresh, yeasty aromatics, bubble-gum softness, and an underlying spice character.
 
Bissell Brothers is known for unapologetically turbid, hop-forward beers. For Diavoletto, the brewery managed to keep the robustly juicy characteristics from its bigger beers but find a more modest alcohol level. The bite of the hops is dank, but the mouthfeel is light, and there are enjoyable floral side notes.
 
The brewers at Jester King are passionately committed to antique farmhouse practices, combined with forward-thinking aesthetics when it comes to their bottles. Le Petit Prince is their table offering, perfect for immodest gulps at mealtime. Fantastically easy to drink, it has a light barnyard funk and a pleasing, peripheral tartness.
 
The U.K. has long been the de facto epicenter of session beer (see: cask ales in pubs), and London’s the Kernel has turned the tradition into an art with its Table Beer. While ABV and hop varietals vary from batch-to-batch, deliciousness is a constant. A recent 2.8% Citra-hopped release was beautifully citrusy, clean, and ephemeral on the palate.
 
The pool of gypsy craft brewers (beermakers who use other people’s facilities to make their own brews) has grown a huge amount in recent years; it can even be hard for one of them to find to space to use now. But Evil Twin brewer Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergsø manages to churn out beer after delicious beer from some of the most prominent craft breweries in the world. The goal of Bikini was to make a delicious beach-ready crusher, yielding roughly half the alcohol content of most similar macro-brewed options. The result is nicely bitter—yet not astringent—and it's incredibly refreshing.
 
De Garde releases some of the most sought-after sour beers made stateside. Berliner-style Bu Weisse is the base for many variants that De Garde barrel ages with different kinds of fruit. At a kombucha-like alcohol strength, this one feels akin to rustic, unsweetened lemon soda.
 
Some times call for a beer stripped entirely of alcohol (technically, less than 0.5%). Einbecker’s certified non-alcohol pilsner is easily one of the most convincingly tasty ones out there. Think gentle hop-bite, bready malt character, and clean finish.

=== Title: Drink the Islands: These Mediterranean Wines Are Ideal for Summer - Bloomberg ===

Watching 
, the recent film set on the volcanic island of Pantelleria off the coast of Sicily, set off my recurring summer fantasy: sailing to a remote, sunbaked spot surrounded by a glittering turquoise sea, where I sip chilled local wines overlooking a harbor of gently rocking white yachts.
If, like me, you didn’t make that dream happen this summer, you can let the taste of the best island wines take you to a selection of glam places such as Sardinia, Corsica, Pantelleria, and other fashionable Mediterranean playgrounds.
Many of the native grapes are unfamiliar, with hard to pronounce names (try niellucciu), but don’t worry. The wines, born from grapes grown in volcanic soil and
ripened by luminous sun, salt air, and the mistral wind, are really, really good.
Here’s my summer tour.
 
On this rugged island where Napolean was born, 100 miles off France’s south coast, the rhythm of beach life is appropriately languid.
Right now, New York somms are touting its reds, whites, and rosés—Cedric Nicaise, wine director of Eleven Madison Park, has nearly 100 Corsican wines on his list.
The hottest grape is vermentinu (vermentino), which a British wine writer once dubbed “the yachtsman’s white.” Its bright flavors seem made for drinking on the deck of a sailboat after a swim, and the island’s rosés and reds are equally compelling. All seem to share the fragrant scent of maquis (macchia in Italian), the tangled wild scrub of lavender, rosemary, and aromatic shrubs that cover just about every Mediterranean island.
This high-acid 100 percent vermentino has a refreshing, lime-inflected, salty taste that echoes the sea. The owner of this historic estate south of the Corsican capital, Ajaccio, is known to play Corsican songs to his vines to “keep them happy.”
A fragrant, light red based on sciaccarellu grapes (known as Corsica’s pinot noir), it’s spicy, delicious, and only 11.5 percent alcohol.
Pale orange-y pink in color, with enticing spice and mineral aromas, this mouth-watering blend of sciaccarellu, niellucciu, and grenache has a taste of strawberries and the bite of salted lemons.
 
TheMediterranean’s second biggest island lies far enough off Italy’s coast (200 miles) to have an exotic, otherworldly feel. Its striking, boulder-strewn hills are home to 4 million sheep, in addition to vineyards with gorgeous sea views.
In recent years, the wines have progressed from rustic to refined, but they still capture Sardinia’s wild, untamed character.
As in Corsica, the star white is tangy vermentino, with the best bottles coming from the windswept northeastern region of Gallura. There the grape is planted on granite cliffs that fall dramatically away to the idyllic Costa Smeralda, famed for its sandy beaches and secluded yacht-filled marinas.
With spicy aromas of wild sage, this fresh, crisp white features savory pear and almond flavors. Perfect with calamari salad or oily sardines. 
Fresh and crisp, this delicious value buy from one of the island’s leading estates is notably refreshing, an ideal beach party white.
 
A tiny mountainous island in the Bay of Naples, about 19 miles from the city, Ischia features beach resorts and therapeutic mud baths and is nearly as popular a destination as Capri. Vines grow on steep, terraced slopes overlooking the sea; the most renowned grape is a white native to Ischia, biancolella.
The d’Ambra family specializes in wines from native grapes. This white comes from the stunning Frassitelli vineyard, 2,000 feet above sea level. One part of it is so steep that a monorail trolley brings the grapes down the slope. Bright and golden-colored, it’s savory and juicy, with aromas of fennel and spicy, lemony flavors.
 
Only a handful of Greek islands make exceptional wines that are widely exported. Best known is 
whose striking landscape of black sand beaches and whitewashed cliff houses becomes a crowded tourist scene in summer. Drinking its edgy, earthy assyrtikos on your home deck almost takes you there. Green, mountainous 
whose fine, golden-sand beaches invite barefoot walking, is the most important wine spot among the Ionian islands off the west coast of Greece. And
known to archeology buffs for the famous site of Knossos, sports ultra-luxurious yacht club villas as well as a winemaking tradition that goes back 4,000 years.
A standout white made from organically grown grapes, it’s intensely salty, lemony, and earthy, with a rich, polished texture.
This fresh, light, white Robola, laced with mineral and citrus hints will make you think of grilled fish.
The red liatiko grape is indigenous to Crete. The pure, vibrant, spicy red fruit flavors of this wine recall an easy-sipping Beaujolais. It’s best slightly chilled. 
 
But let’s return to Pantelleria. In 
, there’s plenty of nude sunbathing by the pool as well as lazy drinking of chilled wine. The largest of Sicily’s islands, with wild scrub hugging the rugged rocks, it draws fashionable wealthy Italians such as Giorgio Armani to its dammusi, or local stone cottages.
Its wines, made from dried zibibbo grapes, are luscious sweet dessert wines, powerfully fruity (think apricots and orange peel), with a sultry, seductive texture that sure matches the steamy atmosphere of the film—before it turns into a thriller.
My pick? 2014 
 ($43 a half bottle).

=== Title: Best Rosé Wine Under $25 - Bloomberg ===

Brace yourself. Rosé season starts this weekend. The 
 means pale and pretty wines will be poured at patio parties everywhere to jumpstart a hopefully decadent summer lifestyle. An oversize tub filled with ice and bottles of pink wine is now de rigueur for entertaining.  
So what to put in it? Rosés from Provence have been in vogue for what seems like forever—
 of nearly 6.9 million bottles were imported into the U.S. last year—and alas, the 
 is exploding. But you don’t have to pay a lot to get something you'll be happy to drink. If you’re having a party or just want to knock back a glass by the pool, the virtues of those expensive rosés—ability to age, complexity—are beside the point.
In taste testing nearly 150 rosés to come up with my list below, I was dismayed by how many of my past French favorites no longer cost less than $25.
My advice is to get adventurous and expand your taste buds. If you still think only Provence rosé is worth drinking, you’re wrong (though I included several). Other regions in France, Italy, Spain, Austria, and, above all, the U.S. are making super interesting pink wine with plenty of personality.
 
With only 11.6 percent alcohol, this pale, crisp, spicy blend of syrah, grenache, mourvedre, and counoise is ideal for afternoon sipping. (It comes in magnums, too.)
I've long been a fan of this fresh, bright, light-bodied rosé from one of California's pioneers of the gamy grape. This vintage is all tart berries with mineral depth.
Always pushing boundaries, pony-tailed winemaker Christopher Tracy makes several unusual rosés, including a
 in the Hamptons. This one is pale, delicate, and mouthwatering.
The taste of wild strawberries and the scent of roses mark this cool-climate pink wine from the cool Sonoma coast; the colorful label looks great on a picnic table.
Yes, this southern-France-style rosé is hard to get; it’s from a tiny winery in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. But it may change your mind about the state’s wines.
 
Bright, bright pink, this delicious tempranillo-based rosé from high-elevation vineyards is light and floral, with notes of red berries.
 
Monks own this historic castle in Kamptal. It’s known for it superb rieslings but also produces this pale peachy-pink, juicy rosé from zweigelt and St. Laurent grapes.
 
Beaujolais is still underrated, especially when it comes to rosé. Super refreshing, light and floral-scented, this one is made from gamay and goes with just about everything.
A star organic estate in the Loire Valley, Baudry is noted for reds, but its very dry pink wine from cabernet franc is loaded with subtle elegance and minerality.
Sancerre is better known for its whites, but top producers like this one make wonderfully complex, elegant pink wines with stony overtones.
This is the second vintage for this Provence rosé made by the daughter of Rhône wine legend Michel Chapoutier. Pure and light, it has surprising flavor intensity.
Bright salmon pink, this intense wine with layers of fruit and minerals comes from a special “terroir” subappellation that was established 10 years ago. Picasso once lived nearby.
This large estate, one of the most famous in Provence, specializes in red wine but also makes three rosés. This one is the midprice classic style, floral, light, gulpable.
 
This traditional Italian rosato from a region near Lake Garda is fresh and bright, with flavors of licorice and violets. (Chiaretto is the local name for rosé.)
Ruby pink and full-bodied, this rich, savory wine with herbal and earthy notes is almost like a light red. Cerasuolo is the name for rosés from this region in central Italy.
 
Mt. Etna is one of Italy’s buzziest wine regions. This orangey-pink, lavender-scented wine made from local grape nerello mascalese reflects the mineral character of the region’s terroir. 
 
One of the push-the-envelope winemakers in South Africa’s Swartland, Adi Badenhorst offers amazing bang for the buck with this plump, mouth-filling wine.   

=== Title: Icy Desserts Are Hot This Summer - Bloomberg ===

Washington School House started life in 1889 as—you guessed it—a schoolhouse. Today, it’s a 12-room boutique hotel with a guests-only restaurant specializing in American standards, including a sweet blackberry granita made with local honey, fruit, and mint picked from the garden. Bonus: Enjoy the tart treat while lounging at the property’s hillside-perched pool. 
; 
 alum Leah Cohen took a traditional dessert from the Philippines (her mother’s home) and made it her own. She starts her 
 with shaved ice, then adds flan, shredded coconut, and caramelized plantains. A scoop of purple-yam ice cream crowns the dish, which she then drowns in a mixture of condensed and evaporated milks and garnishes with toasted crispy rice. “It tastes like an adult bowl of cereal,” Cohen says. $8; 
This spot features a rotating menu of frozen slushees based on the 
, a Mexican shaved-ice dessert. Marin’s current iteration combines the smokiness of mezcal and the sweetness of fresh mango purée, plus a bit of heat from ginger liqueur and house-made Sriracha salt. The cocktail is strained over hand-shaved ice into an elegant coupe glass. 
The bourbon cabinet served here blends Evan Williams 100-proof bourbon, syrup from Luxardo cherries, and vanilla ice cream. (No ice, per se, but who really cares?) The inspiration for this adult milkshake comes from the classic Manhattan. “Cocktail bars can often take themselves a little too seriously,” says managing partner and bartender Sean Maher. “These help keep the atmosphere fun and relaxed.” 
Chef Nicolas Abello serves a piña colada-inspired palate cleanser before dessert that he says offers “an interplay of tropical spices with classic French cuisine.” The bottom layer is an intense rum gelée; Abello tops that with a roasted pineapple smoothie and finishes it with coconut-milk granita and kaffir lime zest. 
Pastry chef Ben Spungin introduced pineapple crushed ice with burnt-cinnamon-stick ice cream to the “secret menu”—usually reserved for locals and regulars—in May. He roasts cinnamon sticks for his ice cream in a wood-burning oven. Then he juices pineapples and combines the liquid with lime, sugar, and water, freezes it in sheet pans, and scrapes it into a slush. The acidic, refreshing, sweet pineapple cuts through the richness of the ice cream, which is perfumed with a drizzle of tarragon oil made from local organic herbs. 
 
 An Italian shaved-ice dessert that can be flavored with anything from fruit or herbs to coffee. Its name derives from granite, referring to its grainy texture.
 This means “mix-mix” in Tagalog, one of the official languages of the Philippines. It’s traditionally served with condensed milk, tapioca, sweet beans, and corn, and garnished with a slice of flan and a scoop of purple-yam ice cream.
 Most Latin American countries have a version of shaved ice. This Mexican variety is typically sold by street vendors, who scrape ice by hand and top it with ingredients like flavored syrups, fruit, chili powder, and lime.
 A Rhode Island milkshake, sensibly named for the place you store your blender.

=== Title: The Doughnut Store of Your Dreams Is Blossoming in Central New Jersey - Bloomberg ===

You might not have heard of Aki Kamozawa and Alex Talbot, the cooks behind the brainy, brilliant blog, 
, but they are vital resources for chefs all over the country. Chefs pay $1,000 a day to learn about the finer points of hydrocolloids, oven humidity control, smoking, or any of a number of topics Kamozawa and Talbot have tackled over the last decade. Among certain chefs, the two are superstars.
The couple met as cooks in the late '90s while working in the kitchen at Clio in Boston, and they have since co-written 
 packed with techniques that make you think differently about cooking—such as this 
 for steaks, or this neat method for 
. In the last year, they’ve been to restaurants in Boston, Milwaukee, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York to lead workshops and troubleshoot techniques with chefs. Last weekend, however, Kamozawa and Talbot finally took a break from consulting to open their own place. It’s a hundred-foot-wide stall in Stockton, N.J., a tiny doughnut and frozen custard shop aptly named 
.
Eager to learn what they knew about doughnuts, I drove to 
, a food hall in the Victorian center of Stockton, where Talbot was running back and forth, from the counter to the market’s communal kitchen, in a frenzy of rolling, frying, and glazing.
The yeasted dough, Talbot explained as he rolled some out and cut the rings, was not unlike the super-buttery doughnut recipe he and Kamozawa had published in 
But a month of experimentation had helped them come up with some tweaks. First, there was now more yeast in the recipe, which meant it could come together in just two hours instead of 18. And they were using buttermilk, vanilla, and heavy cream to modify the flavors. “I’m a buttermilk fanatic,” Talbot said later, over the phone, when he explained that buttermilk features in their cake doughnut recipe as well. (The unyeasted doughnuts.)
The doughnut is one of those fried foods from which I don’t expect serious crunch; they offer mostly tenderness, weightlessness, and a disappearing sort of sweetness. But in the fryer oil, the surface of some of the yeasted doughnuts splits just a little, forming ridges that get lovely and crisp as they cook.
While I'm there, Talbot gets word that the chocolate-glazed doughnuts are running low, so he coats half the batch before him with chocolate and dredges the rest in a cinnamon sugar spiked with the tiniest bit of cardamom. I try one. It is the greatest cinnamon doughnut I’ve ever tasted, partly because it’s still warm from the fryer and partly because the edges have just a touch of crispness, a very delicate layer that gives immediately to a rush of buttery, tender, slightly bouncy interior.
For a few minutes, I don’t talk at all. This doughnut is too delicious. Finally, I ask Talbot what, in his opinion, makes a perfect doughnut. I expect some kind of nerdy, science-driven answer, some kind of ratio of fat to flour—precision, numbers, techniques.
“A perfect doughnut makes you happy,” Talbot answered, carrying a sheet pan full of warm doughnuts to the counter. While this is probably one of the corniest things ever said about doughnuts, it may be the truest.
Kamozawa and Talbot never seem to run out of good ideas or settle on a single way or doing things. Mistakes and disasters of all sizes tend to show them the way to something new. For example, when the doughnut robot they had enlisted to fry the cake doughnuts broke on their opening weekend, they piped them by hand into long, fat cigars. Which is now the official shape of their cake doughnuts. And instead of throwing out scraps, Talbot is currently rolling plain and chocolate scraps together, turning them into beautiful, marbled rings. 
The Curiosity Doughnut menu this weekend will have a couple of fresh additions, including a baked 
 made with rice flour, topped with a crunchy rice streusel. Because I think baked doughnuts are just delusional cakes, I'm much more excited about the new apple pie doughnut, filled with applesauce made from apples that Kamozawa picked in New Hampshire and glazed with butterscotch. A tip for anyone heading over: You can and should ask for it a la mode, so you don't miss out on a taste of their buttermilk-vanilla frozen custard. It will make you happy.
 

=== Title: Make This Now: Beer Ice Cream Sundae From Little Park - Bloomberg ===

After demolishing an ice cream sundae at Andrew Carmellini’s latest New York restaurant, Little Park (
), my only regret was that I shared it with a friend. The beer ice cream, which tasted of malty chocolate and coffee, was drizzled with a translucent sour-vanilla-caramel sauce, then finished with a sprinkling of crispy puffed bulgur. It was a symphony of contrasts: hot and cold, smooth and crunchy, sweet and bitter.
It was bliss.
Jennifer Luk, Little Park’s professorial pastry chef, offered to feed my ice cream habit and show me how the sundae comes together. I squeezed in next to Luk in the cramped basement kitchen, which at 8 o’clock in the morning was already bustling with excitement. Over the drone of the Imperia pasta maker and a mallet pounding tuna into carpaccio, I struggled to hear.
The dish, Luk explained, came from an unlikely source of inspiration: wintry nights at Smith College, where she dipped tortilla chips into applesauce and washed it down with beer.
“At first, beer tasted like dirty socks. But as I got older, I started to appreciate its bitterness,” Luk said. Now she enjoys combining salty, sweet, and sour to balance bitter in her desserts. She does this in part by serving her beer sundae with a scoop of apple sorbet and garnishing it with thinly sliced apples. But I was more interested in the malty flavor of the beer ice cream and the sweet, salty, and slightly sour bulgur and caramel.
Luk adapted the ice cream base from one published online at 
in 2012. It uses heavy cream instead of whole milk and yolks instead of whole eggs to create a rich base that can withstand less viscous beer. But don’t use heavy cream that contains stabilizers, such as carrageenan. “They wreak havoc on ice cream,” Luk said as she broke the eggs, one against the other and into a large bowl. One by one, she pulled each yolk from the whites and transferred them to another bowl.
She then suggested buying only pasteurized, not ultrapasteurized, cream. Ultrapasteurized, which has been heated at a high temperature, often tastes cooked and loses its natural whipping power.
The frenetic glimpse into Luk's morning routine was well worth the trip. Her ice cream is a beer lover’s dream dessert—malty mocha with a burst of brewed tang to finish.
But selecting the beer proved the trickiest part of adapting this recipe for the home kitchen. Luk uses Renaissance Elemental Porter Ale from New Zealand, but it can be hard to find in retail shops. She recommends a porter or stout with hints of chocolate, malt, coffee, and berry. The flavors intensify with cooking, so avoid beers with notes of licorice, spice, and hops (hops become bitter when simmered). Since alcohol doesn’t freeze easily, choose one with a low ABV (alcohol by volume), ideally around 6 percent. I had great success with Left Hand Brewing Company’s Milk Stout.
For me, the dessert’s showstopper is the final topping of puffed bulgur—a cereal made from the hulled kernel of wheat, usually durum. My extensive ice cream experience has seen cacao nibs, caramel popcorn, and toffee substitute for the M&M’s and sprinkles on the sundaes of my youth, but bulgur was genuinely new. Luk got the idea from a colleague, who was munching on what looked like Kashi cereal. It turned out to be fried bulgur, which Little Park's sous chef had picked up earlier, in the kitchen at Eleven Madison Park. Luk tried it and knew it was destined for the top of a sundae.
Just before serving the dessert at Little Park, Luk drops dried bulgur into hot oil until it puffs up, then tosses it in a sweet-and-sour mixture of maple syrup and Balconville’s apple vinegar, and more salt than you thought was kosher. If you can’t find the apple vinegar, which is closer to a balsamic glaze than cider vinegar, Luk suggests using boiled cider instead. I think an aged balsamic would also work well. The puffed bulgur is everything Luk strives for in her desserts—sweet, salty, sour—and plays well with the slight bitterness of the ice cream.
For big kids like me, I’m delighted that sundaes have finally grown up.
Serves 6 to 8
Active time: 1½ hours
Total time: 5 hours
¾ vanilla bean
2 cups heavy cream
6 large egg yolks
¾ cup minus 1 teaspoon sugar (150 grams) 
½ teaspoon fine sea salt
12 ounces porter ale (about 6 percent ABV, with notes of chocolate, coffee, malt, and 
 licorice or spice)
¾ cup dried coarse bulgur wheat
Kosher salt
1½ cups water
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 tablespoons apple vinegar, such as 
 (substitute boiled cider or aged balsamic)
About 2½ cups vegetable oil, for frying
¼ vanilla bean
½ cup sugar         
1 tablespoon, plus 1½ teaspoons apple vinegar, divided
¼ cup water
2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
¼ cup, plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream, divided
2 tablespoons crème fraîche 
¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
1. Make the beer ice cream: Fill a large bowl with ice water. Have a medium bowl that fits into the ice water bath on hand, as well as a fine-meshed sieve; set aside.
2. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape its seeds into a medium saucepan. Add the split vanilla bean and heavy cream and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking the vanilla seeds into the cream; remove from heat.
3. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, sugar, and salt together until combined and lighter in color. (It should be about the color of lemon curd.)
4. While whisking, slowly pour half of the hot cream into the egg mixture to warm it, then whisk it back into the saucepan. Set the saucepan over medium-low heat and stir constantly in a figure-eight pattern until the custard coats the back of a wooden spoon, 8 to 13 minutes. (The bubbles along the pan’s edge will disappear when the custard is done.) Immediately strain the mixture through the sieve and into the medium bowl. Set it over the ice bath to cool completely.
5. Place 5 ounces (2/3 cup, once the froth settles) of beer in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Gently boil over medium-high heat until reduced by half, 3 to 6 minutes. Refrigerate until cool.
6. Whisk together the cooled beer reduction and custard, along with the remaining 7 ounces (scant 1 cup) of beer. Process it in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer’s instructions. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, at least 6 hours. It will keep frozen for as long as 5 days.
7. Prepare the bulgur topping: Preheat the oven to 200F or have a dehydrator on hand.
8. Rinse bulgur until water runs clear; strain through a fine-meshed sieve.
9. In a medium saucepan, bring the bulgur, a pinch of salt, and water to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat until most of the water has evaporated, 15 to 20 minutes. Test the bulgur to make sure it’s done, adding more water and simmering longer if needed.
10. Spread the cooked bulgur on a large baking sheet and set in the oven, stirring it or crumbling it in your hands once hardened every 30 minutes until void of moisture, about 4 hours. (Or, dry bulgur using a dehydrator.) Dried, unfried bulgur will keep for about two weeks in a sealed container.
11. In a medium bowl, combine the maple syrup and apple vinegar; set aside.
12. Fill a medium saucepan with oil and bring it to 400F. Turn the heat to low and carefully lower ¼ cup of the dried bulgur into the oil. Fry until puffed and golden, about 30 seconds. Using a small sieve or slotted spoon, transfer the bulgur from the oil to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with the remaining dried bulgur; set aside.
13. Prepare the caramel: Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the seeds into a small saucepan. Add the sugar, split vanilla bean, 1 tablespoon of the apple vinegar, and ¼ cup of water and whisk over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Raise the heat to medium-high and boil, without stirring, until dark amber, about 10 minutes. (Dip the whisk into the caramel, and use the color on the whisk as a guideline, not the color in the pot.)
14. Turn off the heat and whisk in the cold butter, a few pieces at a time. (Be careful when adding butter, as the caramel can bubble.) Whisk in ¼ cup of the heavy cream, then chill.
15. Once cool, whisk in the crème fraîche, salt, 1 tablespoon of remaining heavy cream, and the remaining 1½ teaspoons of apple vinegar. Season to taste with more salt and vinegar as needed.
16. To serve: Toss the puffed fried bulgur in the maple-apple mixture. Sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of kosher salt and toss again. Taste, adding more salt as needed (you should be able to taste the salt).
17. Scoop ½ cup of ice cream into each bowl. Top with 1 to 2 tablespoons of caramel and ¼ cup of glazed-puffed bulgur.

=== Title: Japanese Whisky Is Growing Scarce; Here Are New Brands to Stock Up On - Bloomberg ===

At Union Square Wines & Spirits, one of the best stocked shops in New York, wine director Jesse Salazar has a problem: His customers want Japanese whisky—and he can’t get his hands on new bottles right now. In frustration, he even tweeted 
 of an invoice: “Item not available,” it reads, straight down the line.
“We tried to place an order for Japanese whisky,” he says, but it was impossible to get it filled. “Anything older than 12 years old has become something of a unicorn.”
Over the past year, demand for Japan’s luscious, silky whisky has “completely exploded” among Western drinkers, Salazar says. In particular, interest picked up after critic Jim Murray proclaimed a single malt from the Yamazaki distillery “the best in the world,” in November 2014. Of course, that bottling immediately flew off the shelves, and prices spiked.
“It’s not quite Pappy crazy, but it’s headed in that direction,” Salazar predicts, referring to Pappy Van Winkle, one of the 
 labels.
In fact, it seems that Western drinkers have started consuming so much Japanese whisky that even the biggest producers have been forced to make adjustments to avoid running out of supply. For example, Beam Suntory and Nikka are pulling back some or all of their popular age-statement whiskies and replacing them with non-age-statement products, which can be rolled out faster to thirsty buyers.
In June, Suntory unveiled Hibiki Japanese Harmony ($65), a blend of malt and grain whiskies that tastes strikingly similar to the Hibiki 12-year-old bottling, with a delicate mix of honey and stone fruit, but the Harmony carries no age statement. Although the popular Hibiki 12 hasn’t been officially sunsetted, don’t hold your breath trying to find it. “Hibiki Japanese Harmony will now be our central focus,” a representative from Beam Suntory confirms, alongside Hibiki 17 ($150) and Hibiki 21 ($250).
Similarly, Anchor Distilling, Nikka’s U.S. importer, has taken an even more draconian approach, driven by “remarkable demand” and efforts “to maintain stocks and balance the needs of long maturation periods.” Nikka’s aged single malts (Yoichi 15-year-old, Miyagikyo 12-year-old, and Taketsuru 17- and 21-year-olds) are now available in the U.S. on a limited allocation basis, while the Nikka Coffey Grain ($70) as well as a new non-age-statement whisky, Taketsuru Pure Malt ($70), will remain “readily” available. Nikka expects to release additional non-age-statement whiskies in 2016 as well.
This is not to imply that these bottlings aren’t any good—the Coffey Grain is light and easy-sipping; the Miyagikyo 12-year-old, with its delicate balance of smoke, white flowers, and honey-sweet fruit, is just stunning. And once the bottles currently on the shelves are depleted, Miyagikyo will become near-impossible to get.
The timing couldn’t be better to learn that three more Japanese whisky producers have quietly started to release bottlings to the U.S. All three are smaller distilleries with relatively limited output, and many of these likely will sell out quickly. But these whiskies are spectacular, and some are destined to become cult objects, worth snapping up for holiday gift lists while you still can. A quick guide to the new kids in town:
 This tiny distillery was left in disrepair after Japan’s whisky market collapsed in the 1990s. Owner Ichiro Akuto rescued the crumbling operation, along with 400 casks of old stock that had languished for decades (Akuto calls them “my children”), and reopened Chichibu in 2008. Look for 
($200), a sweet-and-spicy blend of three- to five-year-old whiskies (a five-year-old single malt is “on the way,” get it?), as well as 
($250), a deliberately smoky beast that Akuto likens to Scotland’s super-peated Ardbeg and Laphroaig.
Named for Kichiro Iwai, “the silent pioneer of Japan whisky,” the 
($37) and
 ($65) bottlings are fruity and complex. Note: A previous release, Mars Maltage, won “
” at the 2013 World Whiskies Awards, so these will attract some attention for sure.
One of the smallest distilleries in Japan, located near Kobe, makes its mark with unusual finishes, letting the whisky rest in former bourbon, sherry, wine, and even shochu barrels. The end results are bold, luxe, and bourbon-y whiskies. Look for two releases: 
($47), a blended, lightly peated whisky; and 
($70), a stellar sipper with a whiff of campfire smoke.
These are the bottles to grab right now, along with the vanishing age-statement whiskies from Nikka and Suntory. (A note on those going-soon bottles: They’re already scarce in the New York metro area, but it may still be possible to find bottles elsewhere in the country. “Sometimes when I visit my family, I’ll drive up and down the West Coast picking up older inventory,” Union Square’s Salazar confides.)
Meanwhile, you may have an easier time securing a dram than a full bottle; it’s not unusual for bars and restaurants to get their allocations ahead of retailers, Salazar says. For those seeking a running head start, the newly opened 
 is offering Ichiro’s “On The Way” at $18 for a 1-ounce pour. Smart drinkers will be exploiting that loophole until the bottle is tapped.

=== Title: Winemakers Warn of a Coming Burgundy ‘Apocalypse’ - Bloomberg ===

Rain, floods, and hailstorms have decimated vineyards since 2010, especially in the Côte de Beaune (the southern part of the famous limestone strip that’s home to the most famous vineyards). Growers invested in 
, but, alas, they haven’t worked. 
The chardonnay grape harvest was down 30 percent in 2013, pinot noir as much as 50 percent. In 2014, which had some of the worst weather in recent memory, some winemakers lost 90 percent of their crop; 2016 is already looking to be worse, weatherwise. This means the remaining grapes are much more expensive, and businesses that depend on making wines from them will be forced to pay a premium they increasingly can’t afford.
“Growers essentially say, pay what we ask, or we’ll sell to someone else,” says Blair Pethel, one of the growing number of "micro-negociants"— small domaines who buy grapes from growers to turn into wine rather than owning their own vines. Grapes to make his 300 bottles of 2009 grand cru Charmes-Chambertin cost €8,000 ($8,800); the price for the same amount in 2015 was €22,500. He didn’t buy.
David Croix, of Domaine des Croix, says that his cost for Meursault grapes is double what it was in 2011, but the price for the wine that he makes from them is only 15 percent higher.
Even small domaines that own their vines are hurting. As Alex Gambal of Maison Alex Gambal puts it, “Imagine that over six years, you have the equivalent of no income for three of them, yet have the same costs.”
It’s hard to see how this situation is sustainable, especially since the worst frost since 1981 swept across Burgundy in April; 2016’s potential harvest may be down 40 percent. At the same time, global demand for Burgundy is skyrocketing. That 
The world’s well-heeled wine lovers are chasing the premiers and grands crus from the 20 famous names (your Romanée-Conti, Roumier, Rousseau, and Roulot). Prices have risen so fast, some domaine owners are no longer sure what to charge, especially because merchants and restaurants mark them up way, way more.
Can Burgundy prices keep rising? Or will the bubble burst? Will wine lovers rebel and look elsewhere for their pinot noir and chardonnay?
These questions are giving owners of small domaines, such as Pethel of Domaine Dublère, sleepless nights. Though they’re paying higher prices for grapes, such vinters as Croix and Pethel don’t have superstar status, so there’s a limit to what they can charge for their wines before buyers start saying "no way." That squeeze is why Pethel fears a Burgundy “apocalypse” of small players shutting down or a dramatic price crash.
Wine lovers, including me, have bemoaned Burgundy’s rising prices for a decade. Bottles I could buy for $30 three years ago cost $70 or $80 today, while those from the 32 grand cru vineyards in the region have become trophies for 1-percenters. Just one example:
he 2103 La Romanée from Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair is nearly $3,000 a bottle.
“It’s a question of scarcity—short harvests (2012, 2013, 2014) or less crop than expected (2010, 2011, 2015),” explains Jasper Morris, the Burgundy buyer for U.K. merchant Berry Bros. & Rudd.
“Some growers may be greedy, but mostly they’re trying to stay afloat.” 
Despite weather problems, there are good wines in all the past five vintages: 2010 is excellent for reds and whites; 2011 is a definite notch down, with light, fruity, and charming wines; the best 2012s are rich and luscious, while complicated 2013 produced juicy, pure reds and whites for drinking now. In 2014, whites are the stars. The 2015s look stunning, but prices will be very high.
Merchants see all this as a perfect storm.
In the U.S., David Kunicki, a vice president of importer and distributor Martin Scott Wines, worries that savvy American buyers may not be willing to keep paying high prices. “Now,” Kunicki says, “I’m looking for value.” In London, some merchants buy only Burgundies they
. Sebastian Thomas, of London’s Howard Ripley Wines, warns,
“There are a lot of midrange Burgundies from recent vintages stuck in the pipeline. If customers see wines increase by over 100 percent in three years, they vote with their feet
, and the pound dropping against the euro, they will be more expensive than ever.) 
So what’s the answer for a Burgundy lover?
Buy strategically. Go for basic Bourgogne rouge and blanc from famous names, and buy village level Burgundies, especially those labeled vieilles vignes (old vines), and less expensive premiers crus from small negociants such as those in my list below. Other good up-and-coming producers include Chantereves, Sylvain Pataille, and David Moreau.
For Americans, the strong dollar against the euro helps—at least for now.
  
 
In the shadow of Puligny-Montrachet, the Saint-Aubin appellation is on an upward quality track. This premier cru white is savory and mineral-tinged.
Star winemaker Pierre Morey formed his small negociant company to make reasonably priced wines. This one is crisp and savory, with plenty of character for the price.
With subtle aromas and a silky texture, this spicy premier cru red has berry-like grace notes.
 

=== Title: Why the Japanese Love Chilean Wine - Bloomberg ===

Some places you go, you drink like a local out of principle. Bourbon in Kentucky. Caipirinhas in Rio. A Guinness (or three) in Dublin. But the locals may have their own, more interesting ideas about what they drink. It could be a fad
remember "
," when an animal on the label was a guarantee of success—or simply a longstanding preference that only history can try to explain. Here are a few unexpected preferences from around the world.
The winemakers in this northern region of Italy are known for their Barolos, Barberas, and Barbarescos—robust, full-bodied wines with pronounced tannins. But outside their own vineyards, you’re just as likely to find a bottle of Champagne when you stop by. Wine importer David Weitzenhoffer of 
says that it was the Piedmontese winemakers who introduced him to the Champagnes that eventually filled his portfolio. He suggests that historical connections to France may be the reason for the region’s regard for French bubbles as opposed to domestic Prosecco or Franciacorta. Or maybe game recognize game.

Pretty much every country loves big, powerful red wines, but no one seems to love Italian Amarone, specifically, as much as the Swedes. Instead of just picking the grapes and fermenting them, Amarone producers dry the grapes on straw mats to concentrate the flavors and sugars; the process takes what would otherwise be a light style, Valpolicella, into a drink that’s headier than other big reds, such as Priorat or Châteauneuf-du-Pape. At 16 percent alcohol, Amarone wines are strong, richly flavored, and sometimes a bit sweet, all of which appeals to the typical Swedish wine drinker, according to Frida Hansson, head sommelier at 
 in Stockholm.

As if the French didn’t have enough of their own wine to drink, they manage to be the world’s best market for Port wines as well, consuming almost twice as much as the No. 2 country, the Netherlands. Tawny and white Ports are popular throughout France as a chilled aperitif, says Andre Compeyre, wine director at the 
in New York, who was twice named France’s top authority on the Portuguese wine. French fortified wines, such as Maury and Banyuls, are usually drunk at the end of the meal.

Originally developed by the Dutch and the English, "un gin tonic" is one of the most popular drinks in Spain, where locals and bartenders endlessly riff on one of the simplest of cocktails. “At virtually every bar there’s an array of beautiful gin and tonics served in large vessels with unique assortments of botanicals, herbs, citrus, and fruit,” says John Stanton, head bartender at 
 in Chicago. He says the drinks, served in balloon-shaped glasses, rely on precisely matching each gin with a complementary tonic and evolve over time as they sit in the glass. Lower in alcohol than Spanish brandy (or a martini), they’re well-suited to the warm Spanish climate.

Fernet and Coke is pretty much the first alcoholic drink of every Argentine youth, according to Laura Catena, managing director of 
 in Mendoza. The bitter, aromatic spirit came over with a huge wave of Italian immigration around the turn of the 20th century. Catena says her great-grandfather and grandfather both drank the herbal liqueur after dinner, on ice, without the coke. It is gaining ground among bartenders in the U.S., nowhere more so than in San Francisco, which accounts for 35 percent of all the Fernet Branca consumed in the U.S.

While Chilean wine has slipped in popularity the U.S. and U.K., its two biggest markets, the country’s red wines are booming in the country that sits at No. 3, Japan—in 2014, exports to that country were up almost 18 percent. The reasons are prosaic but telling: Chile and Japan’s trade is up in general. Winemaker Felipe Tosso, of
, says Chile exports not just wine but copper, fruit, and fish. Turns out the Japan-Chile Economic Partnership Agreement, passed in 2007, may have been a turning point for wine. Apparently if Chilean fish is good enough for sushi, their wines are good enough to accompany it.

=== Title: Americano Cocktail Recipe - Bloomberg ===

Invented in the late 1860s in Milan by Gaspare Campari—creator of the namesake Italian bitter—this refreshing cocktail has been in vogue among aficionados ever since American expats fleeing Prohibition discovered it in Italy during the 1920s It’s likely that their enthusiasm for the concoction ended up giving the drink its modern name. By the mid-20th century, the Americano was popular enough that even that discerning cad James Bond took a liking to the aperitif—it’s the first drink he ever orders, in Ian Fleming’s 
.
Masa Urushido, bar manager at New York’s 
, credits the cocktail’s success to its effervescent texture and beguiling interplay of bitter and sweet notes. “The spirits complement each other,” he said. “The sweet vermouth softens the Campari and makes it more palatable, then you add the carbonation, which brings out even more taste and aroma. It’s just a great, traditional cocktail that everyone loves.” And with its tall, rosy blush complexion, the Americano even looks good and makes for a chic accessory in warm-weather wedding attire.
Thanks to its low alcohol content—especially when compared with its boozier cousin, the Negroni, roughly equal parts gin, Campari and sweet vermouth—the Americano especially lends itself to day-drinking, whether on the beach or at a streetside Milanese café.
1oz Campari
1oz sweet vermouth
soda water
1 orange slice (cut in a wheel shape)
Fill a Collins glass to the top with cubed ice, add the Campari and sweet vermouth, then top off with soda water. Stir, add a straw, and garnish with half an orange wheel. Urushido recommends Martini-Rossi for the vermouth and Perrier for the bubbles.

=== Title: Applejack Is Serious Now: Best New Bottles, Cocktail Recipes - Bloomberg ===

Dear hooch industry: You can keep your sickly sweet “apple pie-flavored” moonshines, nasty neon green “apple” liqueurs that bear zero resemblance to a tart Granny Smith, and ersatz “apple spice” whiskies that have probably never been within 100 feet of an orchard.
Finally, we have a crop of spirits worthy of Johnny Appleseed that are (shocker) actually made from apples—no air quotes needed.
Pegging it to the 
 and craft distilling boom in general, some in the booze industry are even placing bets that aged apple brandies are poised to fill demand for brown spirits should rumblings of 
, 
, and 
 shortages come to head.
“People realize they can distill with whatever they have their hands on,” says Daniel Pucci, cider director at New York’s 
. For many regions in the U.S., particularly New York state, Virginia, and pockets of the Pacific Northwest, that means local apples in abundance.
Applejack is widely considered America’s oldest spirit, dating back to orchards first planted in the 1600s. It’s this traditional style of apple brandy that offers some of the most exciting bottlings on the market right now.
Historically the spirit was made from cider that was fermented and then sat outside in winter; thirsty colonists would later drill a hole and extract the liquid from the center of the cider that was too high-proof to freeze. That method of “freeze distillation,” or “jacking,” is no longer permitted by U.S. regulators, but its high-proof, concentrated flavor profile still has fans.
For years, the category was pretty much locked up by New Jersey producer Laird’s—a respected producer of apple booze that’s been in the business since the 1700s—but a handful of producers from New York’s Hudson Valley, including 
 and 
, are now giving that standard a run for its money. The latter’s new single-barrel applejack, released in December, is particularly astonishing, like baked fruit in a glass, drizzled with rich caramel.
Jeremy Kidde, co-owner of Black Dirt, which itself is part of a sprawling Warwick Valley winery operation that also makes Doc’s hard ciders, cites single-barrel whiskeys as his inspiration—that is, practicing assiduous micro-experimentation on different apple varieties, proof levels, aging time, and barrel char levels. Bourbon fans may recognize the approach as similar to Buffalo Trace's “Project X” warehouse.
“A few years ago, there were no applejacks on the market,” said marketing exec Elliott Phear, who along with Casey McGrath, teamed up with Kidde to roll out a 
 licensed under line Barking Irons apparel line. “A lot of people are making whiskeys, that’s cool. I thought, here’s a space with a lot of opportunity,” he said of applejack. The distillate is made upstate by Black Dirt and then aged at Brooklyn’s Van Brunt Distillery. A limited run of 400 cases was made in 2015; a second batch will be released in spring 2016.
While rough-and-tumble applejack may appeal to bourbon drinkers, a growing number of elegant, fruit-forward apple brandies are likely to appeal to connoisseurs of Calvados, the apple brandy made in Normandy that rivals Cognac’s famous grape brandy for complexity and deliciousness.
As Wassail’s Pucci explains, applejack is often aged in American oak, typically former bourbon barrels, which adds intense vanilla and caramel flavor. Apple brandy is typically is aged in more neutral French oak, which mellows the spirit while allowing the fruit to shine through.
For example, 
, made in Alameda, Calif., has delicate apple and pear notes overlaid with just a hint of butterscotch, and an appealing lightness on the palate. Another California producer, Mendocino’s 
, has a cult following for its rich, complex Heirloom Apple Brandy, made in small batches on an antique copper still using such obscure varietals as Black Twig, Ribston Pippin, and Wickson.
Across the country, a newer New York entrant, Port Chester's 
, is making a clear eau-de-vie-like spirit with a blend of local apples. The bottles hit liquor store shelves in 2015, and it’s available on Wassail’s brandy list, too.
Although the majority of apple spirits are brandy, noteworthy outliers exist. For example, Harvest and 
 both have lightly sweet, apple-based vodkas. The latter also makes a citrusy Half Moon Orchard Gin using an apple-and-wheat base (though there’s nothing much apple-y about the taste). Negroni drinkers may look to Vermont’s 
, a rosy, herb-infused “aperitif cider” that mimics the appearance and flavor of Campari.
But perhaps the most interesting new entrant is Wigle’s Walkabout, an apple whiskey from Pennsylvania craft producer 
. Chatham University Food Studies graduate students developed the product—a blend of hard cider made from several types of apples (Jonathan Gold, McIntosh, SweeTango, Gala, Ginger Gold, Cortland, and Honeycrisp) with a four-grain whiskey (39 percent winter wheat, 26 percent Wapsie Valley corn, 19 percent rye, and 16 percent malted barley)—as part of a product development course taught by Wigle co-owner Meredith Grelli.
“There’s a lot of shame in the whiskey category,” says Grelli, which has taken on some of the worst unbounded-in-nature attributes of flavored vodkas. (Ahem, Fireball.) “We said, let’s come up with a flavored whiskey we’ll be proud to drink.”
Inspired by the legend of Johnny Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed), who scattered apple seeds around the U.S. in a bid to grow fruit trees 
, this is the second year that Wigle has produced its limited-edition Walkabout label. It tends to sell out quickly. Luckily, more products may be on the way.
“We’re exploring more apple ferments and ciders,” Grelli says. “We are looking at it in every form—ciders, brandies, whiskey—every iteration. You can do combinations. This is something that America could put its stamp on.”
That is, if people drink it. We recommend you start with the following bottles and cocktails below.
 
Warming maple and oaky vanilla, with a hit of clove and cinnamon heat on the finish. It's 100 proof; try it mixed with grenadine and citrus in a Jack Rose or in other cocktails. 
This limited-edition bottling has rounded notes of baked apple and caramel accented with apricot and sherry. It’s 50 proof, so cool it with a cube of ice. Can’t snag a bottle? Try the standard-issue, bottled-in-bond applejack instead. 
Fresh and pretty, fragrant with honey and pear and palate-coating vanilla. Each bottle is made with more than 60 pounds of Hudson Valley apples. Sip or mix. 
This unaged brandy is clear in the glass and offers a crisp, clean expression of apple—although some will miss the layer of vanilla that barrel aging provides. 
This copper penny-hued spirit mixes cranberry-like tart notes with toffee and a mildly herbaceous finish with a flick of black pepper. Limited availability.

¼ ounce simple syrup
3/4 ounce red wine
Cut a slit in a lemon wedge and run it halfway around the rim of a Nick & Nora glass to moisten it. Roll the moistened edge of the glass in sugar. Set the glass in the freezer to chill.
In a cocktail shaker, combine remaining ingredients except red wine. Add ice and shake vigorously. Strain into prepared glass. Hold a spoon over the top of the drink, rounded side up, and gently pour the red wine over the spoon to “float” it on top of the drink.
1 large ripe strawberry
2 ounces Barking Irons Applejack
1 ounce ginger-infused simple syrup
1 ounce fresh lime juice
Soda water
In a cocktail shaker, muddle the strawberry. Add the next three ingredients and a handful of ice. Shake well and strain into a tall glass filled with ice. Top off with soda water. Garnish with a lime slice and candied ginger speared on a toothpick.

=== Title: Spiced Rums That Aren’t Gross: Five Best New Bottles - Bloomberg ===

Typically, the autumn and winter months belong to whiskey or brandy, not sunny, tropical rum. But spiced rum may be the exception, carrying the same brown sugar and baking spice profile typical of pumpkin spice lattes or holiday gingerbread.
Right now, rum makers are bringing an ocean of new spiced rums to market—and they’re a lot better and more diverse than ever before. Once derided as too sweet, fit for little besides mixing with Coke, spiced rum has progressed to the newest crop, whose flavors range from subtle (showing nutmeg, ginger, and orange peel) to dark and dangerous (punched up with coffee bean, clove, and campfire smoke). These rums lend themselves to more sophisticated cocktails. Many are even good enough to sip straight.
Ironically, it's the rum-soaked tiki resurgence that has helped reacquaint consumers and bartenders with the spiced stuff, despite the spirit not being part of classic tiki drinks.
“Spiced rum is a sort of a spirit analogue to all of these syrups that are in tiki,” says Garret Richard, bartender at 
 and 
 in New York. In other words, it adds sparks of allspice or cinnamon without sweetness. For smaller bars that may not have the bandwidth to whip up a batch of, say, falernum (a clove-spiked almond syrup called for in many tropical drinks), a good-quality spiced rum “is like a gateway to getting into the flavors” without the fuss.
Spiced rum is a relatively new product for U.S. tipplers. Traditionally, Caribbean islanders would make spiced rums at home with whatever was locally available (think nutmeg, vanilla, allspice, and honey as a sweetener), perhaps selling some at local grog shops or, as in Haiti, on the street. Only a handful were brought to the U.S.—most notably Captain Morgan, introduced here in 1983 and credited with creating the spiced rum category. (“Captain & Coke” still remains a popular drink call at bars across the country.) For decades, Captain was the only game in town, with a sweet, distinctly vanilla-forward flavor profile.
But within the past few years, a drier style of rum became preferred, embodied in bottlings such as Sailor Jerry, Cruzan, Kraken, and most notably Chairman’s Reserve, which features brisk citrus and baking spice, and a whole lot less vanilla sweetness. Made in St. Lucia and introduced to the U.S. market in 2010, it quickly became a bartender favorite. Even Captain Morgan couldn’t help but take note, releasing a series of less sweet, cask-finished bottlings (Captain Morgan Black Spiced Rum, 2012; Captain Morgan Sherry Oak Finish, 2013; Captain Morgan 1671 Commemorative, 2014) intended for an upscale audience.
Now the next generation of spiced rum seems to be returning to its traditional Caribbean roots, as producers take a page from the craft spirits playbook, using unusual techniques or ingredients like local sugar cane or distinctive flavorings.
“It’s like gin,” says Richard, “where you want to be able to tap into the different botanicals.”
Consider, for example, Old New Orleans Cajun Spice: distilled from Louisiana molasses and accented with a spicy, near savory one-two punch of cayenne pepper and clove. Elsewhere, Trinidad’s Stolen Coffee and Cigarettes almost reads like a blackstrap rum; it’s aged in former bourbon barrels for two years and infused with Colombian coffee beans and Madagascar vanilla and other spices, yielding a bold toffee-coffee-chocolate base.
And then there's Siesta Key, made by Florida’s Drum Circle Distilling. In addition to a traditional spiced rum, the producer also makes a “Distiller’s Reserve” 
 aged version—a 
 and blending that involves a pyramid of barrels (youngest rum on top, oldest rum at the bottom) and perpetual blending with each new batch. Drum Circle founder/CEO/head distiller Troy Roberts first produces a silver rum, then infuses it with honey and spices, which are filtered out before the rum goes into the barrel. “Grinds of fine powder” deliberately remain, allowing the spice flavors to mellow over years, then the rum is filtered again before bottling, yielding a mellow, butterscotch-y sipper.
All that trouble for a spiced rum? Surely it’s a sign the category has matured.
“In rum, there was a split,” Roberts says. “There have always been good aged or sipping rums. But when it came to flavored or spiced rums, they were more like the mass-produced beers. They were the cheapest,” often artificially colored, flavored, and sweetened. “I was surprised how few were using actual spices,” he notes.
That’s not necessarily so anymore. Now the balance of quality has shifted, he says, particularly among smaller producers, who are starting with quality rum, plus plenty of spice. “People are slowly willing to pay a bit more for a quality spiced rum,” Roberts says.
The sign of a good spiced rum? It’s enjoyable enough to sip straight (as in all the bottlings listed below), but also blends seamlessly into mixed drinks—including the perfect cold-weather drink, the hot toddy. “Spiced rum is one of the easiest ways to get a toddy really complex fast, without the work,” Richard says. “Apple cider, butter, and hot water is all you need.”
This classic hits the right balance between sweet and spiced, with ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and plenty of orange peel. 
The bold toffee-coffee-chocolate base is accented by dark spices like clove, black pepper, and nutmeg and interwoven with a whiff of campfire-like smoke. Inspired by Jim Jarmusch’s short film series 
 Mix or sip over a large ice cube, like whiskey. 
The base is made from Louisiana molasses, infused with a fiery mix of cayenne pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and clove. Ideal for swizzled drinks with plenty of ice. 
: Marketed as a shooter and clearly gunning for the Fireball flavored-whiskey crowd, this new spiced rum almost reads like a liqueur: viscous and sweet, with orange peel, allspice, and fiery cinnamon. Packaged in a novelty bottle shaped like a cannonball (round, heavy, ridiculously difficult to hold and pour), and yet, it's not bad at all. 
 
 Made from 100 percent Florida sugar cane and flavored with honey and spices, for a butterscotch, maple-y profile sprinkled with cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Not too sweet and ideal for mixing into cocktails. 

=== Title: Japanese Whisky Boom Drives Rice Farmers to Drink - Bloomberg ===

Japan’s burgeoning whisky business is driving rice farmer Hiroshi Tsubouchi to hit the booze.
With domestic rice consumption sliding, Tsubouchi, 36, says he’s getting on the whisky bandwagon -- or, at least, switching to the barley used to make it. With Japanese whiskies ranking among the best -- and most expensive -- in the world, the profits of the local distillery industry are beginning to flow to the country’s farmers.
Tsubouchi will reap his first crop next month, joining a dozen farmers in central Japan testing barley’s potential to bolster incomes and help feed the nation’s malt-hungry spirit-makers. Japan is the world’s 
 of the grain and second-biggest buyer of malt, the barley product that’s mashed and fermented to make whisky and beer. Imports of whisky-making malt jumped 20 percent last year and have almost quadrupled over the past decade, spurred by demand for Japanese whiskies from 
 to Hong Kong.
“I never expected our Japanese whiskies to be so popular overseas,” said Ichiro Akuto, 50, whose single malts sell for as much as 100,000 yen ($920) a bottle. His distillery, Venture Whisky Ltd., in Chichibu in Saitama prefecture, is working with local farmers to establish a supply chain for a malting plant he built in 2013. “I want to produce whisky with the flavor of Chichibu -- something I believe would be admired around the world.”
Akuto has already gained that level of recognition -- winning awards every year from 2007 to 2012. In 
 for 2015, 
, a single malt made by Tokyo-based 
, was named “World Whisky of the Year,” while 
’s Nikka Taketsuru 17 Years won the “World’s Best Blended Malt” title at the World Whiskies Awards last year.
That’s propelled the popularity of Japanese whiskies, leading to shortages and surging prices. While global sales volumes from all producing countries increased an average of 5 percent a year from 2009 to 2014, they advanced at a 5.6 percent clip in Japan, data from Euromonitor International show. While most Japanese whisky is consumed domestically, last year the country sold a record 10.4 billion yen ($95 million) of it abroad, an eleven-fold increase over the past decade.
“Two years ago, if you searched online for Japanese whisky in Hong Kong, you wouldn’t find anything,” said Aaron Chan, who collects the amber liquid and sells it in Club Qing, a bar he owns in the city. “Now in Chinese or English, you see interviews, articles on new whisky bars or PR statements about it. Japanese whisky is definitely getting more and more exposure.”
Even the 12-year-old Yamazaki whisky that Chan considers “entry-level” is difficult to find and, where it is available, it goes for HK$1,200 ($155) a bottle, compared with a recommended price in Japan equivalent to about HK$700. 
A bottle of 1960 Karuizawa sold for HK$918,750 at Bonhams in Hong Kong last August, setting an 
 for a Japanese whisky. One of only 41 bottles ever made, and after being aged 52 years in casks, the Karuizawa is considered the holy grail of Japanese whiskies by collectors.
Whisky supplies have become so tight that Suntory Holdings President Takeshi Niinami has asked his staff to follow his lead and try abstaining from the company’s premium malts. The need to conserve sales inventory trumps the executive’s desire to consume it himself, Niinami told reporters in January. “Hibiki is my favorite, but I can’t,” he said.
Suntory, the country’s biggest distiller, will spend 5 billion yen in 2016 to expand production, adding to the 7 billion yen spent on expansions since 2010, said spokeswoman Hasumi Ozawa.
Whisky maker Akuto, who worked at Suntory until 1995 as a salesman, expects shipments from his Chichibu distillery to increase by 20 percent a year. Last year, he sold 100,000 bottles -- a third of which went overseas to customers mostly in the U.K., France, the U.S. and Taiwan.
Increasing whisky production has been a boon for U.K. farmers, whose barley has become the backbone of Japanese distilling operations. Japanese malt imports totaled 4,744 tons last year, worth about 437 million yen.
Akuto’s Venture Whisky imported 152 tons from England, Scotland and Germany last year. That reliance will lessen if his plan to source malt locally works.
He wants to replace 10 percent of the distillery’s grain requirement with barley grown by farmers in Chichibu. Even if it costs five times more to produce malt from locally grown barley than to import it, changing the source may improve the perception of the quality of the whisky, Akuto said.
Japanese whisky is a subject of “increasing 
, due to rising international recognition and a TV dramatization of the life of Masataka Taketsuru, a pioneer in Japanese whisky distilling,” Euromonitor said in a report in October.
Also, farmers in Chichibu may be able to double their income by planting barley straight after they have harvested rice or buckwheat -- the grain used to make soba noodles. Farmland typically stays idle for six months after the rice and buckwheat harvest in November, a window that barley could fill in a crop-rotation program, says rice farmer Tsubouchi.
A restaurateur who began growing rice in 2011, Tsubouchi says barley may eventually be more lucrative than rice, consumption of which has been declining by about 80,000 tons a year in Japan, tracking the country’s shrinking 
.
“I feel very proud of becoming a supplier to a whisky-maker,” Tsubouchi said in an interview. He bought and rented 0.6 hectares (1.5 acres) of uncultivated land from nearby farms to grow barley for Venture Whisky. He’s planting Golden Melon, a malting-barley variety recommended by Saitama agriculture authorities, who preserved the seed after farmers grew it successfully in the prefecture four decades ago. 
If all goes to plan, 1.2 tons of grain will be harvested in May, Akuto said. That will be used in his Chichibu malting plant -- a 20 million-yen facility that has the capacity to produce 50 tons of malt a year.
“I am the happiest person in the world as my whisky is not only giving people a lot of pleasure, it is also creating a new industry here and reinvigorating farming,” he said.

=== Title: New York Michelin Stars 2016: Restaurant Guide - Bloomberg ===

Europe's largest tiremaker,

=== Title: Salty Dog Cocktail Recipe: The Perfect Drink for Sweltering Days - Bloomberg ===

In the early 1960s, a Massachusetts company called Ocean Spray orchestrated a marketing push to make American consumers think of cranberries beyond the Thanksgiving dinner table. That led to the creation of a drink known as the Cape Codder (vodka, cranberry juice), which in turn birthed a whole genre of waspy cocktails, including the Madras (vodka, cranberry juice, orange juice), the Bay Breeze (vodka, cranberry juice, pineapple juice), the Sea Breeze (vodka, cranberry juice, grapefruit juice), and the Greyhound (vodka, grapefruit juice).
Which brings us to the Salty Dog, a classic tipple distinguished from the Greyhound by virtue of its salted rim, and that functions as the perfect liquid antidote to climbing temperatures.
Don’t let the modest ingredient list fool you: This is a drink that belongs in every home bartender’s repertoire. A cousin of the “New England highballs” described above (hat tip to cocktail authority and author Gaz Regan for the term), the Salty Dog is the kind of cocktail you can whip up in the midst of the inevitable summer multitasking—while you’re making guacamole or steering the boat with the other hand, or when it's simply too damn hot to do anything more complicated. It has a sturdy, everyman appeal, a counterpoint to today’s often overwrought "mixology." (Regan recalls making them in 1980s NYC heyday for both “secretaries at the U.N. and CEOs of major corporations.”)
Like cranberry juice, grapefruit juice is naturally endowed with the balanced attributes that most cocktails strive to replicate with multiple ingredients: tang, tart, and sweetness. Vodka (or gin) supplies the heat, ice cools it down, and salt furnishes a lip-smacking, briny bite.
2 oz vodka or gin
4 oz grapefruit juice
Kosher salt
Moisten the rim of a highball or rocks glass and press onto a plate of coarse salt. Add ice, vodka, grapefruit juice and stir.

=== Title: Best Suede Loafers for Men - Bloomberg ===

Now that temperatures are getting warmer and the weather less wet, suede should be on your mind. (And on your feet.) Step into spring in one of these five suede loafers:
Light colors become more appropriate with warmer weather, and they come as a nice change after one has worn dark dress shoes for so many months. This shade of gray is bright but muted, enhancing the look of the suede and making it appear even softer. The family-owned Italian brand Gravati has been around for over 100 years, and it has mastered the arts of fit and construction. ($625, 
)
 
Tod's driver shoes sport a timeless design and are available in wide range of colors and leathers, but we strongly urge you to pick this color because it is neutral and can be worn with many different outfits. And the rubber pebble outsole makes it a comfortable shoe for trekking through the urban jungle. ($475, 
)
 
Penny loafers with a heel are often best paired with a suit or slacks and a blazer, but these Ermenegildo Zegna brown suede loafers look excellent dressed down, as with a pair of tailored jeans and a polo. ($695, 
)
 
These suede Jack Erwin loafers are handcrafted in Spain, so the quality is top notch, even though the price is low. ($95, 
)
 
Navy penny loafers are an essential for any wardrobe. If you're a newbie to suede loafers, these lightweight and elegant crafted shoes by O'Keeffe make an excellent first. ($510, 
) 

=== Title: Cocktail Carts in Restaurants Daniel, Gunshow, Carbone - Bloomberg ===

Don’t try to order a martini from 
’s cocktail cart. At New York’s famed temple to French cuisine, the custom-built dark wood and marble-topped trolley is used to assemble a single drink—the Castellammarese Rye—right at your table.
The show is impossible to miss.
Gliding alongside the cheese cart and the dessert cart, the mobile cocktail station wheels up to its appointed table. There the bartender pours Punt e Mes vermouth spiked with apricot liqueur and coffee syrup from a curved, cut-glass decanter, then adds a second pour of Rittenhouse rye. Instead of a traditional stir, the drink is rotated within a vintage cocktail shaker that resembles an enormous bell. It’s then poured into a dainty blue-and-white demitasse cup (a reference to the Prohibition years, when cocktails often were hidden in plain sight in tea cups), a little scroll with the cocktail’s history is unfurled, and a refill is presented in a “creamer” pitcher on the side.
For high-end restaurants, this may be the future of cocktail service. Just as bars are trying to become speedier and more efficient (e.g. pre-batching drinks to pull within seconds from draft lines for the thirsty hordes), many restaurants are redirecting the focus to service and slowing the cocktail experience to a more deliberate pace.
Back in 2012, at the height of 
-inspired bar cart fever, Leo Robitschek debuted a particularly sleek, custom black-and-gold lacquered cart, since retired, at the NoMad Hotel. The bar director likened it to a more genteel take on bottle service. Daniel cites it as an inspiration.
“Tableside service is quite prominent in French-style service, whether it’s bread or carvings or flambés,” explains Karim Guedouar, Daniel’s service director. The restaurant’s 
 (pressed duck) is already legendary: a press is wheeled into the dining room to extract the 
 from the duck carcass
 (If that seems like a lot of extra traffic, you’re right: the restaurant actually removed four tables from the dining room to accommodate the flow of all the carts.)
The goal is to deliver an experience, not just a drink. It’s also a way to direct attention to the bar, which often plays second fiddle to the wine list.
“We want to make sure our guests know there is truly a bar and lounge at Daniel,” Guedouar says. “The bar cart is the best way to do that.”
The showmanship also drives sales.
Approximately 10 to 15 tableside drinks are ordered each night at Daniel, or about 75 in a week, says Guedouar. People see the show, and tend to order one for themselves. That zest trickles into sales of other drinks made at the bar, too. “It’s contagious in the dining room.”
The carts often mirror the aesthetic of the dining room. Consider, for example, the masculine 
 at Bourbon Steak in L.A., and the 
 at Atlanta’s Gunshow, which has garnered attention for dispensing with the bar altogether, opting to make 
 of its drinks at the table.
Roving Bloody Mary carts also are a popular brunch option, spotted at 
 in West Hollywood, in which guests are encouraged to load up their eye-openers with all sorts of edible accouterments. Wolfgang Puck’s 
 carts around Tequila Manhattans (yep, tequila instead of whiskey).
Carts are often a way to highlight a prized spirits selection or collection—including prized bottles not available at the regular bar. 
 New York brings rare Cognacs and Armagnacs to the table, often making a show of serving them using a long-handled 
similar to the ones used to extract the liquid from the barrels in France. Meanwhile, 
 rolls out a vintage rum cart tableside, a bid by chef Mario Carbone to share his personal passion for pairing vintage rums and cigars.
Daniel, however, may be the only restaurant to narrow their tableside cocktail down to a single drink. But once patrons have indulged, how to ensure that the cocktail orders will continue to flow during future visits? The answer: change up the drink every few months; the Castellammarese Rye will bid 
 in May.
“Now that we have the cart,” Guedouar says, “we want to keep the ball rolling.”

=== Title: New Wave of Sommelier Clubs Will Change How You Experience Wine - Bloomberg ===

Ian Cauble looks more like a surfer than a master sommelier, but his passion is definitely wine. He starred in the 2012 cult-hit film 
 which tracked the trials and tribulations of four sommeliers in their quest to pass the tough master sommelier exam. (Cauble was the blond one who stayed up all night studying his flashcards.)
A year and a half ago he co-founded wine club SommSelect, and when I reached him recently by phone, he was heading to Burgundy to pry older vintages out of top cellars for his members. His club, which has swollen to 2,000 regular buyers, offers monthly selections of exciting top-tier wines for $199—and is just one of the rapidly growing number of hip wine clubs “curated” by sommeliers.
To me, these subscription organizations are game-changers, the only wine clubs worth joining, whether you love discovering interesting wines but have little time to hunt them down or you just want to expand your palate beyond your current comfort zone. (See below for my picks of the best ones.)
Why? The cutting-edge, high-quality wines they offer are often hidden-gem labels that are hard to obtain without insider access.
Most wine clubs still offer plonk—bulk reds and whites jazzily repackaged with a catchy name for the club or blends created with particular flavor profiles and price points in mind. While these may appeal to novices, they’re not for serious drinkers.
(Winery wine clubs are something different. If you’re a fan of particular estates and want the chance to purchase their special cuvées and older vintages, it makes sense to join.)
Somm clubs are the adventurous alternative. Yes, they adhere to the basic club model, where you pay a set price for a certain number of wines delivered direct to your door each month or quarter.
But some also offer daily deals and bespoke options so you can get sets of bottles tailored to your taste preferences and entertaining needs. Plus, the wines come with tasting notes, food pairings, and stories, all of which reflect the personal taste and style of the somm doing the selecting.
Don’t, however, expect deep discounts. These clubs are not inexpensive, and you have to add in tax and shipping.
Here’s a selection of my favorites.
 
Cauble and his partner Brandon Carneiro started in 2014 with a daily e-mailed wine offer—such as the two-bottle pack of 1992 Olga Raffault Chinon at $100 that sold out in 22 minutes. Buyers kept asking the duo to send them a set of those picks every month, and the wine club was born. European wines account for 70 percent to 80 percent of their choices.
The two options of six wines, the Somm 6 and the Blind 6, cost $199 per month. If you decide you don’t want to continue, you can opt out at any time. I worked my way through the Blind 6, which come numbered and wrapped in black tissue paper, so you can taste blind and learn to train your palate the way a sommelier does. I was impressed with the choices, which included a bottle of 2010 Dame de Montrose ($60 at retail), the second label of Bordeaux second-growth Château Montrose.
Michelin-starred chef Michael Mina started this club two years ago, and wines are chosen by well-known sommelier Rajat Parr, the Mina restaurant group’s wine director.
There are two options of six bottles each, shipped quarterly: You can join either Hidden Gems ($120) or the snobbily named Wines of Consequence ($300), which has previously included bottles from such hot producers as Sonoma’s Scribe winery and Austria’s Moric. Many labels are on Michael Mina wine lists, and all shipments come with special food recipes created by the restaurant.
This club seems less personal and quirky than the others; it’s a partnership with Global Wine Co., which has its own club.
Brian McClintic (another star in the film 
, and Eric Railsback opened Les Marchands Wine Bar in Santa Barbara, Calif., in 2013. The origin of their wine club was the same story: Customers kept asking where they could get wines like those on the bar’s list.
One of the best of several subscription options is SBC, which will get you two wines a month from Santa Barbara County ($80). They’ll come from both up-and-coming and classic producers, and a recent inclusion was a brilliant 2005 Clendenen Nebbiolo Reserva Punta Exclamitiva. The other is the Grand Cru club, which includes two bottles of Burgundy each month for $249. Recently it featured the silky 2013 J.F. Mugnier Chambolle-Musigny ($125 at retail).
Railsback and McClintic have moved on, but other Les Marchands somms have taken over.
Based in San Diego, this club is run by sommelier Tina Morey, who calls it “a wine subscription service designed to get people excited about less familiar wines.”
Subscribers pay $175 per month or per quarter for a six-bottle collection imaginatively organized around a particular theme.
In March, it will be Après Ski, with wines like light, delicate 2014 Pierre Boniface Les Rocailles Apremont, a white from one of the best producers in Savoie, in the French alps, that’s made from the Jacquere grape. There are also an Italian Valtellina from a region near famous ski destinations and even a top New Hampshire sparkling cider.
After eight years as a sommelier in Los Angeles, Ashley Ragovin launched Pour This last October. The common thread, she says, is that “the wines taste like they’re worth double the price.” Based on the list of her recent offers, I’d say they do. There’s a definite girly sensibility to the website, but don’t let that put you off.
Her club has three “experiences.” The Daily Pour is a single bottle offer e-mailed every day, with varying price points, such as the deliciously savory 2011 Jean-Marc Pillot Chassagne-Montrachet Mes Vieilles Vignes ($42).
The Monthly Pour is $98 a month for three wines on a theme, a spotlighted region, or a producer. In December it was bubbles, with a stellar hard-to-find grower champagne from Pierre Gerbais, a Cava, and a Prosecco.
But I find the Custom Pour, at $140, in which you can shape the choices to your preferences, the most interesting club. Try the one-month option before committing.
A couple of times a week, former sommelier Levi Dalton hosts an hour-long, highly entertaining podcast called “I’ll Drink to That,” in which he interviews a wine world personality. (Full disclosure: I’ve been on the show.)
Last October, he added a wine club, featuring a wine from the winemaker or winery on Tuesday’s show at a 10 percent discount. In episode 337, for example, it was John Lockwood of Enfield Wine Co. in the Napa Valley and his 2013 Haynes Vineyard Syrah ($43.95). (This wine made it onto my list of 
.)
When you join (e-mail: leviopenswine@gmail.com), Dalton asks your price ceiling and how many bottles you want set aside each month. You can ask him to group bottles for shipping to save money.
The next hot club? Brian McClintic is launching his own club, Viticole, in September. It will start with daily offers, with each day of the week representing a different theme. Sunday will always be bubbles; Monday will be $20 and under. Keep an eye out by following 
 on Twitter.

=== Title: Orlebar Brown SnapShorts: $600 Trunks Featuring Your Own Photos - Bloomberg ===

High-end swimwear brand Orlebar Brown has made a splash in recent seasons with OB Editions, a series of men's bathing suits that feature famous photographs of summer scenes. The above, showing a Slim Aarons shot of the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc in the south of France, was a popular pair of trunks last year—and there have been others featuring the work of photographers Per Eriksson, David Hall, and Evan Stringer. 
Or they could bear the work of another important photographer: You.  
Orlebar Brown is now offering a brand new "design your own" service that gives you the opportunity to turn your favorite snaps into luxury swim trunks. The SnapShort 2.0 app will allow anyone to take his favorite Instagram photos onto his very own Orlebar Brown photographic shorts. It doesn't have to be a photo of a beach; you could select a sketch, a pattern you've seen on the way to work, graffiti art, or family memory. Anything you want. Even selfies, because there's nothing more eye-catching than wearing your face in your own lap.  
The app is an update on a prior version of SnapShort, which allowed monthly contest winners to design their own bathing suits. Now anyone can do it, for a price. Depending on the sizing, the trunks start at $595.
The process just takes four simple steps: 
The SnapShort 2.0 app is available to download from the Apple store and Google play and will be available online and in Orlebar Brown stores. (

=== Title: Tom Kerridge New Cook Book, Tom's Table, Targets Home Chefs - Bloomberg ===

Tom Kerridge is a bloke.
He also happens to be a chef whose 
, outside London, is the only pub in the world with two Michelin stars. He is one of the U.K.'s most popular television cooks, known for his down-to-earth style of cooking and communicating.
He likes to speak his mind, even if that sometimes gets him into trouble. He 
 last year with a remark that women might lack the aggression to make it to the top in cooking.
"That was an incredibly clumsy comment," he says. "People say daft things all the time. It’s only when you are in the spotlight that it gets highlighted.
"So it made this worldwide thing that caused the industry to look at itself, which is great because we all have to pay attention and take note. There are chef shortages, irrespective of gender. We need to look at the way we operate so that it is more attractive for people to stay in the industry no matter what their background."
Kerridge has a new book, Tom's Table, whose uncomplicated recipes and style reflect the man himself. Kerridge is warm and friendly. And until he gave up drinking three years ago, he was the life of any party. These days, he's more measured and reflective - though he's still likely to grab you in a bear hug.
The book features 100 familiar recipes that even the most amateur of cooks ought to be able to rustle up at home. Kerridge's theory is that even if you get things wrong, you are likely to pick up a few tips.
"There's nothing I would love more than if in 20 years' time that cookbook is still on someone's shelf in their kitchen, covered in grease and flour and dirt from being used," he says. "It is supposed to be cooked from."

=== Title: Do You Need Wine-Lister, a New 1000-Point Wine Rating System? - Bloomberg ===

Move over Robert Parker. A former Lazard investment banker has created a data-driven fine wine rating system with a wildly ambitious, 1,000-point scale. 
 is now live.
I started out highly dubious that it would be useful in helping wine lovers decide what to buy. The idea of a bottle with a score of 1,000 points seemed like a parody of the 100-point system instituted by Parker, the don of American wine criticism. Even that approach seemed ludicrous to many when first introduced.
Besides, do we really need more wine ratings? For many wine lovers and retailers, the importance of scores has been waning for years—except when it comes to buying Bordeaux and Bordeaux futures.
So I spent a few pre-launch hours perusing Wine-Lister’s site with London-based founder and Chief Executive Officer Ella Lister to discover how Château Haut-Brion, for example, gets to 959 points. What does that mean, exactly, and should anyone care?
I was more impressed than I expected to be, but then I’m a wine geek who’s fascinated by wine data. 
First of all, the Wine-Lister score reflects more than just a subjective assessment of taste and quality, which is all that the system set up by Parker—and those of other critics—aim to do.
Lister (wine-lister, get it?) likes to call her system “multi-criteria.”
“There are many more objective, measurable factors people use in deciding what wines to buy than just taste,” she said. “I wanted to pull together those disparate bits of information and give buyers a more nuanced, 360-degree, holistic view of a wine, all on one page.”
Château Haut-Brion’s basic score is a distillation of layers of data—the wine’s estimated longevity, its popularity in the marketplace, price, performance at auction, quality level, and the global strength of the brand. All of these are factors, Lister argues, that are important to people when considering whether to buy a bottle.
Lister spent four years developing the idea and lining up wine partners, such as 
, which tracks auction data, to help provide information. She has surveyed merchants and restaurant wine lists and worked with technology experts to come up with algorithms to crunch all the myriad parts into each wine’s single overall score.
So far the site tracks some 2,000 wines, but Lister aims to increase it to about 5,000. We’re talking, of course, about fine wine that sells for at least $25 or so, not weekday bottles or party plonk.
It takes time to grasp all the aspects of the site and figure out how to decipher the somewhat confusing graphs.
I tested out the system. Here’s how it works.
Take the page for Bordeaux’s Château Beychevelle, which provides its basic rating of 848, information on where the wine is from, the blend of grapes, and age of the vines (30 years).
Clicking the “Quality” tab shows scores of the three partner critics—Jancis Robinson and her team in the U.K., Antonio Galloni and his team at Vinous in the U.S., and Bettane + Desseauve in France. Since two use the 20-point scale while one uses the 100-point scale, Lister and her technical assistants translated those scores into the 1,000 point system, then worked out an average of all three for the Wine-Lister scale.
For the Beychevelle, the score is 750.
(Though there are no tasting notes, if you have a subscription to one of the three critics’ sites, you can click through to their wine descriptions.) 
Under “Brand,” Beychevelle’s 978 score reflects the wine’s presence in restaurants, its high popularity (based on the number of monthly searches on Wine-Searcher.com), and Lister’s surveys of key merchants worldwide.
Under “Economics,” you’ll find the average price, how much it has increased over the past six months, and whether the wine is frequently traded at auction. All that added up to a score of 915.
Clicking on a vintage such as 2014 gives data for that specific year. The quality rating for 2014, a high of 853, is much better than the one for the 2013 vintage (547!), but both sell for about same price, so 2014 is clearly a much better buy. This is where Wine-Lister really comes in handy.
Among the site’s most useful aspects are its elaborate search functions and being able to hunt for wines according to what most interests you—investment staples, value picks, hidden gems, buzz brands. There were some interesting surprises.
No. 1 on the list of “Investment Staples,” for example, is 2002 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti La Tache, with a score of 991. But Italian icon 2001 Sassicaia, which costs less than a tenth of the price of that La Tache, rates 988. It’s the investment bargain among the top 20 brands on the investment list.
A scan of “Value Picks” turns up the bargain 938-point lush, rich 2010 Castello dei Rampolla Sammarco, a super Tuscan going for only £48 ($69.36) a bottle.
Hidden Gems includes 2009 fruit-and-mineral rich Remelluri Rioja Gran Reserva (£27/$70). It has an extremely high-quality score, but the brand is little known.
You can choose the currency tin which the price will be displayed, but be warned: Some listed U.S. prices are lower than you will find in shops.
So what about that magical 1,000 points? Is this kind of scale really necessary? Lister pointed out that the 100-point ranking used by Parker and many other critics is pretty narrow, with just about all scores ranging from 80 to 100 points.
In case you’re wondering, the top-rated wine on Wine-Lister is Domaine de la Romanée-Conti La Tache, followed by Petrus.
Lister sees the scores as “snapshots,” valuable tools for “anyone and everyone” who buys wine.
I’m not persuaded. It’s a very handy tool for serious collectors. If you’re a wine obsessive who loves data, or a numbers freak, you’ll find plenty to entertain yourself for an hour or two.
But you have to be pretty committed to wine—and buy lots of it—for this site to make sense.
On the other hand, it only costs £90 pounds a year, the price of a decent cru classe, and a 14-day trial is free.

=== Title: White Wines From Southern Italy Are Leading a Revolution - Bloomberg ===

When you think of Italian wine, what comes to mind? Ever-foaming prosecco, perhaps? Tanker ships of pinot grigio? Or maybe it’s big-deal reds from Tuscany and Piemonte, with three-digit price tags attached.
It’s time for a fashion update. The big buzz right now is for whites from southern Italy, the land of still-active volcanoes, sun-drenched beaches, and 80 percent of the country’s olive trees. It’s also where you’ll find off-beat grape varieties few wine geeks have ever heard of. The best of the bottles that are made from these are great wine buys, offering surprising depth and character at bargain prices.
Which is why I moderated a tasting panel on them this month at VINO 2016, an Italian wine conference in New York. (My notes on the top wines are below.)
Compared with Italy’s prosperous north, the south—Campania, Puglia, Calabria, and Sicily—was long the country’s poor cousin, focused on producing bulk red used to plump up thinner wines elsewhere and decidedly rustic whites.
Since the beginning of the 21
 century these regions have been in the throes of a wine renaissance, brought about by scores of talented, passionate winemakers obsessed by the hundreds of enticing but nearly forgotten ancient grape varieties that flourish in Italy.
High-quality reds came first, and the recent spread of cold fermentation technology has radically transformed the whites.
Let’s start in Sicily. If everything you know about wine on this island comes from watching the scene in 
in which pitchers of basic red are passed around and poured into water glasses at a wedding, you’re way behind. Today’s wines are cutting edge.
The hot spot is Mt. Etna. Wines from its steep, volcanic-ash-strewn vineyard slopes are the Italian success story of the past decade.
When I first visited there in 2001, it seemed the most inhospitable wine spot on the planet, shadowed by a brooding 11,000-foot-high volcano that lets out periodic booms and flashes of smoke.
Twisted old vines are rooted in tiny patches of vineyard at 3,000 feet above sea level, edged with piles of lava stones. This stark landscape and the highly distinctive, salty, earthy wines have drawn some of Italy’s most eccentric producers, even seducing a former banker. From about five quality estates, the number has grown to 110. 
Pioneers Andrea Franchetti of Passopisciaro winery and Italian-American wine broker Marco di Grazia of Tenuta delle Terre Nere are the showmen who excited international interest in Etna, while Belgian wine fanatic Frank Cornelissen pursues natural wines that have a cult following. The main grape on Etna is Carricante, and it’s often blended with another Sicilian white, Catarratto.
The late great winemaker Marco di Bartoli, on the other side of the island, put his faith in dry wines made from Grillo, which used to go into sweet Marsala.
Next, you should know about nearby Calabria, often called the “toe” of Italy. Since 90 percent of the land is mountains, the amount of wine produced there is still modest. The wine scene is still evolving, but its output is all about native grapes such as Mantonico.
Puglia, the region known as Italy’s “heel of the boot,” has become a food and travel destination with a long coastline of beaches dotted with thalassotherapy spas. There, the first wines to gain attention were hearty reds from such grapes as Negroamaro, but several wineries, such as Masseria Li Veli (see below) have also recently championed such local whites as Verdeca that have the kind of personality that elbows chardonnay aside.
Campania, whose main city is Naples, is the birthplace of opera and thin-crust pizza and home to another volcano, Vesuvius. And it’s where the wine revival in southern Italy first began some 25 years ago.
Almost half of Campania’s wines are white. Although there are dozens of varieties, Fiano wines from the Avellino subregion and Greco Biancos from the town of Tufo are vying for the top spot. Both grapes were rediscovered by famous wine estate Mastroberardino, which promoted them tirelessly. Today, tiny family wineries, such as Ciro Picariello, are making some of the best examples.
Wines from these grapes were around, admittedly not quite in the same form, when lava flows destroyed Pompeii. Think of them as drinking history.
One of my go-to whites for every day drinking, this wine made from Greco Bianco grapes (planted in ancient times by the Greeks) near the coast in Calabria is round and fruity, with hints of herbs, flowers and toasted nuts.
This crisp, scented white from Puglia tastes of citrus, fresh spices, and chalk. It’s made from Verdeca, an ancient grape once used as the base of inexpensive vermouth, and a tiny bit of almost-extinct Minutolo.
Mantonico is yet another ancient variety introduced by the Greeks. Golden, intense, this medium-bodied, sleek white from Calabria has the texture of a red and flavors of figs and almonds. Best with a thick fish soup.
This savory wine comes from one of the best wine estates in Sicily. Made from the Grillo grape, it has jasmine-like aromas and fresh, delicate, elegant flavors. The winery’s Grappoli di Grillo ($34) is even more layered and intense.
Herbs, fruit, earth, stones, gunflint—the complexity of flavors and scents in this wine are why Etna whites are having a moment. This is one of the most widely available.
This grape was once cultivated on the slopes of another volcano, Mt. Vesuvius. It’s fresh and crisp and full of personality, with ripe pear and lemon flavors
A tiny, family-run winery makes this smoky, round textured wine, one of Campania’s top examples from the Fiano grape, grown in a tiny appellation. It’s intense and mineral-driven, with tastes of pine nuts and herbs.
This was the first winery to research almost extinct Pallagrillo bianco grape. It’s a very unusual wine, with apricot blossom scents, mineral tastes, and a wonderful soft texture. 

=== Title: Mezcal Margarita Recipe and Bottle Buying Guide - Bloomberg ===

Mezcal, tequila’s smokier, sweeter cousin, is having a moment. Exports from Mexico have almost doubled since 2011, with hundreds of varieties available in the U.S., and bars that specialize in the spirit are popping up all over. (Both tequila and mezcal are derived from the agave plant. Tequila is usually manufactured in industrial ovens; mezcal in underground, rock-lined pits.)
Bobby Heugel, owner of Houston mezcal den 
, uses 
 ($34; 212-674-7500), the “benchmark mezcal” for its lower-proof, fruity character. His version of the margarita (recipe below) swaps triple sec with green Chartreuse, a French liqueur that “draws out the herbal and vegetal qualities you find in the agave and mezcal.” Agave nectar lends a natural, rounded sweetness for a beautifully balanced drink.
If you prefer to stick to high-end sipping, find a bottle of 
 ($120; 650-364-8544). It’s got an earthy flavor leavened with hints of baking spices and pine, thanks to a recipe that’s been passed down for generations in Oaxaca’s Sola De Vega region. And you can give an Old Fashioned a bittersweet, peppery kick with one of the latest releases from Wahaka Mezcal, 
 ($300; 
), a rare distillation from the remote Puebla region.
 
Lightly moisten the rim of a glass with a lime wedge, then roll it in salt. Heugel recommends a half-kosher, half-wood-smoked salt blend from Mountain Rose Herbs to accent the spirit’s flavor. Combine remaining ingredients with ice in a shaker, give it a couple of hard shakes, then pour into the glass and top off with fresh ice. Garnish with a lime wedge and a sprig of mint.

=== Title: Best Hawaiian Shirts, from Valentino and Marc Jacobs to Bonobos - Bloomberg ===

Floral shirts are no longer for the tourist getting off a plane from Hawaii. For the past few years, brands have been making the once-lame shirt cool again. When cut well, and when patterned with attractive punches of color, the shirts can provide a welcome alternative to the same polo shirt or pale blue Oxford you've worn summer after summer. 
Don't assume you can't wear this trend until you've looked through the eight shirts below.  
But first, some style tips:
 
Hedi Slimane's last collection for Saint Laurent included palm trees, and tons of them. Here's your chance to own a piece. ($690, 
)
Bonobos has a full line of essentials for men and offers guideshops throughout the U.S. so you can try them on—and still get the items delivered straight to your home. This teal Hawaiian palm shirt comes in two sizes, slim and standard. ($85, 
)
Black and white is an easy way to feel like you are avoiding "too much" print. ($69, 
)
This isn't your traditional floral shirt. Instead, Valentino substituted tulips and roses with your favorite fruit that you never actually eat: pineapples. ($750, 
)
Marc Jacobs is known for making quirky shirts that are actually wearable, like this one. ($660, 
)
This is the perfect "Aloha" shirt. The red feels rich and exciting, and although it's really bright, it works. ($195, 
)
A subdued version of the Hawaiian shirt, such as this one from Club Monaco, is a great way to tiptoe into the trend. ($89.50, 
) 
If you're feeling courageous and want to embrace the theme fully, this number from J.Crew is for you. The pattern is apparent, the mix of colors is bold, and the shirt will make you stick out in the best way possible. ($59.50, 
)

=== Title: Orange Wine Has Finally Arrived. Here Are Eight Bottles to Buy - Bloomberg ===

When high-end, wine-centric restaurant Rouge Tomate reopens next month in New York’s Chelsea district, there will be plenty of “orange” wines on the list.
Traditionally from Georgia in Eastern Europe, these tannic white wines—made like reds, with grape skins left in during fermentation and aging—have been trending for four or five years as 
, touted as the fourth wine color. Have they finally become more than novelties?
“They’re here to stay,” says Rouge Tomate Chelsea wine director Pascaline Lepeltier, who sent me a long list of her favorite producers.
A surprising number of restaurants around the world now seem to agree. When the London Ritz updated its very traditional 800-wine “Livre du Vin” this year, five orange wines, with two by the glass, were among the 150 wines added from obscure locations. That doesn’t sound like much, but it amounts to a lot at a restaurant previously focused on Burgundy and Bordeaux.
As a judge for the 
’s 2016 restaurant wine list awards, I discovered good orange selections not just at hipster wine bars such as 
 (seven) and 10 William Street in Sydney (25), but also at casual restaurants like Montreal’s Lawrence (eight) and new elegant ones like London’s 
 (more than 30). Fig, a James Beard award-winning spot in Charleston, S.C., added an orange wine category a year ago.
There are no market statistics on the number of orange wines now being sold, but dozens of wineries, including Chapel Down in England, have added at least one to their lineups. Lorena Ascencios, head buyer at Astor Wines, says the large New York shop carries more than ever because of increased interest. And Frank Dietrich of importer Blue Danube Wine Co. says his sales of orange wine continue to rise.
The “
” of the wine world has finally happened.
But like me, Lepeltier doesn’t like the term “orange.” She prefers to label them “skin-fermented” wines. (I don’t think that’s going to stick, but I get her point.)
New York’s Gramercy Tavern lumps them together as “Unconventional Whites.” At Frasca, in Boulder, Colo., which won the award for best design/most original wine list, they’re listed as “Macerated Wines.” At New York’s The Clam, they’re labeled “Off-Whites,” not exactly the most flattering description.
Typical whites are pale in color because the clear pressed juice is immediately separated from the grape skins; for orange wines, the juice is kept in contact with the skins for a week to a year, picking up tannin, weight, color, and extra aromas and flavors.
The problem is what to expect when you open one.
Just about any white grape can be made with extended skin contact, but if the juice macerates for more than a year, the wine will be a lot more tannic and have different flavors than if it remains on the skins for only a couple of weeks. Those aged in clay amphorae buried in the earth—the traditional method in Georgia that’s now becoming popular among adventurous winemakers elsewhere—don’t taste like those that spend time in old oak barrels, and so on.
One orange wine can be very different from another, given this whole new layer of complexity outside the typical terroir and aging factors we’re already used to in our reds, whites, and rosés. 
The color can be golden, bright amber, peach, or rust, even brownish; the tastes range from fresh-cut apricots, spice, and herbs to tangy, smoky, nutty, and savory, with more intense aromas and the texture and structure of reds without the heaviness. That’s why they’re awfully good in summer, though they’re definitely not going to make rosé passé.
Making whites this trendy way is an ancient method, first used several thousand years ago in the nation of Georgia. Josko Gravner, the modern godfather of orange wine, brought the idea to Italy and Slovenia, which has been the orange wine epicenter. But the wine world is full of experimenters. Recently I’ve tasted fine examples from Croatia, France, Austria, Australia, California, the Finger Lakes, and Long Island.
A caveat: Some of these wines taste downright weird, with a sour, cidery quality. I’ve watched drinkers take a sip and say, “Oh, how interesting,” before quickly ordering something else. (There is such a thing as showing too much skin.)
But top winemakers make examples that are deliciously complex, even thrilling, and well worth drinking, especially in summer. Here are my eight picks.
Wines from the Republic of Georgia are having a moment, with exports up 44 percent from a year earlier. This winery, founded in 2007 by American painter John Wurdeman, skin-ferments its wines in 
, clay amphorae lined with beeswax and buried. I love this deep gold, spicy one, from the mtsvane grape. It’s crisp, but mouth-filling, with tastes of smoky apricots.
In the Hamptons, former chef Christopher Tracy makes this dry, exotic, spicy white with apricot and honey aromas from pinot grigio grapes. 
 is an Italian term used in Friuli for skin-fermenting the varietal to create a copper-colored wine. This one spent only 14 days on the skins, so it’s a great orange wine introduction. 
A biodynamic winery in Sicily makes this golden orange-hued wine from local grecanico grapes, macerated for seven months in clay amphorae. It has explosive aromas of mint, green tea, and wildflowers, and deep, lemony, earthy, complex flavors. 
This ramato, from grapes grown high in California’s Sierra Foothills and macerated on the skins for one month, is rich and fleshy, and smells and tastes of slightly bitter orange peel and wet stones. (They’ll soon be pouring it by the glass at New York’s Bar Boulud.) 
Packed with flavors of ginger, dried pears, and a smoky mineral note, this copper-colored wine is the first orange wine from star Australian winemaker Vanya Cullen. Made with up to one month of skin contact in amphorae and oak barrels, it’s complex and rich-textured. 
Elisabetta Foradori won fame for her reds in Italy’s steep Dolomite mountains. She ferments this brilliant yellow-gold wine made from nosiola grapes in clay amphorae for eight months. It’s rich and savory, the kind of wine you want with grilled pork. 
Amber-hued, this example from the Montefalco region of Umbria is one of the benchmarks of orange wine, made from trebbiano spoletino grapes left with the skins for at least three weeks. It tastes and smells autumnal, with intense aromas of dried flowers and herbs, and a full, rich texture. 
Josko Gravner made his fame by trading oak barrel aging for fermenting and aging the juice in amphorae that are buried in the earth. On the skins until the spring after harvest, this is riveting: intense, powerful, smoky. 
 

=== Title: This Perfect Fried Chicken Recipe Took 100 Attempts to Develop - Bloomberg ===

On Saturday, the writer and recipe developer J. Kenji López-Alt could be found butchering raw chickens at 
, a bustling retro-style diner on Malcolm X Boulevard. As he broke down the birds, an audience of about 15 crowded in and cheered him on, while others slurped red velvet milkshakes and wondered what all the fuss was about.
It was about fried chicken. López-Alt was preparing to fry some for the day's popup following the method detailed in his new cookbook 
, where a meticulous, 20-page lesson on frying introduces his recipe for Extra-Crunchy Southern Fried Chicken (see recipe below).
New York’s appetite for 
—and fried chicken sandwiches, in particular—seems to be at an all-time high. David Chang’s restaurant group just opened 
 and Fuku+, which specializes in the stuff, while a few Shake Shack locations recently added a fried chicken sandwich to the menu. Over the weekend, the southern chain 
 a three-story, 5,000-square-foot location in Manhattan.
At the comparatively tiny restaurant, Harlem Shake, the chicken was stuffed inside a soft potato roll with plenty of thickly sliced pickled jalapeños and a little smear of mayonnaise. A dribble of hot honey was in there, too (and a squeeze-tube full of it at the table, in case you wanted to add more). It was a simple and excellent sandwich: The fried thigh meat was seasoned right through, with a rugged, crunchy surface that gave way to tender, pleasingly salty meat.
To achieve this, López-Alt explained he’d soaked the meat in salty, paprika-darkened buttermilk, which tenderized the chicken and helped it retain moisture during cooking. He pulled some marinated pieces from the brine and, to build up the crust, dredged the meat in flour he'd mixed up with a little of the same brine. "Oooooh," an audience member cooed, "that's how you do it!" This created tiny lumps that would later, if all went well in the fryer, offer bonus texture and crunch over the surface of each piece. 
“I like to heat the oil to about 425 degrees,” López-Alt shouted over the clatter of the afternoon rush, "because as soon as you add the cold meat, the temperature drops down to 300.” That’s right where you want it for cooking the chicken. At home, López-Alt recommends doing an initial fry and finishing up the chicken on a rack in the oven. The secret to extra crunchy chicken, however, is taking it a step farther: Refrigerate the meat overnight and fry it a second time the next day just before serving.
At Harlem Shake, the narrow open kitchen has no oven, so the meat had been fried once earlier, close to midnight, chilled down, and fried a second time this afternoon. The results were magnificent.
The development of this somewhat labor-intensive chicken technique involved a level of experimentation and attention to detail, fueled by a pure giddy nerdiness, that is often the hallmark of López-Alt’s recipes. He identifies delicious qualities he'd like to amplify—a potato gratin's cheesy crisp topping, a meatloaf's intense savory flavor and moistness—then engineers his recipes to get them every time. López-Alt went through 100 chicken iterations to reach this one.
Like many of the techniques in the book, the fried chicken may seem overwhelming on reading the lead-in, with its frequently asked questions and detailed charts, but it doesn’t actually require expensive equipment or hard-to-procure ingredients. Even a basic recipe for scrambled eggs in the new cookbook will involve a few pages of explanation first. In this case, it's to make the case for salting early and resting the eggs for 15 minutes with the salt, to help prevent weeping later on (that thing where the cooked eggs release a sad little puddle of water). The recipe itself is just a quarter of a page, though, simple and easy to follow, with photos of every step that give beginner cooks visual clues.
López-Alt, who is 35 and lives in San Mateo, Calif., also took his own photographs for the book. He’s an editor and columnist at 
 and a former editor of 
. He grew up in New York eating KFC (and until recently lived just a couple of blocks away from Harlem Shake), then attended MIT and worked for seven years in restaurant kitchens, after which his idea of what makes “perfect” fried chicken changed.
In the introduction to the chicken recipe, López-Alt said he was still after a “deep chicken flavor; a flab-free skin; juicy, tender meat; and crisp, spicy coating.” Mission accomplished. It's no wonder that before the end of the year, Harlem Shake plans to add that fantastic fried chicken sandwich drizzled with hot honey to the menu. In the meantime, if you want a taste, you'll just have to make it yourself. 
 
2 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup buttermilk
1 large egg
Kosher salt
1 whole chicken, about 4 pounds, cut into 10 pieces (or 3 1/2 lbs. bone-in, skin-on breasts, legs, drumsticks, and wings)
1 1⁄2 cups all-purpose flour
1⁄2 cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon baking powder
4 cups vegetable shortening or peanut oil
1. Combine the paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and cayenne in a small bowl and mix thoroughly with a fork.
 2. Whisk the buttermilk, egg, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 tablespoons of the spice mixture in a large bowl. Add the chicken pieces and toss and turn to coat. Transfer the contents of the bowl to a gallon-sized, zipper-lock freezer bag and refrigerate for at least four hours and as long as overnight, flipping the bag occasionally to redistribute the contents and coat the chicken evenly.
 3. Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, 2 teaspoons salt, and the remaining spice mixture in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons of the marinade from the zipper-lock bag and work it into the flour with your fingertips. Remove one piece of chicken from the bag, allowing excess buttermilk to drip off, drop the chicken into the flour mixture, and toss to coat. Continue adding chicken pieces to the flour mixture, one at a time, until they are all in the bowl. Toss the chicken until every piece is thoroughly coated, pressing with your hands to get the flour to adhere in a thick layer.
 4. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the shortening or oil to 425°F in a 12-inch straight-sided cast-iron chicken fryer, or a large wok, over medium-high heat. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature, being careful not to let the fat get any hotter.
5. One piece at a time, transfer the coated chicken to a fine-mesh strainer and shake to remove excess flour. Transfer to a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet. Once all the chicken pieces are coated, place skin side down in the pan. The temperature should drop to 300°F; adjust the heat to maintain the temperature at 300°F for the duration of the cooking. Fry the chicken until it’s a deep golden brown on the first side, about 6 minutes; do not move the chicken or start checking for doneness until it has fried for at least 3 minutes, or you may knock off the coating. Carefully flip the chicken pieces with tongs and cook until the second side is golden brown, about 4 minutes longer.
6. Transfer the chicken to a clean wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 150°F and the legs register 165°F, or about 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the chicken pieces to a second rack or a paper towel-lined plate as they reach their final temperature. Season with salt and serve. (Or, for extra-crunchy fried chicken, go to step 7.)
7. Place the plate of cooked chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, and as long as overnight. When ready to serve, reheat the oil to 400°F. Add the chicken pieces and cook, flipping them once, halfway through cooking, until completely crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet to drain, then serve immediately.

=== Title: Where to Find the Best Cocktails in Dubai - Bloomberg ===

Dubai has some great bars and lounges  - so long as you are happy to drink in hotels and shopping malls, because that's where the licences are.
Cocktails can be very good once you step away from obvious tourist establishments and their sugary concoctions. Just don't expect too much when it comes to wines. Almost everywhere, lists are dominated by overpriced supermarket favorites such as Pinot Grigio and Shiraz. 
Here are some places to try.
This fabulous restaurant and lounge atop the H Hotel is among my favorites. There are great cocktails such as the Hendricks Lemonade for two, served in a teapot with gin for 75 dirhams ($20.42).  It's topped with fresh mint. The bar staff are engaging, the design is  elegant, and the crowd is sophisticated. The website is sadly minimalist but don't be put off.
This rooftop Siddharta Lounge by Buddha Bar at the Grosvenor House is the most glamorous I visited. The views are spectacular, as is the lighting, and this is a good place to chill out on a sofa, with cocktails or a shisha if that is your thing. I didn't try the food - the large menu is Mediterranean - but I did enjoy the cocktails, mostly priced at 65 dirhams.
This speakeasy-style bar and restaurant at the Dubai International Finance Centre is hard to find. That's Prohibition chic for you. There's a cool lounge with a retro look, live music and cocktails such as the Fine Tipple, with sherry, grapefruit & orange sherbet, Maraschino, Champagne. House rules include: "Gentlemen will not introduce themselves to ladies."
Little Black Door is another speakeasy, and again rather hard to find, though it is right off the lobby of the Conrad. Step inside the dark and mysterious room and sip cocktails such as the Not So Colada:  homemade banana & lemongrass-infused rum with coconut water, clarified pineapple juice and eucalyptus (80 dirhams). The quirky playlist features 
.
If you know Zuma in London (or Miami or wherever) you will know what to expect: an extremely lively bar scene, beautiful people, great cocktail list, cool music. Please note that unlike at R Trader, gentlemen are not discouraged from introducing themselves to ladies.
This New Orleans-themed "eatery and social house" is one of the most popular venues in Dubai, though i wasn't especially taken with it. Nola gets jammed at night. If you are not looking for quite such a lively bar scene, it's worth going early for the hapy hour, with some drinks at 50 percent off between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. Nola is also right next door to Cocktail Kitchen (below) so you can make a night of it. 
I love the Ivy in London and feel sad when I see the original decor replicated around the world, including here, where the Dubai outlet sits beneath escalators in a shopping mall. There's a ladies night, a steak night and food & beverage vouchers. It all feels cynical, though I must say the group of English drinkers sitting beside me at the bar sounded like they were enjoying themselves.
This venue in the Dubai International Finance Centre is particularly worth visiting for the happy hour menu, when you can get five pintxos and a drink for 75 dirhams or 10 and a jug of sangria for 200. The snacks, including baby gem, piquillo, anchovy and pulled barbecue chicken slider (served between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.) were a good start to a night on the town.
Right on Dubai Marina, Pier 7 is a building given over to entertainment venues, of which Asia Asia is notable for its Buddha Bar-style lounge and a dining terrace with a fine view. There's a pan-Asian menu, including sushi and dim sum, if you want to eat, or you may just prefer the dark and moody bar and lounge. It was so dark that I had to ask the barman for a flashlight to see the drinks list. My bill tells me I paid 59 dirhams for a "Tiny-Tini" but that's not ringing any bells. It was a long night.
This is the new cocktail bar on the highest floor of the super-luxury Burj Al Arab. There's a resident DJ and weird cocktails such as the Light Sweet Crude, with foie gras and blackened truffle oil. Drinks cost 100 dirhams a pop, which is expensive but not outrageous for a chance to explore this extraordinary hotel. On the night I visited, Gold was quiet and oddly gloomy. Maybe I was unlucky.
This new bar and restaurant at the Armada BlueBay is currently among the hottest in Dubai. The design is clean and uncluttered, the cocktails are carefully made and the food is unfussy. The 
 served on Fridays is particularly popular. But the biggest talking point is the Aperitivo Time happy hour, with cocktails at just 19 dirhams. A barman at another popular spot said he didn't understand how they could manage such low prices.

=== Title: Should You Buy 2014 Burgundy Futures? - Bloomberg ===

“Ah, I love Burgundy,” sighed a twenty-something bearded sommelier behind me at a very crowded tasting of the region’s 2014 vintage last week. Well, me too. Previewing barrel samples of delicious whites and reds from the hottest wine spot on our planet is my idea of a great day.
To cash in on the must-have fervor of Burgundy aficionados, merchants are currently offering futures of the 2014 vintage and I’ve been trolling New York trade tastings in search of good buys. The idea of futures, of course, is to lock in your supply of these wines (which are made in tiny quantities) before they’re bottled and shipped, eventually ending up on retail shelves.
So should you play the game and buy?
Based on exposing my taste buds to a couple of hundred Burgundies over the past couple of weeks, my advice is a definite yes.
Overall, 2014 is a very sexy vintage, with super-drinkable, succulent wines. The whites shine brighter; they’re exciting, energetic, and truly outstanding. The reds exude charm and loads of yummy fruit, especially in the Cote de Nuits. The best have good aging potential, though the reds probably won’t last as long as they would in a great vintage.. (See below for my ten picks, from good values to shameless blowouts.)
The 2014 vintage was yet another year saved from disaster by miraculous September sun (a scenario so common it has become a Burgundy marketing cliché), but the story was much trickier in the Cote de Beaune. At the end of June, a huge hailstorm decimated many vineyards in Volnay, Pommard, Meursault and Beaune for the third year in a row. Then came an infestation of pesky flies. As she poured, Anne Parent of Domaine Parent in Pommard told me with a sigh, “We lost 58 percent of our crop.” This means even tinier amounts than usual, though the best vintners managed to keep the quality fairly high through drastic sorting of grapes.
Maybe when you think of wine futures, you picture Bordeaux, with its yearly hype over the latest “vintage of the century.” Then there’s the two-year wait before bottled wines are delivered, and inevitable collector groans about stratospheric prices.
The Burgundy futures on offer are slightly different—they’re more like pre-arrival reservations. Though reds are still in the barrel, almost all wines will arrive this fall, a boon for the impatient. Since demand usually outstrips supply, the best, rarest, and top values will probably disappear fairly fast. It’s not surprising that Burgundy lovers often suffer from FOMO—fear of missing out.
Price is another reason to snap some up. Good Burgundy is never cheap, but for Americans many 2014s cost the same or even slightly less than the corresponding 2013s (which was an even smaller vintage), partly because of the current beneficial exchange rate with the United States. Prices will be higher if you wait until the bottled wines arrive.) And the 2014s may end up looking like good buys next to the already-hyped 2015s, touted as a great vintage for ripe, rich reds. Echoing the worries of many others, Bernie Sun, a portfolio director at importer Kobrand cracks that the 2015s “will be super-priced.”
But before you plunk down money on expensive ones, check on older vintages. The grand 2014 Dujac Clos St. Denis is $817 a bottle at New York retailer Zachy’s, but you can buy the fabulous 2005 elsewhere for the same money and the very good 2008 for half that.
About two dozen merchants in the U.K. and a handful in the U.S. are offering pre-arrival Burgundies. Why so few U.S. retailers? Blame convoluted U.S. alcohol laws, a holdover from Prohibition. U.K. merchants can purchase allocations direct from the domaine, while many in U.S. cannot and thus don’t always know what they’ll be able to offer. (Prices of all the wines below are significantly lower in the U.K.)
As Charles Curtis, founder of global wine consultancy Wine Alpha, explained, “Buying Bordeaux is a matter of having the money; for Burgundy you have to know the right people.” U.K. merchant Haynes Hanson & Clark pointed out in their recent mailing that “loyal customers will be rewarded with favorable allocations.”
Start developing a cozy relationship with a good merchant right now.
For additional bargains, look for producers like Domaine Hubert Lamy, Jean-Philippe Fichet, and William Fevre, as well as undervalued regions like St.-Aubin and Rully.
Even village level wines, like this one from negociant Maison Jadot, are full of bright mineral elegance.
In the Macon region at the southern end of Burgundy quality is higher than ever. This bright, precise wine from a tiny plot tantalizes with lemon and smoke. The chateau’s Tete de Cru ($30) has some of the same finesse.
Very pure and lemony, with notes of stones and minerals, this rich-textured premier cru is from a producer with one of the largest holdings of premier and grand cru vineyards.
)
Just about everything from this up-and-coming winemaker is good, especially this floral, vibrant white.
Chablis costs way less than other Burgundy grands crus, and this one shows spicy lime aromas and an intense salty minerality. Also look for premier crus from Billaud-Simon, Patrick Piuze, Dauvissat, and Drouhin-Vaudon.
This intense, silky textured red is round and charming, with underlying savor and depth. Also look for the more delicate, less expensive Morey-St.-Denis Vieilles Vignes and
From a hot producer, this grand cru has both lovely, juicy fruit and plenty of richness and depth.
) Ok, it’s really expensive, but this small family domaine is on a hot streak; prices are set to rise. This fleshy-textured premier cru has dark berry flavors, earthy minerality, and outstanding potential for aging. The village Vosne-Romanee ($90) has surprising depth and juiciness.

=== Title: World's Best Wine Lists 2016: Restaurants, Airlines, Hotels, Cruises - Bloomberg ===

Wine has become more important than ever to the world’s eaters, whether in South Africa, China, Peru, or the U.S. That’s my take-away from the 
, which were released Thursday.
This is the third year for British publication 
 annual restaurant wine list awards, which drew more than 4,500 entries from around the globe in 2016. Full disclosure: I was one of the seven senior judges who gave 817 of them one, two, or three stars. Guided by expertise rather than an official checklist, each judge picked his or her top three in each category, ranking them 1, 2, or 3 (the best). The numbers were tallied, and the lists with the most points won. The informal criteria that guided our assessments included diversity, quality of the wines, depth of vintages, and an individual stamp that marked the list as original and different in some way. 
The number honored with three stars was 322 (up from 300 in 2015), and restaurants in 35 countries, including Taiwan, had at least one winner. 
The overall global winner is 
 at Hotel Lisboa, with its panoramic view of Macau, where you can sip one of 16,400 labels under its sparkly crystal chandelier and glass dome while dining on three-Michelin-starred contemporary French. Robuchon beat out Vienna’s grand 
, the best European list, and New York’s 
, 2015’s top award winner and the top list in North America (not to mention the 
).
Though a New York restaurant didn’t take the best of the best honors,
, the Big Apple still cleaned up, with 46 lists in the top three-star category, not really 
much of a surprise to those of us who live there. London, in the runner-up spot, was way behind with only 22.
New this year was a category of five Winner’s Awards of top lists chosen by 2015’s global winner, Eleven Madison Park in New York. Chef Daniel Humm and wine director Cedric Nicaise picked five with star quality. 
Only nine restaurants, including Robuchon, won the judges’ Best in the World awards. Here they are: 
Robuchon au Dôme at Hotel Lisboa
Macau
This is a "wow" list that impresses with its depth of producers, vintages, regions, styles. Its more than 16,400 labels include all the greatest wines in the world, from Jacques Selosse single vineyard champagnes to 17 vintages of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti’s great white, Montrachet, to page after page of the best red Burgundy and Bordeaux. Want to try 1921 Château Petrus? It’s here, for only HK$550,000.00 ($70,870). 
 
Pix Pâtisserie
Portland, Ore.
Modestly decorated with bare wood tables, a long bar, and red-flocked wallpaper, this wine bar wins for a third year in a row for its monumental collection of Champagnes. Despite plenty of competition, no other list equaled its selection of 250 top-grower Champagnes, from Savart, to Selosse, to rare special-club bottlings. Prices are incredibly low, with dozens of in-demand names for less than $150 a bottle. 
 
Robuchon au Dôme at Hotel Lisboa
Macau
For wine lovers who crave sweet German rieslings, I can’t imagine a better restaurant destination on the planet. (There are 27 pages of rare eisweins!) But this is no one-note location: Every top sauternes is here, with vintages of Château d’Yquem back to 1825, and such surprises as Philip Togni’s Ca Togni from the Napa Valley. This is where to spend your casino winnings. 
Rockpool Bar & Grill
Sydney, Australia
Though many restaurants have upped the quality of their wines-by-the-glass lists, this one wins for its amazing diversity, high quality, and helpful descriptive notes.  It includes many unusual ones I longed to try, such as Australian producer Schmolzer & Brown’s Pret-a-Rosé made from sangiovese and pinot noir. 
 
 
Terroir Tribeca
New York City
Paul Grieco’s innovative downtown spot repeats its 2015 victory for its edgy selection that always tells you where the wine world is going next, as well as philosophical comments on wine and taste by Grieco. Just looking at the jazzy design and reading the list is entertainment, with comments by California Zinfandel maker Larry Turley, dubbed the “Master Blaster.” Expect the unexpected—and a long list of great riesling. 
 
 
The Barn at Blackberry Farm
Walland, Tenn.
This is one of those soothing, relaxing places to stay, where your only anxiety being what to order from this list of stellar wines from around the world. But what stands out as the real treat here is the focus on hard-to-find small producers from California. Want to compare eight vintages of Williams Selyem’s Rochioli Riverblock pinot noir or 14 of Dunn cabernet? You can. 
Charlie Bird
New York City
The list at this trendy downtown spot reads like a New York hipster sommelier’s dream selection, all packed into fewer than 150 names.  They range from Cedric Bouchard’s savory Blanc de Noirs champagne, to wine insider favorite Kalin Cellars 1995 Chardonnay Cuvee W, to a great bottle of traditionalist Barolo from Bartolo Mascarello. 
 
 
Formento’s
Chicago
There are plenty of surprises to discover on this 450-label list, including a section of wines made from historic California vineyards, another showcasing wines made from one famous Napa Valley vineyard by different winemakers, and one with 50 wines for less than $50. But europhiles needn’t worry: There’s also a great selection of Italian wines. 
 
Frasca Food & Wine
Boulder, Colo.
Frasca wins again this year for its elegant, modern design and clever, innovative organization. Both make this list easy to read and easy to choose a bottle you’ll probably like. The mastermind behind it is master sommelier Bobby Stuckey, who offers a stellar mix of unusual, exotic wines and great classics, all for reasonable prices. 
 
 
 Emirates
Airlines, too, are competing for passengers by offering more imaginative wine choices. Emirates stands out for the length of its list as well as excellent selections in both business and first class, and for its program of route specific wines. Flights to Australia and New Zealand, for example, pour the juicy, sophisticated Burn Cottage Pinot Noir from Central Otago in first class. 
 
 The World
The extensive offerings on this list would make any wine lover happy to spend a year on this luxury residence at sea, sipping and watching the world float by. Of course, there are requisite top Provence rosés to sip while on deck, such as the savory Château Pibarnon from Bandol, but you'll find enough super serious Bordeaux and Burgundy to please a connoisseur. And prices are, surprisingly, very reasonable.
 
 
Humm and Nicaise gave the Eleven Madison Park stamp of excellence to 
 (Caceres, Spain), 
 (New York), 
 (Copenhagen), 
 (Vienna), and 
(Walland, Tenn.).

=== Title: An Italian Spritz Is the Perfect Happy Hour Cocktail: Recipes - Bloomberg ===

Yes, spritz champions Talia Baiocchi and Leslie Pariseau know that plenty of Americans still associate the light, fizzy drink with its 1980s suburban incarnation, the white wine spritzer. But in their new book, 
, the authors make an excellent case for the chic, Italian-style cocktail—bubbly, low in alcohol, and with an edge of bitterness, it's ideal for sipping in the golden hour before dinner.
Baiocchi is the editor of the drink site 
, which publishes some of the most thorough and exciting writing on the subject, and Pariseau is the site’s former deputy editor. Together, the authors took a road trip through Italy in a Fiat 500, getting the measure of regional spritz styles and adopting the leisurely spirit that drives Italian happy-hour culture. In Venice, they found that friends bar-hopping for rounds of classic Venetian spritzes and snacks was still the norm, while in Milan, modern, ritual-bending cocktails were often served right alongside the Negroni Sbagliato—the city's classic of Campari loosened up with vermouth and prosecco.
The book includes 40-odd drink recipes (plus some for bar snacks), many from American bartenders who dig the tradition. The spritz is by nature not a very complicated thing to put together, though a few of the recipes might ask you to make a syrup in advance or to hunt down an esoteric bottle of Italian bitters.
First, Baiocchi and Pariseau guide readers much farther back than the 1980s, deep into the history of the drink, starting around 400 B.C., when the Greeks and Romans were drinking wine diluted with fresh water, seawater, and even snow. 
The spritz’s other important defining ingredients—the bubbles and the bitterness—came a bit later in the story, and now a classic spritz is an easily hackable formula of wine, soda water, something bitter, and a little citrus. Take the delightful Venetian spritz, the very first recipe in the book. You build it in a rocks glass with 2 ounces of a bitter liqueur such as Aperol, 3 to 4 ounces of prosecco, and 2 ounces of soda water. Garnish with an olive and orange wheel, and you're done.
Once you’ve mastered that basic spritz, Baiocchi and Pariseau have plenty of other fresh suggestions, including this particularly delicious one that’s savory with Castelvetrano olive brine. It might look as potent as a dirty martini, but here’s the beauty of the fizzy, low-alcohol, and pleasingly bitter spritz: It’s a much softer way to land at the end of your work day.
1 ounce Amaro Nardini
¼ ounce Aperol
¼ ounce fresh lemon juice
¼ ounce Castelvetrano olive brine
2½ ounces prosecco 
2 Castelvetrano olives, on a toothpick for garnish
Add all the ingredients except for the prosecco to a cocktail shaker with ice and shake until well chilled. Strain into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass and top with cold prosecco. Garnish with olives.

=== Title: Little Park Review: Where to Get Your Freekeh On - Bloomberg ===

Beets and goat cheese go together like a yawn and an afternoon nap. They’re a gorgeous little snooze. If, like me, you’d forgotten why the duo earned their it-couple status in the first place, so many decades ago, you might want to consider the risotto at Andrew Carmellini’s latest restaurant in Tribeca, 
.
The dish is stained neon purple with beets, and it’s creamy with a fresh, tangy goat cheese ($16). The grains are cooked so they’re quite loose and tender, but still somewhat self-possessed, ever-so-slightly chewy. All this makes you want to take it in slowly, like a fine scoop of ice cream, so its mellow flavors can expand softly in your mouth. Scattered with poppy seeds and petals of raw beet, the dish makes a pretty airtight case for why beets and goat cheese really do belong together, forever. Order it.
Chef de cuisine Min Kong was previously at 
, the Italian-American fantasy land. Though the food at Little Park involves less drama, it’s quietly playful and, more important, well-executed. You’ll find some of its loveliest compositions involve a lot of grains and vegetables, so I suppose you could call this kind of menu “vegetable-forward.” (Just as you could call this winter snow-forward and my waiter handsome-forward.) 
One of my favorites of these vegetable dishes is the celery root pastrami ($13), a clever sort of riff on the brined, smoked, steamed meat sliced to order in good delis. Though it looks nothing like black-edged hot pink beef stuffed between two slices of bread, it refers to the meat eloquently. The celery root is in a mass of ribbons, aggressively smoked, and ruffled over rye crumbs so it’s thick enough to cut through with a knife. Like a mustard-smeared pastrami sandwich at Katz’s, it’s really pushing it with the acid, the salt, and the sweetness, and it leaves you both satisfied and a little bit thirsty.
The beetroot tartare ($15), with a heap of powdery, crisp crumbs and cool smoked trout eggs, in a moat of horseradish-spiked sour cream, is an excellent alternative to a salad before moving on to, say, the crisp-skinned duck with syrupy sour grapes.
The vegetable section is the largest on the menu, but yes, there are plenty of 
 dishes, too. These should not be overlooked, as they’re cooked consistently well, seasoned properly and generously, and presented without pretense. Even if you never want to see another roasted chicken, you may be impressed by the one at Little Park, with its perfectly crisp skin and salty meat, laid over freekeh (roasted green wheat). The mid-rare steak in careful slices with a bright green herb-y sauce sounds like nothing special; again, the technique applied is careful and exact, and the dish is delicious.
One of the best things I had to eat at Little Park was even simpler: a wide bowl of clams and mussels with smoky beans and bits of bacon ($15). It was like a cheap thrill on a horribly cold night, loaded up with many kinds of fresh herbs and served piping hot. If it doesn’t come alongside, ask for some bread and butter.
Carmellini is a midwesterner who built a restaurant empire in New York. He has places of varying degrees of fanciness in the city, including a sausage stand in Madison Square Garden. (And with the academic and writer Gwen Hyman, his wife, he co-wrote an excellent book on Italian food called
)
These restaurants are smart, tightly themed crowd pleasers: the 
 with the Excellent Bakery (my favorite), the 
 that Specializes in pasta, the 
 with the Fried Chicken. Little Park is not as easy to categorize. The tiny, raw Peconic Bay scallops, served in the shell with grated radish, tasted almost traditionally Japanese, while that risotto was like a warm, fuzzy love letter to California in the 1980s, and the glorious cinnamon toast ice cream hearkened to the glories of a sweet, industrially-produced cereal. The appropriate label here is that oft-meaningless catchall, Modern American, which feels insufficient.
Dinner reservations are tough to achieve at the moment, but lunch is an excellent time to go, when the dining room is airy and quiet enough to take a meeting. A lunchtime-only sandwich made with a thick slice of fried celery root is almost as clever as that pastrami—the vegetable is crispy, meaty and satisfying, meant to mimic schnitzel. But it’s so hard and crunchy that it makes eating the sandwich messy. It needs some tinkering. (The biggest sandwich-building rule is this: Everything should give at roughly the same rate, so things aren’t squishing out from all ends.) The smoked egg-and-avocado sandwich is a better bet.
Little Park is in 
, a 100-room hotel in Tribeca. It has its own street entrance, and the 85-seat dining room is bare and stylish, with plenty of blonde wood and hanging plants. But something about the low-hanging, hourglass-shaped lampshades gives the dining room a real breakfast-included sort of air, so you can’t forget you’re in a hotel.
Not that anyone cares; the restaurant is packed with good-looking groups of men and women dressed in brogues and heels despite the snow, here to drink cocktails and share orders of ravioli stuffed with black kale. One evening at the bar, a thirtysomething woman with red lips and a miniature leather backpack over her white boucle coat leaned over me to order “two glasses of Rittenhouse rye on the rocks, with three cherries in each.”
Dessert can be fantastic. Don’t miss the exquisite caramel-covered pile of slightly sour beer ice cream and apple sorbet with slices of apple. (On the menu, this is called the "Winter Sundae.”) It’s bracing and delicious and covered with clusters of barely sweet, crunchy bits of puffed bulgur wheat for texture, as easy to love as caramel corn. Have you ever enjoyed bulgur wheat before? You will.
Go, eat it now, before the weather turns sunshine-forward, and the menu changes over to spring things.
 is in The Smyth, 85 West Broadway (Tribeca); +1 212 220-4110 or

: Two Stars (Very Good)
: Beet risotto ($16); Celery root pastrami ($13); Spiced shellfish ragu ($15); Spatchcock chicken ($18); Grass-fed hanger steak ($22); Smoked egg sandwich (lunch only; $17)

: In addition to the bar up front in the restaurant, there’s Evening Bar on the other side of the lobby, which is ideal for lounging by the fireplace and sipping cocktails.
 

=== Title: Taste-Testing All the Wines at Starbucks’ New, Boozy Evenings Program - Bloomberg ===

At 5 p.m. in the North Seventh Street Starbucks in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, people at wooden tables sip lattes and focus on their laptop screens. Gnarls Barkley’s 
 plays on the sound system as I face 10 glasses of wine.
The giant coffee company rolled out its new “
” program of serving wine, craft beer, and small plates last month in 70 U.S. locations. I stopped by the first spot to open in New York in order to put the selections to a taste test.
 The Williamsburg location is, thankfully, a Starbucks at which you can actually imagine sipping a glass of wine. It’s more New York hipster loft than the typical soulless venue that offers you a morning jolt of caffeine. Think exposed brick walls, a mural by a tattoo artist, mod shelving with coffee trees growing in pots, and large tables made from slabs of recycled wood. In one corner, comfy chairs invite you to settle in, glass in hand.
Starbucks 
 with the Evenings idea in Seattle several years ago. It plans to expand the program to 2,000 U.S. locations by 2020, hoping to add $1 billion in revenues.
 When I arrive, none of the 40-odd customers is drinking wine, though alcohol and food are served from 4 p.m. to closing. A chalkboard behind the bar announces the day’s featured wine-and-food pairing—Malbec with truffle mac and cheese. (Which, I discover, is a terrible combo.)
The jazzy foldout menu offers tasting notes for each wine, mostly accurate: "aromatic and crisp with melon and passion fruit notes" for a Villa Maria white; "dark fruit and brown spice with hints of clove and pepper" for that Alamos Malbec, although in this instance, it was quite optimistic, rather than completely accurate. Unlike any other wine bar that I’ve been to, there are also calorie counts for each—140 to 150 calories—per New York's law for chain restaurants. 
I order five plates, two beers, and all 10 wines—one sparkling, four white, five red. (A group of coffee-drinking mothers with kids stare and mutter.) The manager, Brandon Giles, who is wearing a porkpie straw hat and a long black apron, brings them on dark wooden trays, in stemless Riedel glasses that are etched with New Age-y mantras such as “breathe out, drink in.”
 If you’re a vino novice, you’ll be fine. Almost all the wines are inoffensive, easy drinking choices, although I wrote “ugh, avoid,” in my note on the 2013 Apothic, a red blend from California that tasted like a sweet cherry coke. At $8, it was the cheapest wine on the list.
Starbucks brags that a five-person team in Seattle, led by an in-house sommelier, made its way through 500 wines to come up with these 10, widely available, brand-name picks. The program gives the nod to the most popular wine categories of the past few years, except rosé. (Locations in such places as Oregon and Washington include at least one local brand; a New York State wine may make it to the Brooklyn location at some point.) 
By-the-glass prices seem reasonable by New York standards—$8 to $15—but you should know that bottles of most of these wines cost the same price at retail as a single glass does here. Starbucks will also sell full bottles if people want to order them; five have been sold in the past month.
The biggest impact of Evenings may come in locations outside big cities, where there's nowhere else to sip and talk. Maybe, just maybe, they'll entice a whole new group of people to drink wine. 
One of the best bets is fruity, foamy 
 ($9). It’s simple, but good with the truffle popcorn ($2.45). Part of its appeal is super-freshness. Giles said they open a new quarter-bottle (187 ml) for each customer.
Other wines might have been open for as long as 3 days, he admitted. They’re preserved with a Vacuvin, which, in my experience, keeps wine fresh only for a day and a half.  
Crisp, bright 
 ($10) is pleasant, with citrus-y hints that perk up truffle mac and cheese ($5.95), as well as the standard, but hardly exciting, cheese plate ($6.95): basic cheddar, herbed goat cheese, manchego, dried apricots, and a fig spread that could use some work. 
More distinctive is 
($9), which shows the grapefruit-y, grassy style of New Zealand that people either love or hate. It’s a solid value, though it didn’t go with any of the five dishes I tried.
Smoky 
 ($12) is not a big buttery California bottling, but you can taste that whack of oak. Don’t expect refinement, but it’s good with truffle mac and cheese.
Light, fruity, sweet
is also quite simple. I peg this as a sipping white that might be popular for the book club get-togethers and Bible-study groups that Starbucks claims are attracted to Evenings, if maybe not in Williamsburg.
For reds, a 
 ($12) from Monterey has a little bit of brightness, hints of cranberry, and a silky texture, but not much more.
The so-so 
 from Argentina ($9) is what you’d expect: smooth, plummy, and a bit dull. But—and this is a big 
it’s a hit with the salty and sweet flavors of bacon-wrapped dates. 
Dark, juicy 
, a Paso Robles blend of cabernet franc and merlot ($15), sells for $45 a bottle at retail.  Spicy, deeply fruity, and tannic, it’s the best (and most expensive) red on the list, excellent with the cacciatore salami on the salumi plate ($5.45).
There had to be a cabernet sauvignon. The 
 ($10) is big and bold, with tobacco-like flavors and plenty of oak, but it's not nearly as good as the Justin.
The first-rate beers are local. The two I tasted, Brooklyn Brewery’s justifiably famous lager ($6) and its spicy Greenmarket wheat beer ($7), were good with everything, especially the cheese plate.
If you want exciting, unusual, well-priced wines by the glass in a casual setting, go to T
 nearby, where you can slurp oysters for $1 each and wash them down with wines far better than those at Starbucks. But people come to Starbucks for comfort, not excitement. It's a spot where you can meet up for coffee and discover it’s late enough to have a drink.

=== Title: Salvation Burger Review: April Bloomfield's Star Is $25, No Fries - Bloomberg ===

People have been asking what I think about 
 since the day it opened in early February. It's a burger place and everyone loves to talk about burgers, but the star burger at Salvation Burger costs $25 and doesn't come with French fries. This detail deeply upsets people because everyone wants fries with their burger. The ones at Salvation Burger—which are thin, crisp in places, and wonderfully salty—cost an additional $7.
Sure, you can find a cheaper hamburger dinner elsewhere. A squishy Shack Burger, which is inconsistently delicious, costs just over $5, and the cheeseburger at 
 is one of my favorites at $17, spare and cheering. The twin patties at 
 are profoundly satisfying at $19, under a heap of caramelized mushroom and onion. There's no arguing that burgers can't be luxury items: Minetta Tavern’s fat, hard-seared burger is $32 (with fries).
April Bloomfield has been making great burgers for years, from the Spotted Pig’s burger, capped with melting Roquefort, to the lamb burger with feta at the Breslin. But her Salvation Burger is its own animal, an extravagant eight-ounce hulk with all the weight and intensity of a good steak. If that's the way you like your hamburger sandwich, this one is worth the $25. If you are more partial to any of those other styles listed above, the Salvation Burger's price point will likely remain a mystery, yet another of New York’s small, peculiar injustices.
The source of the meat is neither a secret nor a celebrity butcher in New Jersey. Bloomfield ships in whole cows (going through three to four each week) from a farm just west of Albany, N.Y., so the kitchen can mix un-aged cuts from almost the entire animal for the patty (some parts get used up in appetizer specials such as seared beef heart with salsa verde and chili with corn nuts).
The fresh sesame buns are baked here: puffy and perfect-looking, brushed with rendered beef fat and browned a little. Unless you request otherwise, the meat is served almost mid-rare, blushing pink as can be off the wood-fired grill. Sometimes it comes with only a little smoky, stinky blue cheese dripping with butter and grilled mushrooms; sometimes caramelized onions accompany. Either way, it's delicious—and in direct competition with Minetta's. This is not the sort of burger that disappears in a minute or two. It's the kind you must work at slowly and messily, the kind you daydream about later, when you’re supposed to be doing other things. 
Salvation Burger is a very optimistic name for a burger place, maybe because there is no salvation for the burger, that fat stack of bread and beef whose endless production is taxing the planet. Note: Bloomfield’s veggie burger is very good. The first time I tried one, it seemed a little sad and small and tightly packed. On a more recent visit, it was magnificent, tall as a 
 and dressed up with tangy yogurt. It’s made from a variety of lentils, vegetables, and sweet potato vermicelli, and it is seasoned very lightly with garam masala, an Indian mixture of sweet, warm, brown spices, a move that adds to its depth and sense of meatiness.
The restaurant is connected to the Pod Hotel on 51st Street, a big, loud dining room with raw concrete ceilings and a cattle-themed decor. The best spot, if you can get it, is a relatively private four-seater booth by the wall, with a TV screen playing goofy footage of a fake fire called "extra classy psychedelic yule log" on a 13-minute loop. The counter overlooking the kitchen is comfortable enough if you’re alone, concentrating on a hot dog and beer.
While service is always friendly, it can be inconsistent when it comes to attentiveness and timing. Maybe no one tells your group of four that there are only three oysters and three shrimp per order. The friend who announces herself vegan at the beginning of the meal may not be alerted that the salad contains cheese and the veggie burger has yogurt. These are small things, but once Salvation Burger has figured them out, the restaurant should feel more cohesive and might catch up to the quality and pricing of its food. 
Ken Friedman, the restaurateur and Bloomfield’s partner, is occasionally in the dining room, helping a runner or getting chatty with diners. "April is obsessed with McDonald's," he said to my table as the desserts landed. You can see this most clearly in the exquisite fried apple pie, or the similarly constructed—but even more delicious when fried—lemon pie, which is filled with a barely sweet fruit curd. It’s squared off and golden and served so hot out of the fryer that you must be careful not to burn your tongue. The similarities end there.
 

=== Title: European Menswear Designers Are Pushing Fur for Fall 2016 - Bloomberg ===

On my last night in Milan during the menswear collections, I was enjoying a dinner of fresh linguini at 
, a trattoria in the famed fashion-district Via Monte Napoleone, when I noticed a recurring trend among the (mostly older) lady patrons: fur coats. My dining mate and I had a prime people-watching table near the front of the restaurant and at one point during our meal, we counted 15 over-fluffed minks either entering or exiting the popular spot. Fifteen!
I’ve never seen anything like it: such a casual converging of so many provocative, statement-making outerwear pieces—despite residing for some 13 years in another fashion capital, New York. Not in the wild, at least, on mere fashion civilians. (If you consider ritzy Italian women who wear head-to-toe Prada such a thing.)
The runways of London, Milan, Paris—and yes, even New York—are another story.
Despite being the most polarizing of trends, fur is a near-constant presence in the most luxurious womenswear collections. According to the 
, 73 percent of designers who showed in these four fashion capitals included fur in their collections in 2015. 
But in a twist on the typical notion that fur is purely for women, it's menswear designers who are really pushing fur, full-force, for next season. 
Currently, men's fur fashion 
 of total fur sales. If the current crop of runway looks from the likes of Christopher Bailey at Burberry and the iconic Italian design duo Dolce & Gabbana are any indication, that statistic is certainly set to rise.
“The reason it’s so popular on the runway, especially right now, is that it’s dramatic,” said 
, menswear fashion consultant and 
. “And I think with all this talk of 
, why not splash out, and try something different? I think it seems easier for a ‘guy’ to understand the presence of fur rather than a skirt."
Wooster said that when he thinks about fur on men, he’s reminded of the Ivy League gents from the early 20th century in full-length raccoon coats. But, he said, “luckily we’ve moved on from that.” (Editor's note: these gents 
.) For today’s man, Wooster thinks designers have, at long last figured out ways to make fur more attractive to men—by using restraint.
"I think Yves Salomon [a Parisian clothing label known for its bold use of fur] really paved the way for the current fur mania by combining the military parka with a fur lining and collar," said Wooster. "That has become the most digestible use of fur."
At 
, Bailey added a sporty twist to the usually decadent, uptown look of mink and fox furs by layering it on top of boldly-hued, retro track jackets. And Dutch designer 
, who delighted guests in Paris with a highly acclaimed psychedelic fashion journey at the Opera Garnier, used fur in a "very elegant and cool way" according to Wooster—as pure ornamentation for his sublime army-inspired outerwear.
Not every label took the less-conspicuous approach.
Coach showcased its "version of fur" with reversed shearling coats—some even reminiscent of the unintentional fur icon 
 from 
. Unruly, brown fur has, in fact, become a mega-trend, having also been shown by designers such as 
 and 
, among others. And Fendi gents sported a bright-yellow, oversized furry tote (and 
) with their equally-shaggy ready-to-wear. 
"If you're super rugged, or with the right amount of swagger and confidence, you can for sure pull off that look," said Alan Maleh, founder and publisher of 
. Like Wooster, he thinks that unless you have an almost Kanye West-type personality (read: overly confident), moderation is best. Both men suggest sticking to smaller accents such as a fur trim accessory or lining—like Van Noten's aforementioned coats, or 
 fur-lined loafers that were back for another season—before committing to 
.

=== Title: MBF LM1 MAD Dubai: Green Dials New Trend in Luxury Watches - Bloomberg ===

For a couple of years now, blue faces have been buzzy in the world of mechanical watches. But this year at 
, the leading trade show for luxury timepieces, many brands were experimenting with various shades of green dials—and to great effect.
Notably, 
 showcased a green camo version of its Big Bang Unico Italia Independent, part of a partnership with Fiat heir 
. (You can buy a pair of sunglasses in the same color and material, if you like.) 
 has long had a number of top-selling green watches, and 
 and 
 showed off some handsome new ones this year, too.
But a very rich example of this new trend just came onto our radar, and this one indicates the trend is gaining traction in the communities that are still investing in luxury watches despite a global financial slump.
The newest 
, a 13-piece special update on the out-there watch brand's marquee line, has a jewel tone green dial that is a real head-turner. It is aimed specifically at the brand's Middle East audience—it will only be sold by Ahmed Seddiqi & Sons at the MB&F M.A.D. Gallery in Dubai. 
The M.A.D. Galleries are experimental sales venues that retail MB&F watches, but also a collection of other technical wonders that they call "Mechanical Art Devices," like 
 and 
. (See also the 
 featured by us last week.) The Dubai gallery is the brand's third; it follows outposts in Geneva and Taipei. 
The green face is created using Chemical Vapor Deposition, which is akin to the Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) you often hear about with high-end watches. (Basically, a very thin layer of coating is created with vaporized metallics that then solidify on the dial base.) And in an additional new flourish, one of the two time dials features Arabic-Hindi numerals. The case is made of grade five titanium, a first for MB&F, and the central balance wheel is fastened into place by two attractive bridges. 

=== Title: The Fat Duck Reopens and Heston Blumenthal Wants to Get Personal - Bloomberg ===

A pillow hovers above the table, bearing your dessert. There's no helium and there are no wires. You place a folded piece of paper inside a cocktail shaker, which then somehow reads your choice and pours the drink you want.
Restaurants are sometimes described as magical, but Heston Blumenthal takes this a little further at the 
, which reopened this week after a £2.7 million ($4.1 million) refurbishment that includes a new kitchen and a new look.
On entering, diners walk past a hologram at the entrance and menu items revolve through the air before your eyes.
In place of a regular menu, there's a map that takes you on a childhood trip to the seaside. It starts with the journey to the coast, continues with a visit to the beach and a walk in the woods, then ends with dinner, followed by bedtime and dreams.
Blumenthal, who became famous with unusual culinary creations such as crab ice cream and snail porridge, says his aim is to trigger memories by engaging all the senses of the diner.
"Eating is a multisensory experience: what you touch, what you hear, what you smell and what you feel, who you are with – all have an effect," Blumenthal says. "And I've been wanting to tell a story, a narrative that provides a context for dishes.
"It's about emotions of curiosity, discovery, adventure, playfulness. As adults, we lose all this. We are too wound up about all the troubles in life. Nostalgia helps counter stress."
All this comes at a cost, of course, and the famed cost of eating at the Fat Duck might itself cause some stress: the price has now risen to £255 per person, excluding drinks and service, payable at the time of booking. That's if you can get a table. The restaurant, in the village of Bray, west of London, seats about 40 guests.
 
 
The Fat Duck reopened after a nine-month hiatus that saw the restaurant and all its staff 
for a vastly oversubscribed residency in Melbourne. The original inn is booked out months in advance, and there are now fewer seats than before.
"I've taken out a table for two," Blumenthal says, interviewed in his new kitchen. "For one table of two, you are probably looking at £250-300,000 of revenue [per year]."
If you do get a table, it really is a remarkable experience. After discussions with the person making the booking, the Fat Duck now tries to build diner profiles before they arrive. The meal is then tailored to individual experiences. So if a diner is from, say, Japan, a Japanese reference may be incorporated; if you were raised on a farm, there may be something reminiscent of a farmyard. (Natural wine might be a place to start: smell is one of the biggest triggers of memory.)
The idea of a journey in time and space will even be reflected in the chairs. Blumenthal has ordered some that resemble car seats, though they haven't arrived yet. Lighting above the table will mark the passing of the day, from dawn through dusk.
I went along to a trial run on Tuesday, when waiters had to navigate round camera crews to reach the invited guests.
The menu is not all new. It features old favorites such as the Sound of the Sea, where diners are served seafood and edible sand while wearing earphones filled with the sound of gulls and crashing waves. The Mad Hatter's Tea Party is there, too, a fob watch that dissolves in a cup of mock turtle soup.
But there are new elements, too. A cup filled with hot and cold liquids side-by-side now contains veloute of rabbit with tarragon and mustard.
About two hours in, a three-course silver-service dinner arrives, representing the dinner taken at the end of your day at the seaside. The poached and hot-smoked langoustine with shiitake mushroom, kombu and birch syrup/cocktail sauce and little gem is particularly fine.
It illustrates the general point: although Blumenthal has the image of a mad food scientist, his ultimate focus is on flavor. His food – which I've eaten many times – isn't just exciting to look at. It's delicious.
He plays with all your senses in order to magnify the experience of taste. In case you are in any doubt, there are now magnifying glasses on each table.
Having said that, I am still trying to fathom how the cocktail shaker worked out that I wanted a nitro-poached Campari soda. (The cocktail comes in a frozen coating. You pop it in your mouth, where it explodes, releasing intense flavors.)
I can reveal the secret of the floating dessert, however. It's all done with magnets concealed in the pillow that hovers above the table. Spooky.

=== Title: Uruguayan Tannat Is the Ultimate Big Red Wine for Steak - Bloomberg ===

At celebrity chef Francis Mallmann’s personal retreat in Uruguay, sausages and sweetbreads were sizzling outdoors on his 
, a grill over an open wood fire. I heaped my plate. Later, when he passed the second course, a platter of short ribs and thick rib-eye steaks dripping with juice, I couldn’t resist even more meat. 
The table was littered with open bottles, but the best wine with all that grass-fed beef was a rich, spicy Uruguayan red made from the Tannat grape by a new winery, 
. I savored the combo as I tried to pick out constellations from a star-studded sky while the sky darkened over green hills with granite outcroppings.
Meat is a big deal in Uruguay, as I discovered during a recent week of winery visits in this under-the-radar South American grape and gaucho haven. (Picture a population of 12 million cows, three times the size of a citizenry that consumes more beef per capita than anywhere on the planet but neighboring Argentina.) 
Naturally, there’s a huge need for a serious steak red, which where Tannat comes in. What makes these reds as meat-friendly as wines can get is their high level of tannin, which comes from the grape’s extra-thick skin and multiple seeds. (Tannin, Tannat, get it?) 
A scientist once explained it to me this way: When you drink and chew, tannin molecules bond with and soften the protein in steaks. They also soften the fat,
releasing the meat’s flavor and mellowing the wine’s tannin. Trust me, this works. I had daily meat-centric opportunities to judge how well. 
Early immigrants to Uruguay from Spain and Italy brought their native grapes such as Sangiovese. A Basque immigrant arrived later, in 1870, with Tannat vines from the grape’s home in the Western Pyrenees of France. These helped kick-start the country’s wine business of producing rustic reds. (Tannat goes back to the 13th century in the French town of Madiran, where it’s still the main grape variety, making fierce, powerful wines.) In the last 15 years, a few longtime Uruguayan producers and a wave of new boutique wineries have made a big push toward quality, raising the country’s prospects for recognition in the world vino marketplace. 
A few basic facts: Today, Uruguay has about 300 wineries, but only about 40 are making export-quality fine wine. Just about all of these are clustered in four main regions in the south of the country, not far from the coast (and its 300 miles of beaches), with the majority in Canelones, which surrounds the country’s capital, Montevideo. We’re not talking about a lot of wine; the 68 million cases or so that Uruguay produces in a year is less than the amount made by Chile’s Concha y Toro group. 
More than 25 percent of the country’s 22,000 acres of vineyards produce Tannat. It’s the most widely planted varietal, and just about every vintner makes one. They’re hoping that this signature grape will sprinkle the same kind of economic fairy dust on their country that popular Malbec has upon Argentina’s wine industry. (Tannats are now trickling into the U.S. and U.K. See my picks of the best, below.) 
To my palate, Tannat wins out over Malbec. Both have a similarly smooth power and broad-shouldered character, but the best Tannats also come with a rich complex of berry, spice, and dark, earthy-stony flavors perked up by juicy acidity. 
The problem with the grape for winemakers is how to tame all that tannin. You want enough to give structure and steak-friendliness, but too much assaults your mouth with dark, puckery bitterness. That’s why many wineries, such as top new boutique 
, often blend Tannat with such other grapes as Merlot, Cabernet, and Syrah. Others try to soften it with oak aging, though too much oak adds other aggressive flavors like raw wood, vanilla, and bitter coffee. 
Thanks to new viticultural research, the best all-Tannat wines are getting pretty exciting. 
At 
, in the region near Montevideo where most of the wineries are located, Daniel Pisano explained it over a plate of beef: “The secret of Tannat is low yields so the seeds ripen enough.” Picking later helps, too.
Over more beef elsewhere, I hear about gentle maceration, before and during fermentation, so the juice absorbs less tannin from the grape skins. 
Some wineries are betting that the granite soils and hillsides of new area Maldonado, about an hour from glitzy beach resort Punta del Este, will become the top vineyard spots. Tannats from there seem to have a distinctive mineral taste
At Bodega Garzón, billionaire owner Alejandro Bulgheroni is pouring millions into his massive winery building, which incorporates huge granite boulders. No expense has been spared in the quest to produce elegant wines, including investing in concrete fermenting tanks that are copies of those at the great Bordeaux château, Cheval Blanc. Why? The naturally porous material allows air to enter, creating rounder wines without adding the oaky flavors of new wood barrels. Garzón’s first vintage was 2011. 
When the winery opens to visitors early in 2016, it will include a Francis Mallmann restaurant with an open fire pit for grilling meat—and plenty of Tannat on the wine list. That’s reason enough to go.
Picks are 100-percent Tannat, unless otherwise noted. Given limited exports of Uruguayan wines, use a site like 
 to find a bottle near you. 
This exotic blend of Tannat and 15 percent fragrant Viognier from a tiny, new winery has a distinctive and delicious earthy quality. 
A small American-owned winery makes this lively, full-bodied red, which has notes of blackberries.
Dark ruby-colored, this smooth blend of 55 percent Tannat, 23 percent Merlot, and 22 percent Tempranillo from another new boutique winery has Cassis and red fruit flavors and a savory taste of earth and rocks. 
One of the best Tannats I tasted, made by one of Uruguay’s pioneering family wineries, it's powerful, plushy, and plummy, with aromas of rose petals, mint, and herbs. 
A taste of ripe plums and violets, combined with fine silky-textured tannins, add up to a great value. 
Made to emphasize freshness, as well as depth and concentration, this 100-percent Tannat shows off a new, brighter style advocated by U.S. consultant Paul Hobbs. 
Dark, rich, intense, this un-oaked wine was one of the best 100 percent Tannats I tasted, with wonderful floral aromas and more elegance than most. Owner Reinaldo de Lucca is a leader in Uruguayan viticulture. 
Dark fruit, bitter chocolate flavors, and surprising sophistication for the price distinguish this smooth-textured wine. 
A soft, juicy, happy wine, this is the fruity, easy drinking style of an all-Tannat wine.

=== Title: Best Wine 2015 - Bloomberg ===

In 2015, I sampled about 3,500 wines from every continent but Antarctica in my never-ending search for the recommendable. My 10 most memorable bottles range from a great vintage of a rare riesling, to a 
 bargain from the Hamptons, to California’s über-classic cabernet. Taken as a whole, they communicate what’s important in the world of wine today (the rise of traditional winemaking styles and unfamiliar grapes, the new appeal of old champagne) and what might happen next (more hot young things out of Australia, among others).  
Arranged by price, my top picks of 2015:
 
Over lunch at Gramercy Tavern, I fell in love with this spicy, full-bodied Hungarian white that was on the by-the-glass list. Made from the furmint grape, it has chardonnay-like richness and riesling-like zing and minerality. Wines like this are why dry furmint is having its moment. For centuries the grape went only into the country’s expensive sweet aszu wines; this elegant dry version proves you don’t have to spend big bucks to drink great wine. It’s my bargain of the year.  
 
Frothy pink, this slightly sweet pétillant naturel fizz from a Long Island winery in the Hamptons is all gulp-me-now pleasure. The growing popularity of 
 inspired the ever-experimental winemaker Christopher Tracy at Channing Daughters to jump on the trend. Last year was his first vintage, but I think he hit his stride in 2015 with an all-merlot rosé that’s fresh, fun, and irresistible.  
 
I was blown away by this pure, lavender-scented Australian syrah, made in the country’s cool-climate Pyrenees region, when I tasted it in New York with winemaker Ben Haines. Haines is a vineyard hunter, tracking down top spots for his own eponymous label (he also has another winemaking day job). This single vineyard syrah recalls a deep earthy-spicy northern Rhône wine and is a brilliant reminder of how young winemakers are reshaping the image of Australian wine. 
 
A big part of what makes a wine memorable is savoring it at the right time, in the right place, with the right people. This regional pinot from a famously cool vintage surprised me: It’s still juicy, but its mellow cherry, earth, and savory flavors and smooth, silky texture show how well California pinots can age. I shared it with close friends over dinner in Restaurant Daniel’s tiny Skybox, surely the most fabulous table in New York, where we watched the chefs through a big window. 
 
This highly unusual Bordeaux one-off was made by blending barrels of wine from one of the 20th century’s greatest vintages, contributed by famous Medoc chateaux belonging to the Commanderie du Bontemps trade association. It was poured at a dinner in the vat room at Château Lafite Rothschild.  Its aromas of truffles and licorice, cassis and spice flavors delivered a taste of history.
 
Comparing three vintages—1992, 2002, and 2012—of America’s greatest cabernet-based blends over lunch with winemaker Paul Draper was a huge treat. All three reds showed the kind of powerful structure, layered earth and fruit flavors, and elegant balance that Draper has pursued for decades at the rustic winery in the Santa Cruz mountains. The 1992 and 2002 show just how brilliantly this American “first growth” evolves as it ages, but the just-released 2012 was the highlight for me: It’s the 50th anniversary vintage of this classic cab. 
 
At my first dinner at London’s posh, paneled Vintner’s Hall, rebuilt in 1668, I drank this delicious, silky-textured Bordeaux while sitting at a long table under a sparkly chandelier and eating Stilton Welsh Rarebit. The wine had developed all the cedary and tobacco notes you find in a perfectly aged example of what the British wine trade, well represented in black tie, still call claret. My impression failed to be dislodged by the vintage port, chocolates in the shape of swans, or the brass quintet that played “What shall we do with a drunken sailor.” 
 
One of the world’s great white wines, this Alsace riesling comes from a tiny 3-acre walled vineyard that has belonged to the Trimbach family for more than two centuries. I was thrilled to sample five vintages going back to 1975 with Jean Trimbach over lunch at New York’s Bouley. The famous 1990 got my top mark; it looks like warm gold and has such intense, layered flavors of apricots, smoke, and stones that they linger in your mouth for what seems like minutes.  
 
Heady aromas of allspice, toasted almonds, and sandalwood are only half the appeal of this amber-colored tawny port made from a single 50-year old cask. Luxurious flavors of curry, nutmeg, and marmalade kept my palate engaged, too. Unlike vintage port, tawnies mellow for decades in oak “pipes” before being bottled. Very old tawnies are now a thing, and this one was launched this year to celebrate Sandeman’s 225-year history. 
 
Serious tastings can be taxing work (I'm not kidding), but some are pure bliss and remind me why I love my job. At the Dom Pérignon Collectors Dinner at 
, held during this year’s Fête du Champagne in New York, I sucked down every drop in my glass of this rare 1966 DP. Deep, complex, toasty, and almost smoky, it was one of the evening’s 12 stellar vintages. The 1966 stood out as the most perfect Dom Pérignon I’ve ever drunk. 
 

=== Title: How Luxurious Can Fried Food Get? Meet the $200 Tempura Omakase - Bloomberg ===

It might not seem this way, but it's very difficult to pull consistently golden, seemingly greaseless things from a vat of hot oil. Masao Matsui, the chef who previously commanded the fryers at the 
in Tokyo, had been at it for over 40 years when he joined the Japanese restaurant group 
 to open a tempura counter in Manhattan.
Ootoya is a chain (with four locations in New York) where you can generally rely on large portions of Japanese comfort food, like fried pork cutlets on rice, for less than $20. But with their new restaurant, 
, the group is setting its sights on fine dining, offering a $200 tempura omakase.
The curtained entrance, set back on 39th Street, leads you into a quiet network of rooms with sliding doors—a little bar area where you can wait if your table isn’t ready, and a small main dining room with the fryer set up behind the counter. You won’t find Matsui manning the fryer, though: The chef has unexpectedly returned to Japan (due to a "personal issue," according to the restaurant's rep). Shin Kato, who opened the restaurant with Matsui over a month ago, is now running the show. He works with an assistant, drawing shrimp through the oil between long chopsticks, just moments before placing them in front you.
But before you get to the fried stuff, there’s a cup of delicate, slippery 
—the tangy, jelly-enrobed shoots and seed pods of an aquatic plant—along with a few globs of sea urchin. There are cold folds of fresh tofu skin, too, and a tiny bite of braised octopus with the threaded, meaty texture of a slow-cooked short rib. Chawan-mushi, the Japanese-style egg custard served here with a hidden layer of red rice and sea bream, is fantastic, wobbling, warm.
Many of the tempura pieces are masterfully fried, including the cluster of tender fava beans under a crisp see-through veil, and the thick piece of king crab. When I got my first shrimp head—a rose gold carapace with so many delicately crisp, hairy little legs—I thought 
, this is worth the price tag. Later, I wasn't so sure.
The setup for the 10 or so tempura courses, which arrive one by one, involves a steel press for lemon juice, salt and miso salt, and a dashi-based dipping sauce that you can make more interesting with a few spoonfuls of grated radish. The general suggestion is lemon and salt with seafood (crab, shrimp, fish, scallops), and broth and radish with vegetables (shiitake, eggplant, fava beans, asparagus) though you can of course tweak things however you like. When there are two pieces, as there are with the seaweed-wrapped scallop, still raw in the center, and the slender shrimp tails, you're encouraged to taste them both ways.
Service is warm and attentive, with servers in pressed suits leading you through the wooden halls or directing you to the bathroom (where a Toto toilet will yawn open just as you approach it). The Japanese ceramics throughout the restaurant are beautiful, and the compositions of dishes leading up to the tempura can be stunning as well. But on a recent evening, the shell of tempura batter surrounding a shrimp tail was spongy. And while the eggplant tempura was meltingly soft inside, you could see the grease bubbling underneath the surface of the batter, and you could taste it too in an unpleasant gush of hot oil. 
Just when you’re properly full and you think the tempura feast is over, it’s time for 
, a big bowl of hot rice with shrimp tempura, along with a side of miso soup and clams. The shrimp have been steaming for a while under the lid and parts of the batter have slipped away from the meat, to become soft and chewy. It’s the homiest dish so far, rough and comforting, and it’s followed by peaches in syrup.
The meal at Tempura Matsui isn't perfect. It isn’t the kind of $200 tasting menu where you go home feeling hungry, either.

=== Title: Is Jay Z’s New All-Pinot Champagne Worth $760 a Bottle? - Bloomberg ===

Rapper Jay Z’s latest venture, an all-pinot Armand de Brignac “Ace of Spades” Champagne, will be released in October. A few tastes were doled out at Vinexpo in Bordeaux in June, but alas, Shawn Corey Carter didn’t drop by the booth as everyone hoped he would.
This blanc de noirs is the brand’s most expensive and exclusive fizz yet, so when I finally sampled it last week, my first thought was: How much of the $760 price tag is for bling? Short answer: much of it.
Don’t get me wrong. This new Ace of Spades bubbly is full, rich, and tangy—and way better and more elegant than it has to be for a wine that may end up more status symbol than collectible. The buxom fruit flavors hit you right upfront and then reverberate like an insistent rap beat.
And it’s definitely too good to splash in a hot tub, as Beyoncé did with the brand’s all-chardonnay blanc de blancs during 
, a video collaboration with Nicki Minaj that premiered in May. (By the way, that fizz is also too good to splash in a hot tub.)
The blanc de noirs joins a lineup of five other Ace of Spades Champagnes, with similar flashy packaging that definitely exudes, well, excess.
Like the others, the new bottle is coated with a metallic finish and hand-embossed with an Ace of Spades symbol hammered out in pewter. (The original brut, which retails for $300, is gold. The blanc de blancs, shiny platinum; the rosé, bright pink; the rare gold cuvée, bright green; and the slightly sweet demi-sec, dark pink.) I’m not sure why they chose a subdued gunmetal gray, like storm clouds, for the blanc de noirs. Maybe it signals the conquest of a category?
The bottle design, created by French fashion designer Andre Courreges, one of the inventors of the miniskirt, gives the entire Ace of Spades line the requisite luxe fashionista connection. And all of the bottles come in smooth, lacquered black boxes lined in black velvet.
So what’s different about the blanc de noirs? The high price reflects its rarity: Fewer than 3,000 bottles will be released, according to Armand de Brignac Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Besson. He says the brand doesn’t really plan to pour them in Jay Z’s 40/40 Clubs—or create an ostentatious 30-liter Midas bottling weighing 100 pounds, as it did with the brut rosé, which was uncorked in Las Vegas for $275,000.
Like Krug’s Grande Cuvée, the blanc de noirs is “multi-vintage” (a more upscale way to say nonvintage), based on the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. The former, though, goes for a trifling $150 to $200.
Jay Z now owns the Armand de Brignac brand, but its backstory is complicated, complete with a feud. 
The wines are made by the Cattier Champagne house, in the village of Chigny-les-Roses in the Montagne de Reims area of Champagne. The family company has been growing grapes since 1763. The official tale says they registered the brand name back in the 1950s and revived it in 2006 with the help of U.S. distributor Sovereign Brands.
After “discovering” the brut gold cuvée, Jay Z hyped it in his lavish 2006 music video 
. In the video, as Jay Z peruses his cards at a gaming table in Monte Carlo, a waiter presents a bottle of Cristal. The rapper waves it away, then accepts a shiny gold bottle of then-obscure Armand de Brignac Ace of Spades from the silvery briefcase he’d carried into the casino.
That was payback aimed at Frederic Rouzaud, managing director of Louis Roederer, the maker of Jay Z’s former favorite fizz, Cristal. Jay Z felt insulted by Rouzaud’s response to a question about Cristal’s popularity in the hip-hop community. “What can we do? We can’t forbid people from buying it,” Rouzaud told the
. “I’m sure Dom Pérignon or Krug would be delighted to have their business.”
So Jay Z banished Cristal from his 40/40 nightclubs, boycotted the brand, and latched on to Armand de Brignac. What’s never been clear is what kind of marketing or financial involvement he had at the beginning. 
Think of his new blanc de noirs as the anti-Cristal. For one thing, it costs three times more.
Its opaque bottle is the antithesis of Cristal’s clear one, which is wrapped in translucent yellow cellophane to protect the wine inside against ultraviolet rays and bright lights. It’s a blend of vintages, while Cristal is vintage-dated and made only in top years. Ace is all pinot noir, while the latest vintage of Cristal is a subtle, complex blend of 60 percent pinot noir and 40 percent chardonnay.
The Cristal is worth every penny of its $200 price tag, while at least $400 of the new Ace of Spades blanc de noirs is for reputation.
How to drink it? Despite his lyrics in the remix of 50 Cent’s 
, in which he explains “Ace of Spade bubblin’ / Drink it from the bottle, who the f--- need a bucket?” Jay Z prefers his Ace of Spades blanc de noirs in a tulip-shaped wine glass.

=== Title: North End Grill Review: The Danny Meyer Superstar You Don't Know - Bloomberg ===

Play that game where you try to rapidly list all of Danny Meyer’s restaurants, and chances are that recalling 
 happens last, if at all. Though it’s been around for years, it’s often overlooked on the edge of Manhattan’s Battery Park City, where it occupies a large dining room that is catalog-model handsome: well-groomed, cartoonishly attractive, and forgettable.
Still, there are many reasons to go. Last week, amid the nasty, post-blizzard slush, mine was the French onion soup. Oh sure, you know what to expect when it comes to French onion soup: some kind of fortifying, burly liquor of beef stock and onions pressed under the substantial weight of melted cheese on bread. This one went above and beyond all reasonable expectations. The broth was as pale as sunshine through clouds, thin but tenacious. And there, in the center, shining gloriously and dripping with melted fat, was a roasted bone full of hot marrow. You could spoon some out onto the cheesy toast or mash it like softened butter into the onions and thyme leaves along the edge of the dish. It was messy business, but the bowl was anchored with a folded napkin to minimize disaster.
This sort of straightforward, generous, user-friendly cooking has become North End Grill’s strong suit. It was amplified last week, when the bar served an abbreviated menu of bistro standards for a French-themed popup while the main dining room closed to build a new private dining room. Eric Korsh’s eloquent American variants on French cooking at North End Grill often feel like luxuries.
Take the lovingly rendered 
which appears leaner and prettier than the version you’d find at a bistro in Burgundy, where the dish originated, but still maintains the intensity and charm of the original. The duck egg is poached softly, so the yolk spills into a dark moat of mellow red wine sauce, thickening it and giving you something to really mop up with the softened toast. The mushrooms are fairy-wing thin. Atop it all is a flutter of black truffles. This is hefty winter sustenance, somehow made elegant.
Korsh has been streamlining the menu since he joined two years ago. (Since the restaurant opened in 2012, Floyd Cardoz had been chef.) Now you’ll find that the open kitchen and its oak wood-burning grills and mesquite charcoal-fueled ovens are turning out excellent, simple compositions—exquisite whole fish on the bone, thick, juicy pork chops, and sardines split open on toast under a confetti of celery leaves. An appetizer of two fat artichokes, served so you can pull them apart petal by petal and scrape the sweet, smoky meat off with your teeth, seems almost too hands-on for this posh, polished dining room. But this is one of its fundamental pleasures.
The restaurant draws all-male groups in suits for dinner and magazine editors from the World Trade Center for lunch. The bar area occasionally feels like an extension of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., especially late at night, when it’s packed with suits from nearby offices, shouting their reasons for marrying Asian and ordering whiskey and steak.
Although the restaurant is not a steakhouse, the kitchen knows how to cook one. The porterhouse for two, aged for a month at Pino's Prime Meat Market, is one of the more satisfying steaks I’ve had in ages, the meat fiercely brown and smoky, served mid-rare in a plate with its own running juice. Like many of the best dishes at North End Grill, the serving
is dead-simple, just meat tweaked with time and fire and salt. That doesn’t mean you should skip things that don’t come from the grill, such as  the fries crisped in duck fat, or a side of the French-style cheesy mashed potatoes known as 
, which stretches scientific law to hold more melted comté
than seems possible.
Desserts were stronger, more modern and playful, when pastry chef Tracy Obolsky was in charge of them. (She has since moved on to Cookshop.) The desserts are fine now, just not so cheerful and lavish. Though you’re likely to find a 
it’s not delivered as accurately as it used to be at Calliope, where Korsh cooked previously. The waiter splits the airy, warm brioche a little awkwardly by the table before dousing it in rum, then spoons over some whipped cream that was, on two occasions, over-whipped until it went tense and grainy. It was a rare mistake, magnified because the dish was so familiar. (As when your out-of-tune friend risks Whitney’s 
 at karaoke).
Classics like the 
 aren’t novel or cutting edge, but this is part of their allure. It’s easy to forget that a restaurant such as North End Grill — where you can count on the standards being sung gracefully, most often in perfect tune — is rare. 
 

=== Title: Pitti Uomo 89: Italian Tailoring Is Going Casual - Bloomberg ===

, the biannual menswear trade summit in Florence, Italy, is the stuff an excessive Instagrammer’s dreams are made of.
There’s the architectural backdrops, such as the gothic-style Duomo; the golden hour light that illuminates the old bridges that divide the Arno River; food porn such as the obligatory cone of gelato and the city’s famous, massive 
; and, of course, the well-documented street-style scene. The latter has essentially, and unofficially, crowned Florence—and Pitti—the spiritual home of the menswear peacock (for the uninitiated: a man with an enviable yet highly calculated sense of style who puffs up around the famous "
" in hopes of being photographed, as to be reassured of his sartorial dominance and achievements).
Now if I'm being honest, I have a love-hate relationship with the street-style culture. As a fashion journalist, who teeters on the edge of the new guard and the old (who usually practices a more self-effacing approach to expressing one’s style), I absolutely understand the importance of visual self-branding and would go as far as to say I appreciate its far-reaching capabilities. But I also loathe it. Especially when I have to brave every Fashion Week’s surplus of professional show-offs just to do my job.
But Pitti is the exception to my grouchy pseudo-intolerance toward showboating. Here, the vibrancy of the industry makes it hard not to get as caught up in (or at least completely entertained and inspired by) the copious amounts of double-breasted, try-hard fashion hoopla that happens outside and in the Fortezza da Basso, the 16th century fort that has long housed the trade show. 
Yet this season is different. So far it has seemed a lot less … bold. Instead of the usual sea of outlandishly mad-for-plaid-type gents in oversize, fur-trimmed shearling coats and double monk-strap shoes, it has seemed as though a majority of attendees had pared down their attire considerably in favor of a return to a more “quiet luxury."
I'm not alone in these observations. “The flamboyant colors have definitely been toned down,” says Josh Peskowitz, menswear industry veteran and co-owner of 
, a new men’s store in Los Angeles. “People in general don’t feel as done up, and I think this represents the trend toward tailored clothing that men treat more as sportswear. Overall the looks are looser, less constructed, tonal, and casual.”
It’s true, a 
—or elevated sportswear vibe—has certainly taken hold. Instead of eclectic ensembles and, yes, the occasional misstep, such as a lime-green, three-piece suit or a pot-holder-like cardigan layered over overalls, men were mostly in minimalist, but luxe, separates. (Although not yet as informal as to 
.)
"Sartorial Italian brands understand we live in a more casual world now and are creating less formal suits and jackets that work as well with sneakers and jeans as double monks," says Brian Boye, executive fashion director at 
 mentioning the greens, earth tones, and "incredible" casual, unstructured jackets and coats on show. "The emphasis is more function and fabric technology than showboat styles—a classic, wearable vibe for fall."
"Men who might find fashion out of their reach may start to feel more accepting when they see clothes next fall they can actually incorporate into their life," he says.
If you’re one of them, here are my top six style takeaways from the nattily dressed men of Pitti Uomo 89.
But above all, remember to do you. You want to look stylish but not styled. 
“All dressing well really takes is understanding fit, having confidence, and liking what you wear,” says Peskowitz.

=== Title: Review: Camel Burger With Gold Leaf at Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi - Bloomberg ===

Bored with hamburgers? I may have the solution.
How about a camel burger? You can follow up with a cup of camelccino with camel-milk chocolates on the side.
Yep. Yum.
The burger-with-a-difference is on the menu at the 
in Abu Dhabi, where there's no shortage of tourists willing to pay 110 dirhams ($30). The patty is topped with 24 carat gold flakes, fitting for a hotel that makes the Palace of Versailles look minimalist.
Chef 
says the 200 gram (7 ounce) patty is made with minced leg meat, to which he adds cumin, garlic powder and onion powder before cooking it over a gas-fired charcoal grill. 
It's served in a sesame bun with lettuce and tomatoes, rather like a Big Mac, only the cheese is halloumi, not American. The fries are chickpea fritters, and on the side comes a pot of tabbouleh and Arabic pickles.
The dish isn't really aimed at locals, who know the prime cut comes from the hump, where more fat means more flavor.  The meat of young camels is particularly prized and can be served as a wafer-thin delicacy at weddings. 
My previous experience of camels was limited to a ride around the Pyramids and to a dish served by chef Alain Ducasse at 
, his restaurant in the 
 in Doha. There, it's hung for three to four weeks, braised for six days then served with with foie gras, soufflé potatoes and black truffle. At 390 Qatari riyals ($107), it's the most expensive item.
So how does camel taste? At best, you might describe it as gamey, with a deep, dark flavor somewhere between beef and mutton combined with a hint of farmyard. I enjoyed the budget Abu Dhabi camel more than the luxury Qatari.
The patty is slathered with Dijon mustard and topped with crispy onions. It's still a bit dry.

=== Title: Eight Ways Wine Will Change in 2016 - Bloomberg ===

The impact of climate change and new technologies (like the ability to 
) are on my vinous radar for 2016. Sparkling wine, especially ubiquitous 
, is still going strong, but “premiumization” is coming. 
. 
The future for wine looks bright, though 
and 
 are siphoning off plenty of attention. Still, more people than ever (in the U.S. and UK especially) are drinking more expensive bottles—although you can get by
. The fact that 
 is the new fashion color for shoes can’t hurt either. 
Here’s what else I see in my crystal (glass) for the coming year.  
Global consciousness of the quality of English bubbly got a huge boost when 
 in early December that they’d purchased vineyard land in Kent and plan to make top sparkling wines under the 
label. I predict other champagne houses will follow suit. 
The famously cold Champagne region is now warmer than it was a generation ago while even chillier southern England, which has the same chalky soil, has been heating up in a beneficial way. Producers like 
, 
, and
 make fine fizz, but little has been exported. With this French vote of confidence that’s sure to change.
Once embraced solely by a tiny purist fringe, “natural” wine is poised to attract a much wider audience, especially in small, trendy (as well as high-end) restaurants with curious sommeliers. New York, for example, added three new natural wine bars in 2015, including 
and The Four Horsemen, the 
t of LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy.
This is happening not just in the biggest metropolitan areas, but in places like Austin, Texas and Nashville, Tennesee, too.
Partly it's an inevitable consumer move toward artisanal products, coupled with the fact natural wine quality has improved. (Look at 
, a fun entry point with a half-dozen or so American winemakers experimenting today.) And partly it’s because many restaurateurs are taking a more inclusive view of wine, where hard-core no-sulfur examples, top organic and biodynamic bottles from Domaine Michel Lafarge, and Chateau Lafite can co-exist on the same list.
While dozens of obscure, exotic varieties with unpronounceable names will attract buzz, cabernet franc is seriously ripe for its own moment. The most important red grape of France's Loire Valley (itself attracting buzz), cab franc is a rising star in Chile, California, Washington State, Argentina, the Finger Lakes, Virginia, and South Africa. Why? It’s highly versatile and makes fragrant, elegant wines with earthy, spicy, herbal notes with a food-friendly tingly acidity. 
And as the climate heats up in Bordeaux, winemakers at prestigious Pomerol estates like Chateau Lafleur are adding more cab franc to their merlot/cab franc blends because the grapes contribute higher acidity and lower alcohol.
Burgundy is still super hot, pulling in 
. But as trade in top Bordeaux drifts downward on international wine exchange
and Burgundy seems priced for billionaires, Italian reds like Ornellaia and Sassicaia and 2010 Brunello di Montalcinos seem like bargains. But I’m looking to Piedmont as the next collectible territory for out-priced Burgundy lovers. Barolo and Barbaresco offer an awful lot of what makes Burgundy appealing–wonderfully scented, terroir-driven, food-friendly, complex reds from single vineyards. 
When top wines go for ridiculous sums, who can be surprised if winery tours take the same path? The Napa Valley’s 
, a 107-room recreation of a 13th-century Tuscan castle, with fermentation rooms and barrel cellar, has started the ball rolling for exclusive, expensive winery tours. 
, which could include a barrel head branded with your name, a leather bound album of photos of you on the day-long tour taken by a professional photographer, 288 bottles of cabernet sauvignon from your own barrel of wine, with personalized labels, and even a box of 15 Montecristo Platinum collection cigars. 
Champagne house 
 has introduced the ultimate tour in which you can also create your own blend, which will be delivered in engraved bottles. Minimum order 1,000 at a cost of 40,000 euros ($43,722).
A cluster of converging trends will result in better—and many more—wines by-the-glass in restaurants everywhere. Curious consumers are looking to expand their palates; the rise of casual wine-focused bistros reflects the way we eat and drink; and innovative wine preservation technology is now available. 
, a relaxed, less-expensive version of the iconic Paris restaurant, opened a branch in London in October, with, yes, 110 wines by the glass. Meanwhile in San Francisco, 
opened in the Twitter building in July with 114 options priced from $10 to $300. 
The main technology game changer is the Coravin, a device that allows some wine to be removed from a bottle while keeping the remainder fresh. After initial glitches (broken bottles, etc.) a 
 launched globally this year. Expect many more restaurants to begin using it in 2016.  
 Given the popularity of food trucks, the vintners of Saint-Emilion have decided to start their own wine truck—a shiny red vintage 1976 Citroen panel truck with the phrase “
” inscribed on its side. This pop-up tasting room on wheels will make 15 to 20 stops at jazz festivals, wine fairs, and antique markets in four French regions: southwest France, Pas de Calais, Brittany, and Alsace starting in March 2016. A sommelier-driver will pour the rotating 16 wines, alongside winemakers, who will arrive at every stop. 
Surely other wine regions will see the potential. Napa, start your engines.  
Increasingly, wines carry labels with the names of TV series (
), baseball teams, NFL stars, actors like Diane Keaton, books and movies (
).
Now that public relations firms view reds and whites as a way to extend the brand of just about everything, including restaurants, I’m convinced there will be many, 
 more in 2016. (Though I’m not sure the odd match of a 
 adds anything to the image of the New York Yankees.) 
The latest to join the celeb wine club is Grammy-winning musician John Legend, who teamed up with Jean-Charles Boisset, owner of Napa’s Raymond winery, to create “a unique series of rich, soulful and complex notes inspired by true love.” Translation: an opulent cabernet ($85) and seductive chardonnay ($45) under the 
.
No word on whether they’ll sing in the glass.  

=== Title: New York Fashion Week: Mens FW 2016 Best Moments Recap - Bloomberg ===

And that’s a wrap on another menswear season. The biannual rounds, which began in London a month ago, just concluded last night in New York at the 
 show after a standout 
 of 
. The four-day onslaught of runways and presentations showcased a mass variety of styles and wares, from oversized outerwear to delightful new takes on tailoring and evening attire. 
We’ll catch you up on all the global trends soonest. (Invest in a statement hat and 
.) In the meantime, here's the highlight reel from our hometown shows.
The week kicked off with an opening night party at ArtBeam. Guests included the New York Giants' 
, 
 of the New York Mets, and New York Jet 
, official ambassadors of NYFW: Men's and a trio we didn't tire of seeing everywhere. To mark the momentous anniversary, Dockers launched an ad campaign ("Yes, They're Dockers") and a special 30th Anniversary Collection, which included such reimagined classics as a trench coat and weekender bag, in timeless khaki color. At the event, we caught up with Cruz and got his pick for Super Bowl 50 this Sunday. “I’ve gotta go with Manning,” said Cruz. “I want this to be his [John] Elway moment—to go out on top—if this is indeed his last year in the league.”
Well-dressed jazz greats such as Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins inspired the latest collection by designer 
, which kicked off the first day on a high note. Slender models in fitted windowpane trousers and retro-style polos under blazers were staged variously with instruments and as coffee-drinking quartets. Mindful of the Jazz Era, Hart used a cast of all-black male models. (The entire season of menswear shows—from London to New York—should be applauded for having made marked improvements in diverse casting.)
, big brother of handbag designer 
, is expanding his four-year-old men’s accessory brand, Ben Minkoff, with new a full-fledged, ready-to-wear collection geared toward the tech-savvy modern man. The accessibly priced line is a hybrid of Scandinavian fit and a Japanese eye for detail. Highlight pieces included a fur-lined parka, an unstructured raincoat, and Minkoff's casual take on tuxedo trousers. "I saw an opportunity to create a new look for the modern day influencers of the digital era at an amazing price/value ratio,” said Minkoff at the show.  
In his first NYFW: Men's catwalk, industry veteran Jeff Rüdes, co-founder of premium denim line J Brand, wowed with his new-ish luxury menswear line, 
. The high-end sportswear and tailoring line made its debut in August but really hit its stride this season with a memorable fall collection that included sophisticated outerwear and soft tailoring with a lovely throwback vibe. Rüdes is aided in design by Lorenzo Marchese, formerly of Ermenegildo Zegna, and the wares are produced abroad in the same factories as those of Lanvin and Burberry Group Plc.
Designer 
 (yes, nephew of Ralph Lauren) is a true artist. Beyond showcasing his typically rumpled and distressed collection du jour, he likes to set a stage, to engage in storytelling by way of his fashions. He is known for exploring male archetypes, and this season has been no different: Lauren created character sets that included Baja-hooded gangs, dandies, shoeshiners, and boxers sparring in a full-scale boxing ring as the headlining vignette. It was a dynamic, engaging presentation heightened with the lasting image of supermodel Tyson Beckford on a spotlit podium in a “hero hoodie,” looking like the world’s greatest superhero.
 
 
 
 
 
For the first time in 15 years, veteran menswear designer 
 bowed and thanked his supporters at the end of the runway. More than two years since he returned to the namesake brand he founded in 1987 and left in 2005, his return was triumphant. The tailoring-focused collection was true to Abboud's American-spun Savile Row-aesthetic, complete with Harris tweed three-piece suits, washed velvet blazers, and military- and vintage-inspired details. Bonus points to Abboud and company for putting forth one of the strongest-cast shows of the week. 
The trio behind the highly-regarded men’s retail destination 
introduced their own line of menswear called 
. The inaugural collection, mostly comprising luxe outerwear and unstructured but impeccably-fit tailoring pieces, marked the SoHo store's first foray from selling high-end apparel to making it.
“We have ideas, and we want to express these ideas under our own label and our own designs,” said co-founder Brian Trunzo, who along with Matt Breen and Patrick Doss turned out an impressive first effort. He pointed to the HBO show 
, as well as the art of Pablo Picasso, as inspiration. "While we have a great appreciation for that which others create, we really do believe that our point of view is special and should be shared with the world.”
The gents plan to keep their burgeoning design business separate from their storied retail shop, although most of the just-launched collection will be available at Carson Street's new (and vastly larger) location at 20 Greene St. in Manhattan. 
Designers Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow, the duo behind the much-lauded luxury streetwear line 
 surprised members of the press and the VIP guests at their show by opening their runway up to the public outside the venue. In a twist just as the show was about to begin, the black curtain separating the runway from the backstage area was lifted to reveal that part of the runway extended outside, thereby giving a group of huddled fashion students and various onlookers a view of the collection moments before the media waiting indoors got its first glimpse. It’s as if we were in a fishbowl—rather fitting, given that the show's theme was outside/in. This was an inventive and successful way to open the usually exclusive fashion show experience to consumers and fans of the brand.
Great bags and shoes abounded this season, but the accessory that really stood out was not something to be worn or toted. For the second consecutive season, vapes were passed among fashion's elite. This time, however, they made it to the runway in the hands of styled-up models at the 
 show. (At the Richard Chai show last season, thehy appeared as giveaways to VIP first-row guests.) Leonardo DiCaprio, who was photographed indulging at the Screen Actors Guild awards, may be facing a 
, but has his hobby found a place in fashion? (To be determined.) 
Italo Zucchelli, men's creative director for 
, extended his “trinity of metals” vision that he unveiled last month in Milan at the brand’s mainline collection. (You know, the one where a certain 
 caused near-pandemonium). This time, with a focus on the ever-important category of red carpet dressing, Zucchelli’s tinfoil-like pants were matched with an army of all-black, exquisitely tailored tuxedos and outerwear. Zucchelli, who is on the board of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, decided to show this special eveningwear capsule collection in support of NYFW: Men’s in the hopes that other major American designers will follow suit. We're sure that if 
 would come, others would surely follow.
“It’s time to do something different, to cause disruption,” said designer 
. And that’s just what he did.
On Tuesday evening, instead of partaking in a typical runway format at Skylight Clarkson Square, as did such heavyweight designers as Perry Ellis and Joseph Abboud, Varvatos chose to take the media and his guests through a crazy, sensory experience—a fashion-filled labyrinth if you will—at his Bowery store. The space once occupied by rock club CBGB was boarded up with the question "Rock is Dead?" painted across its façade. Inside, masked men (and several mannequins) modeled the collection: pony-hair outerwear paired with coated denim, three-piece velvet suits, loads of shearling and fur. In true funhouse form, it was at times hard to tell fantasy from reality, man from mannequin. Coffins and political messages (the faces of Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton both made appearances) were dispersed amid the killer collection. The installation ended in an all-white room with an angelic blond model in a zebra-print coat with the words "Long Live Rock" posted behind him. A happy ending for rock 'n' roll after all, and quite a fun experience. Final note: Varvatos opened the experience up to the public for two hours during the night hours following the presentation.

=== Title: Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime ref. 6300 Is Handsome, Chill - Bloomberg ===

To celebrate its 175th anniversary in 2014, Patek Philippe made much ado about its newest novelty, the world's most complicated wristwatch. The 
 had 20 complications, from a minute repeater to grand and petite sonneries to an instantaneous perpetual calendar. It was made in 18k rose gold and could be reversed depending on which complications you want to look at. 
It was also a little bit ... busy.
The complications aside, the rose gold case was hand-filligreed to within an inch of its life. So was the crown and even the lugs. If you were lucky enough to be one of the six people given the privilege to spend $2.6 million on the watch (which is a whopping 16.1mm high), no one was going to miss this on your wrist. It was glamorous, it was a spectacular mechanical achievement, and it was statement making. But it was 
subtle.
This year at Baselworld, Patek debuted an update to the watch, which will be made more widely available. The 
 will be the most complicated wristwatch in continuing production, featuring the same 20 complications as the anniversary edition. It will be made in 18k white gold, with one face in ebony opaline and the other in white opaline, and will also swivel depending on which complications you need to use.
It is also a little more chill. 
 
 
This watch still wears big on the wrist, at 16.1mm in depth from crystal to crystal. The diameter is 47.4mm. No one is going to miss it. But the white gold and the understated case change the entire character of the watch. It doesn't need to shout for attention—it just needs to be worn. It's simple; basic, almost.
The mechanics are still incredibly complex (complications listed at the bottom of this post), with a 72-hour power reserve on the manual movement, three gongs, five different time strikes, and 108 jewels. The finishing inside is incredible.
 
 
The watch will not be made in limited edition, but the complexity of the movement will mean Patek will produce very few every year. It will retail for 2.2 million Swiss francs, which would be converted into USD based on exchange rate at time of sale. (Right now that's about $2.3 million.)
Here's that list of complications.

=== Title: Houseman Review: The Spectacular Burger Is One of Many Stars - Bloomberg ===

 is good at a lot of things, but it’s the consistent, careful deployment of cheese that makes my knees wobble. A snow-white slice of liquified Melville—a buttery cow’s milk cheese from Connecticut—holds together charred broccoli, gritty with breadcrumbs and chilies. Let it cool a bit, so the cheese strings way out like a loose bungee cord, and it’s even more fun to twirl and eat. Flutters of briny goat cheese sweeten and season a pile of bitter purple chicory leaves dressed with lemon and olive oil. And though you can only find it at lunchtime, described as a French onion sandwich, Houseman makes an extraordinary grilled cheese with caramelized onions and big, squeaky, half-melted cheddar curds.
The burger is something, too. It involves two thin, crisp-edged patties with a faint line of pink running through each center, fused together with melted swiss cheese and a sweet, delicious black mass of deeply caramelized onion and mushroom. This is all contained in a Martin’s potato roll, the ideal vehicle for a burger because while it’s pleasingly squishy, it knows how to hold itself together under the duress of dripping cheese and beef juice. There’s no cheese in sight on the fries, and I’d be inclined to complain about them costing an extra $2, but I do believe they are perfect. (Which is to say, the way I like them: thick, salty, and super crisp).
Owner Ned Baldwin worked at Prune before opening Houseman last summer in Manhattan’s Hudson Square. The restaurant seats 50 at spare wooden tables in a simple dining room of painted white brick, along with an additional 10 at the bar. The kitchen, which Baldwin runs with co-chef Adam Baumgart, turns out excellent, unfussy food that is generous in spirit as well as portion.
Maybe it’s a coincidence that some of New York’s most vibrant and dependably delicious restaurants are run by duos, rather than a single superstar. Ann Redding and Matt Danzer turn out excellent Thai food at

. Fabian von Hauske and Jeremiah Stone share responsibility for the excitement at 
. Collaboration can be good for creativity, the way that a double-patty burger can add up to more than the sum of its parts. And though Houseman doesn’t bother too much with exact replicas of all-star American comfort food, many dishes manage to feel friendly and familiar, even when they’re not. On a recent evening, the warm salad of turnips with fried prunes and almonds had all the balance and heft of a winterized 
, but with candy-sweet turnips swathed in sliced speck.
The meatballs at Houseman aren’t the ultra-smooth, bread-inflated variety you know and love, but something more dark and intense, coarsely ground so you know just what you’re eating: meat. Baldwin buys whole lambs from a farmer in Vermont and pulls more threads of braised meat from the necks and breasts to make the surrounding tomato sauce sing. With the fat slices of charred bread on the side, plus a glass of Maker’s and maple, it’s enough for dinner.
Houseman’s menu is pleasingly concise, unpredictable, and printed daily with line drawings that wouldn’t look out of place in a Victorian children’s book. They often involve elaborate anthropomorphized vegetables, or rotund, web-footed men in suits, and though it's possible they'd give me nightmares, I wouldn't hesitate to buy them and put them up on my walls if it were option.
Dessert doesn’t rotate quite as much as the rest of the menu, even though it’s smudged on a tiny chalkboard. You can almost always count on the peanut tart, a fine, low-to-the-ground number with a crisp pastry, plenty of actual peanuts, and very little of anything else. The malt ice cream with chocolate sauce is wonderful, with crunchy pieces of bread fried in brown butter. I love a bloomy-rind wedge for dessert, but the one Houseman served on a recent evening came with tasteless apple slices that did nothing for it. For a kitchen that's so deft with cheese-dealing elsewhere, this felt like betrayal.
Still, when the candlelit dining room fills up in the evening, and you’re clinking frozen glasses of aquavit, Houseman is the kind of place you might dream about coming to as a regular. Service is easygoing and friendly. Though the staff doesn’t get too hung up on the details, sometimes you wish they would: The food might arrive in no particular order—or all at once. Who knows? The crowd changes, too. Men in distressed-leather boots and denim come here, and women in vintage sequined jackets. Two twentysomethings meet straight from the office at 10 p.m. to run bread through a salty puree of Italian beans while gossiping loudly about their boss. There are always friends catching up over wine and roast chicken.
“Oh, God! My chicken!” One woman cries, pointing to the brown carton of leftovers she’d very nearly forgotten on the ledge by her table. “My chicken! I can’t leave without my chicken!” I’m not sure which one she was referring to; sometimes the bird is roasted and served plain with grilled bread and parsley salad, and sometimes it’s swimming in a thin, tart tomato gravy with roast carrots. Both are simple and superb. The only thing that doesn’t change at Houseman is the leftovers. They are too good to leave behind.

That begat a 2013 “Cut Your Teeth” series at the Santa Monica Museum of Art that was as much dinner party as installation—a riot of colors, textures, and excellent modern American food eaten in a “darkly wooded den” of taxidermy, moss, and plants, with blaring music and smoke machines, all under a coyote-tooth chandelier. A 2014 revisit ended with diners 
 against the wall. Now he’s at it again.
Although Thornton is holding specific details close to his chest, he tipped us off to a new participatory dinner series opening at end of March and running through July at another major L.A. institution: nine courses; a meaty menu inspired by surrounding sculptures; 22 diners per seating max; tickets in the $250 range. Though all this could change, of course. With Thornton, it’s best to delight in the unexpected. (Although this being bonus season, splashing out with a private buyout can guarantee you’ll get in;

Even if your bonus 
 big enough to buy a house (and if so, congrats), given the current real estate market you might be better served by merely looking at architecture instead. The city of Brasília, designed from scratch by Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa, is arguably the most stunning, and certainly the most monumental planned, community of the past 60 years. Brasília was built in the barren highlands of the center of the country to replace Rio as the capital in 1960, and everything in the city is on a grand scale. You can debate its merits as an actual place to live (surprise, residents of this government town find the six-lane highways bisecting its center a little impersonal), but as a center for architecture it's truly unprecedented. 
Visitors can take four- or eight-hour 
 led by a trained architect—tours for a small group range from $230 to $420, depending on the time. As for lodging, be prepared for decent, not spectacular accommodations—the city has yet to fully embrace the 5-star trend. At the

=== Title: Paris's Local Restaurants Are Their Best in Decades - Bloomberg ===

Paris, with its Old World charms, had begun to look old hat as a dining destination in recent years after 
, New York and 
 grabbed attention as centers for creative cooking.
No more.
French chefs are looking again at how to build on their country's culinary traditions, absorbing ideas from around the world while retaining the integrity of their cuisine. There's a new spirit of imagination and focus.
Gains in the kitchen have been matched by advances in the dining room: Service is better than I have known it in more than 40 years of visits to Paris. You don't need to speak French to be well received. Even in restaurants without English menus, there is a desire to communicate and share (and you can
).
But you do need to know where to go. The tourist joints are no better than in other cities. Indeed, they are worse because they have no excuse. And the top-end restaurants are prohibitively expensive.
I asked some of France's most celebrated chefs - culinary masters weighed down with Michelin stars and other accolades - for pointers on casual places to eat great food at reasonable prices. They named 21 bistrots and brasseries that alone justify a trip to a city that has found its mojo.
Once again I love Paris. 
This charming restaurant in Saint-Germain-des-Près was founded by a woman, Marthe Allard, in 1932. These days it is owned by Alain Ducasse, and the kitchen is headed by another woman,  Laëtitia Rouabah. "It's a beautiful bistrot, a bit old-fashioned and really charming," says chef Helene Darroze of 
. "Laëtitia's food is amazing." 
of 
 agrees. "I love the atmosphere and the location, and the pâté en croute is simply the best," he says. If you are on a budget, the lunch menu is 34 euros ($38); a la carte prices are high, with mains starting at 34 euros for ox cheek and carrots.
This tiny Kosher restaurant in Le Marais is a destination for lovers of Middle Eastern cuisine and has attracted attention around the world. There are often long queues outside. "I started going long ago, when I was a young man," says Thierry Marx of 
 at  the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. "It is the best falafel in Paris."
This is a contemporary brasserie by Alain Ducasse at a new development, 
in 
. It's large with an industrial design that won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I loved it. One wall is given over to a large board - looking like an old railway departure sign - whose letters clatter into place to tell you about soufflés that are about to come from the oven. The lobster bisque version (22 euros) is epic. Champeaux opened on April 11, and this recommendation is mine alone.
This bistrot in the 11th arrondissement is a favorite of 
, the celebrated chef whose restaurants include 
. "You can eat very well here and the place is very lively and friendly," he says. "The décor is typical French bistrot style, with traditional furniture, but the food is lighter and full of flavor. There's also a great wine list. Among the dishes you must try are the Soufflé au Grand Marnier. "
Chef Thierry Blanqui is a veteran of grand restaurants such at 
 and 
. At this restaurant, he serves traditional cuisine inspired by his origins in Auvergne at affordable prices. The  menu is 32 euros for three courses at lunchtime and 36 euros for dinner, with tasting menus at 45 euros and 55 euros.  Dishes may include poached hake, lemon juice and wild rice. "His cooking reflects his personality and the times," says 
 of 
. "He uses high-quality produce, but not always the most expensive. "
This small bistrot in the Third arrondissement is always crowded and popular with tourists, but that's no reason not to like it. "It's an institution," Piege says. "They serve the best roast chicken and fries. I know all the team and they are very kind." I couldn't get a table, so I'll have to take chef's word.
This neighborhood bistrot in the 11th arrondissement has fans around the world, including the TV chef Anthony Bourdain. "It's very classic, very traditional - just very good food," says Claude Bosi of 
 in London. 
agrees: "They serve the best steak au poivre in Paris."
This neighborhood bistrot near the Bourse seats only about 20 diners and is owned by chef Daniel Rose and his wife, Marie-Aude. "They serve a great veal pot au feu and many bistrot classics that are made with great ingredients," says 
of 
. "Their wine list is strong, too."
Chef Yves Camdeborde's bistrot in Saint Germain is popular with Parisians and tourists alike. Even a dish as simple as a black pudding terrine with potato salad (12 euros) is rich and beautifully made, while the wine list is accessible and reasonably priced. "Yves is one of my best friends," Piege says. "I always love to go to his restaurant because it is so good and the wine list is amazing."
"This place is close to my restaurant in the Sixth," Helene Darroze says. "It's one of four opened by Christian Etchebest, a chef from southwest France. He's very well-known and he is a good guy. He cooks very well in a simple style."
This, the only Italian restaurant on the list, was opened in 1978 by brothers who wanted to share the tastes of their childhood in Molise, in central Italy.  The menu is seasonal and the prices are reasonable. "The food is wonderful," Thierry Marx says.
This Montparnasse seafood restaurant traces its history to 1898 and has been a gathering place for artists and intellectuals for more than a century. "This is very Parisian and I like it a lot, says Pierre Gagnaire of the three-Michelin-star 
. "I've been going there for about 30 years. It's welcoming and the food is simple, not pretentious. The staff are nice." Michel Roux Sr. agrees. "This place is known for its beautiful seafood," says Roux, who held three stars at  
 before handing on the restaurant to his son, Alain.
This cluttered restaurant in a flea market is known for its lively atmosphere, loud music and kitsch décor, rather than its food. "The food isn't very good," says Thierry Marx, even as he enthusiastically recommends Chez Louisiette.  "You go there for beer with sausages and chips. It's my kind of place. It's a lot of fun."
; +33 1 40 12 10 14
This bistrot (which in times gone by was a gathering place for the clowns of the Cirque d'Hiver) has attracted a lot of attention since being taken over by the team behind 
 wine bar and restaurant. "Xavier Lacaud in the front of house and Sota Atsumi in the kitchen are a great team," Frenchie's Marchand says
 "They serve great natural wine and tasty bistronomy food."
This seafood restaurant on the rue de Seine is one of my favorites in Paris, with a great choice of more than a dozen types of oyster along with inexpensive wines. (The waiter recommended a fine Muscadet at 21 euros a bottle.) Huguette looks like a tourist joint, with seats along the street and staff dressed in striped tops. But it is so good, I would travel to Paris for lunch to eat here. "This is authentic and very French," Gagnaire says. "The shellfish and the oysters are really fresh. The French fries and the apple tart are good, too!"
This chicken restaurant in the tourist heart of Montmartre is unassuming, yet it belongs to three-Michelin-star chef Antoine Westermann, and the standards are sky high. "This is the best chicken money can buy," says Pierre Koffmann of 
, who held three stars at La Tante Claire in London. "It reminds you of what chicken should taste like. I love the simplicity and I love the focus." The star is Bresse chicken with fries, macaroni cheese or salad, at 98 euros for two to four people.  
This restaurant in the First arrondissement describes itself as a gastronomic bistrot. Chef Tomy Gousset - a veteran of 
 and 
- serves just five starters, five mains and five desserts. Prices start at 20 euros for a main and a dessert. "It's very simple, but very honest food," says Claude Bosi. "The wine list is particularly good, and there's a great atmosphere."
This restaurant inside 
, an antiques market in the north of Paris, is designed by 
and is predictably stylish, with bare brick walls and an open kitchen. What is less expected is the friendliness and warmth of the service. It's the pick of Helene Darroze. "The food is simple but it is a very popular place and always crowded," she says. (Thierry Marx isn't so sure. "It's too chic," he says.) I loved it. The sardinettes served in a tin were beautifully sweet, and I have never seen shepherd's pie on a Paris menu before. It's lovely to sit outside on a warm day and enjoy the pitchers of cocktails and the reasonably priced wine list.
Daily dishes are listed on a blackboard at this unfussy 17th arrondissement bistrot of French chef Ludovic Dubois, who returned to Paris after 13 years in Spain. There are Catalan influences at work in the cooking of this protégé of Michel Rostang
 who is a fan: "It's a real Parisian bistrot: Every dish is mouth-watering."
This bistrot in the south of Paris serves simple, well-prepared food at very reasonable prices. A dish of pork terrine is placed at the center of the table before you even order. The set-price menu is 37 euros for three courses, including options such as a starter of seafood risotto and a main of roast duck breast with black pepper and candied turnips. "This is traditional bourgeois cuisine at its very best," Pierre Koffmann says. "The ambience is fantastic: It is very busy and very French."
This bistrot in the 17th has a contemporary minimalist look, while Christophe Saintagne's cooking is modern and ambitious. The short menu features creative dishes such as 
featuring pork belly and boudin noir with edible sand with seafood (24 euros). It's a favourite of Alain Ducasse. "If I say that Papillon is a Parisian absolute must-go venue, it’s not because Christophe worked with me for more than 15 years," Ducasse says. "His cuisine is altogether contemporary and elegant, with a touch of humor that makes it an exciting experience. An example? The 'Free-range Pig Visiting Utah Beach,' pork from the South-west prepared with oysters and whelks from Normandy, Christophe’s native region."  
is another fan. "Papillon is both chic and classic, with refined plates and flavors,"  he says.
 

=== Title: Drink Like a Jetson: Automate Your Home Bar With Mixology Technology - Bloomberg ===

Drinking is hard work.
There's all that mixing, bottle-opening, and pouring. Luckily, the distance between us and a blissful 
-like future of automated imbibing is quickly closing. Whether you want a robot to mix you a Manhattan when you get home from that grueling desk job or a Japanese-invented contraption to sculpt the perfect ice sphere for your rare whisky, it's all doable. Some of these inventions can be in your kitchen tomorrow, while others require a little waiting. Either way, the future of inebriation is here.
Of the many cocktail mixing machines out there—yeah, there are a bunch, surprisingly not 
 in Skymall or the Hammacher Schlemmer catalog—
 is the only one I'd want to surround with my house guests. Six pods hold your spirits and mixers, and the entire contraption is controlled with an app on your phone or tablet. Drinks are fully mixed and chilled in the Somabar before being dispensed into the proper cocktail glass. There's even a special bitters infuser to keep your cocktail snob friends from sneering.
 
Maybe you're not much of a cocktail person and you're looking for a 
 to drink instead. With the 
, you can make your own. The self-contained brewing machine eliminates the clumsy mix of kettles, tubes, and fermenters that you traditionally need to home brew. It handles whole hops and malt, so you're not limited to extracts and concentrates, either. Best part: You can program it with recipes from the Web and take all the credit when your friends love the suds. 
 
If you own a Sodastream, you've definitely played the "let me see if I can carbonate that" game—and then blown up your machine. (Don't lie: been there, done that, and no, the wine stains didn't come out.) Luckily the engineers at Sodastream are as bubble-obsessed as you. Behold, the 
. With a beautiful touch interface, the Mix lets you program the on-demand carbonator to put just the right amount of fizz into whatever you want to carbonate. Turn a bottle of white wine into makeshift Champagne or a Martini into, well, a sparkling Martini. Let the fun begin. 
 
The days of having to laboriously fill plastic cups with a slurry of powder and vodka hours before guests arrive are almost behind us: 
 is an on-demand maker of Jello shots. It's a simple idea, albeit one that 
 to create. The commercial version will crank out 20 chilly Jello shots from a mixture of booze, water, and Jevo's flavor pods in 10 minutes. The 
 is sleek-looking, and while the website markets it primarily as a way to make gelatin snacks for your kids, we know you'll have more fun using it for yourself.  
Leave it to Japan to take something like drinking a glass of whisky and turn it into an art. Chilling whisky with spheres of clear ice, instead of quickly frozen cubes, has been popular there for more than a decade—and ubiquitous at most any high-end cocktail bar. Why? Less surface area means more chill and less dilution. Now you can bring that cocktail cred home with 
, with no carving technique required. You load a chunk of ice and the steel and aluminum press turns it into a perfect sphere. It might seem basic, but this is a serious piece of machinery. Just look at that carrying case. 
 
You can now breathe your cocktail instead of drinking it—and you don't even have to go to 
. 
 lets you heat up an ounce or two of your spirit of choice and sip the vapor with a straw. The set up is pretty simple: a glass globe sitting on top of a pint glass with a tea light candle. It's a lower-tech (and less impressive) version of the 
, but the latter doesn't seem to be for sale any more. The Vaportini website contains some faux scientific hokum; ignore it and just enjoy your cocktail vapor.

And with Giorgio Armani’s black-clad bow at the end of the catwalk at Teatro Armani, that’s a wrap on

Despite the plethora of beautiful, memorable looks and collections, the autumn/winter 2016 season will easily be remembered as the one a 21-year-old Internet sensation named 
 (go ahead, Google him) overshadowed a collective industry by just … showing up. The California native’s attendance at the Calvin Klein show caused such pandaemonium (think: Beatlesmania for the über-savvy You Tube generation), the likes of which not even hardcore fashion veterans had ever seen before (
). Needless to say, we admittedly may not have known who the heck this kid was four days ago, but we certainly do now.
And while we may still be talking about our near trampling as we exited Italo Zucchelli’s Nordic-chic Calvin show, there is indeed plenty to talk about the fashions. Such as how a lot of menswear designers are 
 trying to make fur happen, or the near-perfectness of such collections as

=== Title: The Finest Afternoon Teas in London, as Selected by a Pastry Maestro - Bloomberg ===

Afternoon tea is one of the most cherished treats that London has to offer. It's popular with both locals and tourists, attracted by a slice of tradition that recalls a bygone age. 
But where to go? I tried three of the most celebrated afternoon teas in the company of Hideko Kawa, former head pastry chef at the 
 and at Gordon Ramsay, each with three Michelin stars. She's the maestro other chefs go to to perfect their desserts, and well-placed to judge a perfectly crafted pastry. 
Our quest for London's finest started at 10 a.m. when the Ritz opened early to accommodate her. Here's how it went.
The setting is the 
, one of the most beautiful rooms in London. This historic salon, with its high ceilings, large mirrors and cool marbled floors is the height of luxury and yet every detail of the design is in the very best of taste.
This is the home of the most celebrated afternoon tea in London, possibly the world. Although there are five seatings – starting at 11:30 a.m. – and more than 400 guests a day, 
 recommends booking three months in advance.
There are five types of sandwich, including Scottish smoked salmon, with lemon butter on rye bread; plain and fruit scones with Cornish clotted cream and strawberry preserve; and a selection of pastries and cakes.
"This is very beautiful and traditional," Kawa says, casting a critical eye over the food and approving of details such as the perfect shape of the scones and the thickness of the sandwiches, whose bread she describes as moist and fluffy.
"The baking is very good: Look how neat and colorful and beautiful everything looks," she says. "This is amazing. The style is classic and yet everything tastes light and fresh.
"This is something special and gorgeous. It's not reality. It's like a trip to a dream world. I'd like to bring my mother here from Japan. She would love it."
Tea is served in the 
, which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. It is an elegant space, the pastel shades picked out by light that floods in from large windows.
The finger sandwiches include rare-breed hen egg with chopped chive, and coronation chicken. There are plain and fruit scones with Somerset clotted cream. There are individual patisseries at the tables as well as a cake trolley from which slices are served.
"The scones are really good," Kawa says. "The cake is beautifully layered and very neat. There's a skilled pastry chef here. And I like the room: It's light and beautiful. I can imagine bringing a group of friends here to enjoy it."
She remarks again on the quality of the cakes. Where some chefs take a short cut with sugar paste that looks attractive but doesn't taste very good, here the preparation is thoughtful and things taste as good as they look.
But there are reservations. The sandwiches are under-seasoned and not big on flavor. And the jam, which does taste good, comes out of a jar. That jar is jammed into one tier of a stand in which it barely fits. So Fortnum's loses ground for its over-polite sandwiches and its freshly unscrewed jam.
Afternoon tea is served in the 
, a large, high-ceilinged room, its pink walls filled with artworks by 
. The room is filled with women. It's all a big change from five years ago: then, tea was served to a few people in the much-smaller Parlour. Now, the Gallery is packed.
The tea has changed too. Before, it was fun and quite good. Now, it is strikingly attractive, and you can quickly tell how much thought has gone into the flavors, temperatures and textures of each element, including the scones, which are warm.
One of the sandwiches comes topped with a quail egg and caviar; the cucumber and ricotta one comes with the cucumber thinly sliced on top of the bread, so you can smell it before you bite into it and discover that it is perfectly crunchy. There's cherry roux; and peach-and-lemon verbena cheesecake.
"This is amazing," Kawa says. "Everything is so cute and different. It's a very original presentation. It's really special, absolutely divine. It's modern and fashionable and there's great attention to detail. Everything is delicious."
So it's a dead heat between traditional and funky. It looks like a meal known for finger sandwiches also has legs.

=== Title: How to Drink Grenache and Which Bottles You Should Buy - Bloomberg ===

There’s no movie— yet—with a guy rhapsodizing over a glass of grenache the way Miles (Paul Giamatti) crooned his love of pinot noir in wine buddy film 
. 
But grenache is having its moment now, thanks to a bunch of talented young winemakers with a new vision of how enticing these red wines can be. 
“They’re generous, happy wines, just delicious. They say, 'drink me,'” says Carla Rzeszewski, former wine director at April Bloomfield’s Spotted Pig group. 
The best have some of pinot’s seductive pleasure at a cheaper price. Juicy and soft, bursting with heady aromas, lively fruit, and a little minerality, they can suck you in with their supersexy silk and velvet textures.
Which is why Rzeszewski and her boyfriend. Richard Betts, a master sommelier, decided on grenache as the first wine they’re producing together. Their 2014 Sucette will be released this month. 
I didn’t used to be much of a grenache fan (with a handful of exceptions) because until recently, the grape was mostly hidden in blends or made into overripe alcoholic bruisers loaded with oak. But in the past few years, the new generation of subtler, lighter, pinot-style examples, such as Sucette, changed my mind. 
Here’s the backstory. The red version of grenache (there’s a white, too) is one of the world’s most widely planted red grapes. It flourishes in regions from Australia, to California, to South Africa, and it’s an eco-superstar that can withstand droughts. 
In Spain, where it’s called garnacha, it’s a huge deal, as it is in France, where it’s the main varietal in great southern Rhône valley blends. Oddly, only a few wines in the Rhône, such as the legendary Château Rayas, are pure grenache. (Unfortunately, Rayas, a favorite of mine, costs about $300 a bottle.) 
Elsewhere, few took the grape as seriously as that other Rhône varietal, syrah. 
Why? Well, like pinot noir, grenache is highly sensitive to where it’s grown and how it’s made. As Rzeszewski points out, soil “matters a ton” to whether it turns out simple or sublime. Ditto climate and altitude.
Vines planted on sand, as they are at Rayas, give fresher, lighter wines with more aromas; those on red clay have longer flavors and more structure. If the vines are very old, you get reds with more intense flavor. 
In Spain, the new look at grenache started in the 1990s in mountainous Priorat—but the lighter, more aromatic style was pioneered there only a decade ago. 
Today’s insider Spanish hot spot is Gredos, an area in the cool, rugged Sierra de Gredos mountain range about 40 miles from Madrid, where tiny plots of old bush vines planted on granite and sand flourish at elevations up to 3,000 feet. Two years ago, Daniel Ramos of Finca Zerberos helped pull together Garnachas de Gredos, an association of 18 vintners who focus on the grape. Among them are 30-somethings Daniel Landi and Fernando Garcia, founders of Comando G winery, named for a Japanese superhero cartoon. 
Many new grenache makers borrow winemaking techniques used for pinot noir, such as throwing whole clusters of grapes, even stems, into the fermentation tank to add complexity and spiciness to the wine.
Stellar grenache is also on the rise big time in Washington State and California, with dozens of bottlings now labeled with the grape's name.  Adventurous winemakers started planting it in cool coastal and mountain areas and discovered hidden historic sandy-soil vineyards in Sonoma, Santa Barbara, the Sierra Foothills, and the Central Coast. 
Rzeszewski and Betts looked in Spain and California but fell for a tiny parcel of ancient grenache vines growing in sandy soil that they discovered on a trip to Australia’s Barossa Valley. That was it.
The Sucette label underscores its mellow deliciousness by sporting a picture of soft-focus, slightly open red lips. (Too bad the name, which means lollipop, echoes Rouge Sucette, a yucky French red flavored with cola that hit the shelves two years ago.) 
 “We’re looking to make things that help people relax and make every day kick ass,” Rzeszewski laughs. “That’s grenache.”  
Here are eight of the best from new players:
Angela Osborne has been a one-woman grenache show since her 2008 vintage; she makes several subtle bottlings (including a rosé) that all have a cult following. 
Satisfying and subtle, this wine comes from 100-year-old vines grown in sandy soils in Sonoma. Aging in concrete eggs enhances its floral aromas and bright red berry flavors. 
Made since 2008, this wine has bright strawberry and raspberry fruit flavors and aromas and reminds me of serious Beaujolais. 
The price is too high, but the first vintage of this gulp-me-now wine is well worth tasting. It’s juicy and soft, with sweet fruit and a mineral undertone.  
The winery’s entry-level grenache is a blend from organic vineyards and tastes like a fruity, spicy cross between the Rhône Valley and Beaujolais. 
Light and fruity, with peppery notes, this elegant wine from Gredos has plenty of sophistication for the price. Daniel Landi also makes three single-vineyard wines. 
Daniel Ramos makes this lavender and herb-scented wine from 80-year-old vines growing on granite and slate in Gredos. 
OK, this deep, velvety wine is hardly a bargain. But it’s from a tiny high-altitude vineyard in Priorat, has vivid strawberry aromas, exotic spiciness, and the savor of great Burgundy.

=== Title: Master of Modern Chinese Cooking Shares a Few of His Secrets - Bloomberg ===

Walk down Wilton Road near Victoria station and you might easily miss 
, opposite Sainsbury's and just past Nando's.
That would be your loss. A. Wong is a remarkable restaurant, serving some of the most exciting Chinese food in the U.K. Chef Andrew Wong reveals a few of his secrets in his first cookbook, published this month.
There's a poignant story behind the family business.
Andrew Wong's dad owned the establishment from 1985, when it was a traditional Cantonese called Kym's. Mum ran the front of house. Wong and his sister spent much of their childhood playing and studying in the restaurant while their parents worked.
The younger Wong went to Oxford University and the London School of Economics. He never thought of becoming a chef until his father died, and he decided to learn to cook. He trained for four years at Westminster Kingsway, a college known for its culinary school, and then traveled across China, working in kitchens and attending 
.
He took over the restaurant and moved away from traditional Cantonese fare to a more creative style, refining dishes and focusing on regional cuisines. 
Pork and prawn dumpling is served with crackling for texture. Shanghai steamed dumpling is normally served with vinegar on the side to cut through the fat; here, ginger-infused vinegar is injected directly inside.
"There's very little I can do to mess with Shanghai dumplings except to make them well, because it's a perfect Chinese dish," Wong says. "A lot of places make a lot of them and corners get cut. We're very fortunate because we only have a 40-seater restaurant so every dumpling that gets served, it comes through me first. If there any blemishes, any holes, they go back."
"I always thought it was a bit strange having this pot of vinegar on the side and dipping into it. If you need vinegar, why not put it inside?  So we made a dumpling and injected it inside. When you actually eat it, it makes a big difference, because we know the correct ratio with the stock base."
The chef's formulas are revealed in "A. Wong, the Cookbook." It shows how to make dim sum and even contains his recipe for Peking duck, which took more than three years to develop.
"If you work in a kitchen in China, no chef will ever tell you his recipe for Peking duck," Wong says. "He might tell you 90 percent of it."
While he may give the recipe, there's one catch: Wong says it's almost impossible to make Peking Duck using a domestic oven because of the range of temperatures needed. And while he shares simple tips, Wong says he's more interested in helping diners to understand the complexity of Chinese cooking.
"Ken (Hom) writes amazing books on Chinese food made easy," he says. "That's great because it highlights Chinese cuisine. But the trade-off of that is that people in general now think that Chinese food is unskilled and almost simple to cook.
"I want to show people that it is quite technical and very refined. People go to Chinatown on a Sunday and order dim sum, but they don't think of the skill involved, in the way they might if they went to an Italian restaurant where they thought the guy was hand-making the pasta, hand-making the ravioli.
"That is just to do with preconceptions people in London have developed over the years. Chinese food has become part of British culture so Londoners have a childhood affinity to what they perceive to be Chinese food from when they grew up.
"London's Chinese food scene is defined by Cantonese cooking, purely because of immigrants in the 1970s all coming from Hong Kong. But now we are reaching a strange stage where Cantonese food is being cooked by Chinese people from other regions who may not understand cantonese food the way it originally was."
Don't be discouraged. Here are two recipes you 
 try at home.

=== Title: Cam Newton on His Personal Style, and How You Can Dress Better - Bloomberg ===

Despite team allegiances, we can all agree that NFL quarterback Cam Newton is an impressive human being. 
There’s his exceptional on-field heroism that has led the Carolina Panthers to a nearly perfect regular season (they are currently 14-1 after a recent tough loss to the Atlanta Falcons) and has made him a frontrunner to win the 2015 NFL Most Valuable Player award. And there’s his cyborg-like strength and stature. At 6’5” and 245 pounds, he’s more like a linebacker than a quarterback. Case in point: It took nearly the 
 to take him down during a run with the ball on Sunday.
There's also his exuberant (and sometimes controversial) persona and that endzone dance, "the Dab." And I haven’t even gotten to his style. Or the shoes. He favors bold accessories such as smoking slippers and … 
 That’s right, Newton has been known to tack on a 
 to the side of his skinny jeans before approaching the podium for a postgame press conference. There's a lot going on with this guy.
 
 
Before his unpredicted defeat this past weekend, we caught up with the effervescent Newton—who's always up for talking about style and his obsession with accessories—and quizzed him about dressing tips, skin care, and the continuation of his own clothing line with megaretailer 
. 
 Thanks! Yea, I really believe that fashion, and dressing up, is a great way for guys to express and interact with their creativity. One of my favorite looks of the past year came earlier in the season when I wore a navy/camo blazer to the postgame press conference. I’ve also enjoyed adding unexpected accessories—like a foxtail—from time to time to my more casual looks. I know it has taken some people by surprise … but I love that. I just like having fun with my style and keeping it new.
 I simply say, "I'm doing me." I'm expressing myself. Some people are afraid to dress in ways that they actually 
 because it might be different than what most people expect or how others dress. I say embrace being different. The way I represent my individuality is by mixing classic pieces—like sports jackets—with little, unexpected additions.  
 I just use good ol' soap. With three boys in the house, my mother was always on us when growing up about keeping our faces clean, washing behind our ears, and brushing our teeth. So I still take my morning routine seriously. I make sure to exfoliate well, and I like to use cocoa and shea butter body lotions to stay smooth.
 The line is evolving. We are listening to what the customer—who I call the southern man on the go—wants and needs, and we’re growing and designing the line around that feedback. My personal style is the cornerstone of the brand because I 
 the customer. I am a southern guy who likes dressing up and looking sharp but who lives a busy life of working and traveling, and I need reliable, stylish pieces in my wardrobe that will service multiple occasions. So I don’t come to the design table with Belk as a designer, but rather as a customer and a shopper. I always keep my eye focused on what I would and want to wear, and I share those ideas with Belk. 
 I’m always open to discussing collaborations. Some of the high-end designers I pay attention to and am interested in include Prada, Tom Ford, and Lanvin—I'm definitely a fan of their design techniques and the style trends they help create. So who's to say what collaborations could come down the road? But right now I am committed to my MADE line and seeing that continue to grow and develop.
 Absolutely. I love that the pricing of MADE allows a guy to purchase bigger, statement pieces and also mix and match key items—such as dress shirts and blazers—with items they already have in their closet. Most recently I have splurged on dress shoes, like slippers from 
 and 
. With no socks, of course.
 
 I think our league can clean up with the best of them. The NBA definitely has some trendsetters that stay up on the latest fashion, but I think you're starting to see guys like myself and others get some much-deserved respect in the style department. Just like the NBA, the NFL has guys that can pull off multiple looks, ranging from street style to more dapper, buttoned-up looks, and people are starting to notice. 
 I keep my eyes open. I pay attention to how different types of people express their personal style, how they put their clothes together. It’s no secret that I am not afraid to shine bright and be festive, and I like to encourage that in others.
My suggestion for a fast style upgrade would be to embrace a pop of color or pattern. Try layering a bright, pullover knit on top of a dress shirt with a subtle or bold pattern. Just make sure the pullover is not too baggy, that it has a nice fit, and that the shirt underneath it is tucked in. A guy could wear this look with or without a tie.
And good shoes—they're the ultimate finishing touch. In fact, we actually joke in my family that your shoes have to be shined before you can leave the house. 
 Yeah, I'm working. Since I'm still in season, it's hard to say what my actual plans will be—but likely something quiet with some family and close friends. But my no-fail outfit for New Year’s Eve would be a tailored jacket with a pair of tapered jeans, a crisp ironed shirt, tie optional, colorful V-neck sweater (purple is always nice on New Year's Eve), and some memorable dress shoes or loafers. Again: no socks. 
: As a team, we are just focused on the game that's immediately ahead of us. But make no mistake about it—we don't plan on being done any time soon. Some things money just can't buy, and the reward of accomplishing that ultimate goal* as a team would be better than anything I could ever purchase.

=== Title: Dóttir Is One of Berlin’s Best New Restaurants - Bloomberg ===

Victoria Eliasdóttir doesn’t waste time with a tiny amuse bouche, some delicate little bite to impress the pants off you and tease out what’s to come. No, the first thing that lands on the table when you sit down for dinner at her new restaurant, 
, is served with regular-size cutlery, generously portioned and satisfying. On a recent evening, it was a delicious pile of chicken salad, the meat in warm, tender pieces, embroidered with tarragon leaves and fat pickled cherries.
It was the kind of thing you’d nibble on some luxe family picnic, but Dóttir opened this past March in Mitte, a couple of blocks south of the Spree river in Berlin, in a crumbly old building that had been empty for the past three decades. Eliasdóttir, a Danish-born, Icelandic-raised chef, runs the small kitchen there, serving just one five-course set menu each night (€58), which she revises entirely each Tuesday.
On a recent evening, in the middle of a nasty heat wave, were pieces of soft, smoked mackerel and fresh cheese, with a little ceramic jug of cold tomato broth on the side—elegant and unfussy, each component buzzing with flavor. The dish seemed cool and effortless. Warm sourdough bread came with a bowl of melted brown butter to dip it in, and none of the servers seemed to mind that they had to wipe up everyone’s dribbles of butter across the wide bare wooden tables throughout the night.
The chef, who is 27, went to culinary school in Reykjavík and occasionally orders her seaweed and fish—a focus of the restaurant—from Iceland. But most of the seafood, including the juicy turbot I had with crisp skin and so many sweet green peas, comes from the Baltic Sea, just a few hours away by car. Like so many of Eliasdóttir’s dishes, it is simply but precisely composed, with a handful of ingredients and lots of attention to detail.
Dóttir translates from Icelandic to mean daughter. Eliasdóttir’s father was also a chef, in Copenhagen in the 1970s and ’80s. When the family moved to Iceland, he started to work on fishing ships, cooking for the crews of about 40 on board, leaving for one or two months at a time. When Eliasdóttir was 13, and her father passed away, she started to cook more herself—glazed ducks at Christmas, layered cakes on birthdays, always something celebratory, she says.
After culinary school, as the other students left to chase down high-profile internships, Eliasdóttir headed to Laugarvatn, a small lakeside town in southern Iceland where she jumped from being a student to suddenly running the kitchen in a hotel, cooking for a hundred people each day. She used trout from the lake and ordered tomatoes in from local farms. “It was a little bit in the Nordic in style, but at the same time I was letting my imagination go.”
That fall, Eliasdóttir headed to Berkeley for a four-month stint at Chez Panisse, jumping between stations, including pastry, and learning to butcher whole pigs, lambs, and various birds. “I got a little nerdy about the whole thing,” she says. By the time the chef got back to Iceland, her ambitions weren’t in fine dining any more. She moved to Berlin and cooked lunch daily at 
, her brother’s well-known art studio, until the offer came to run her own kitchen again.
The new dining room is beautiful, with stucco ceilings left raw and peeling, so they have the faded glamour of an old mansion that’s fallen on hard times. The handful of tables are spaced far apart (though on one night, some were pushed together for a birthday party of scruffy artists, half of whom were dressed in oversize striped shirts and ripped jeans) but close enough that you can still hear snippets of German, French, and English in many different accents.
Dinner goes so quickly, without feeling rushed, and every dish on a recent visit was delicious, right down to dessert: a hunk of frozen crème fraîche with a pool of salty caramel. (This week’s dessert is a mellow dill ice cream under a lemon and white chocolate mousse, with crisp sour raspberry meringues.) Dóttir, with its stylish dining room, warm service, and excellent, well-priced menu, may just be one the loveliest places to spend an evening in Berlin right now, the kind of place you could easily fit into your routine once a week and still never get the same thing twice.

=== Title: We Drank All 20 Cocktails at NYC’s Boozey Christmas Pop-Ups - Bloomberg ===

It’s officially time for holiday cheer—and lots of it. And by that, we mean cocktails.
Last year, New York's yet-to-open East Village bar 
 turned out a full Christmas-themed pop-up called 
, with creations by acclaimed bartender Nico de Soto. It was such a runaway success, with lines down the block and all the 
, the fact that they're back this year with even more kitschy décor and festive speciality cocktails is not a surprise. But turning nearby bar 
 (named for the beer-and-shot combo) into the more casual tiki-esque 
 as well? Well, we take that as a challenge. 
Here are all the drinks, drunk just for you, and ranked by their perceived booziness, how sweet they taste, and most important for a Christmas-themed bar, the level of cheer—for which we’re not awarding stars, but Santas. Scale: 1 is lowest (i.e. least strong/sweet/cheerful), 5 is highest (most strong/sweet/zomg).
Suffice to say spirits will be bright this holiday season, at least through Dec. 24, when both ventures close.
 
Lavish and festive, dripping with Christmas lights. No corner is left unadorned, from the snowflakes on the bar top, to the weird little Santa heads in jars, to wrapped “packages” spinning overhead. The “Hanukkah Hideaway” is back this year, too, a cozy little nook for the chosen peeps in back.
A dozen of 'em, as in the 12 Miracles of Christmas. Loyal customers will spot some of the spiced touches from Mace and a couple of favorites brought back from last year’s Miracle. In general, these are quite complicated cocktails, with lots of elaborate infusions and housemade ingredients. Don’t try this at home.
 
So it’s a Moscow Mule? “Yeah, sort of,” de Soto says. But instead of vodka, there’s aquavit. And instead of ginger beer, there’s ginger syrup and actual beer, plus a big piece of chewy candied ginger as garnish. The drink arrives in a tall glass with saucy 1950s-inspired Santa prints—Greg Boehm, a partner in both bars, custom-produced the glasses through his 
 barware enterprise, and you’ll find them at both joints.
 Linie aquavit, Oloroso sherry, ginger syrup, lime juice, pale ale

Given its really complicated list of ingredients, it’s refreshing to receive just a simple, smiley ceramic snowman mug (or you might get a Santa head instead) with a ring of leathery dried pineapple on top. The mug is almost too hot to handle, but it’s scented like cookie dough and warms all the way down to my toes.

De Soto plunks down a Bud can, with a devilish grin. What’s this? I’m confused. “Redneck Flip,” he replies. A-ha: They make a syrup using the beer. I can’t see what’s inside the metal can, but the egg and marshmallow make for a creamy, frothy, but not cloying sip. It doesn’t taste like beer at all; in fact, the fizzy Muletide was a lot more beer-like.
Bourbon, Applejack, Budweiser-marshmallow syrup, beef jerky bitters, egg

It’s simple, it’s spare, and it’s low-alcohol, unlike most gimlets. Even the garnish is minimalist: just a single thin pine needle. I want to sip on this crisp drink all night—and it’s a nice palate cleanser after the creamy flip.
 Shochu, pine needle cordial, grapefruit oil

All that cocoa and spice—it’s like sipping on cold hot cocoa, with a vague nuttiness that provides additional interest to an otherwise standard nog. 
 Brown butter fat-washed cognac, Amontillado sherry, pandan syrup, egg, hazelnut milk, clove, nutmeg

I dip my nose into the rocks glass—and it smells a bit like peaty Scotch. “That’s the Frankincense smoke,” says De Soto. It’s a rye whiskey drink that’s a dead ringer for Scotch, thanks to that smokiness and a chocolaty undertone. I’m loving this one, and I’m not at all surprised to find out it’s Miracle’s best-selling drink. (And no, there's a bit of umami but you can't taste the fish sauce.)
Rye whiskey, Pedro Ximenez, nuoc mam (a Vietnamese fish sauce), pine bitters, frankincense smoke

It’s a Cosmo, all right—though the flavors are a bit more nuanced than your standard 
 sipper. There’s a lot of fruit flavors going on in this glass. It’s vibrant pink, it’s dangerously tasty, and easy-drinking.
Fig leaf-infused vodka, St. Germain, lime juice, spiced cranberry sauce

It’s like the best Mimosa you’ve ever had, with subtle burst of mint. But really, it’s all about the tiny, adorable candy cane balanced on top of the glass, which I immediately pocket.

Another sessionable low-alcohol drink, made with three types of fortified wine (PX sherry, Madeira, and sweet vermouth), with a foamy egg white cap for a two-tone effect and a star anise garnish. It’s like sipping on a creamy-soft cloud—of wine.
 Pedro Ximenez, Madeira, sweet vermouth, orange acid, star anise and clove syrup, egg

This one's for the tribe. And it smells and tastes like chocolate gelt. The drink is garnished with a little plastic dreidel; last year, it was garnished with chocolate coins. “Greg wouldn’t let me do it this year because I ate them all,” de Soto amiably grumbles. “It’s true,” Boehm confirms. “I’d come in and find all the little gold wrappers."

Look, if you’re ordering this drink, you’re probably more interested in gleefully hollering the name down the bar than what’s inside that ceramic mug shaped like a mitten. So here’s the scoop: It’s a refreshing tiki drink, thanks to that rum and “roasted chestnut” orgeat (instead of the traditional almond). Even that powdered sugar-dusted mint nosegay on top is a tiki garnish cleverly disguised as snow-covered greenery.

The last drink of the set: What it is? It’s cinnamon-scented ... it’s creamy ... it’s really complicated chocolate milk. I was hoping it would be a bit more like gingerbread based on the description, but it’s still a pleasingly sweet libation.
 Gingerbread Calvados, spiced pumpkin syrup, egg, olive oil, cinnamon

 Where Miracle is baroque and fancy, Sippin’ Santa is chill and tropical, with palm trees decked with lights, flamingoes, and bamboo strategically strewn. If Santa had a slightly loopy tiki bar in his basement, this would be it. Think Beach Boys and Elvis at Christmas time—kitschy touches include a surfboard twined with lights and a Santa doll in a tropical shirt. Just go with it.
 Eight easy-sipping, tropical-inspired drinks with a twist. In addition to the cocktails, look for a selection of boilermakers (beer and a shot combination) made with Christmas-themed brews, lest you forget where you are.
 
An enticing clove scent pulls you in the second that cute Santa mug hits the bar. Basically, it’s a really delicious mulled wine extra fortified with brandy, and it will be perfect if it ever snows again.

It’s spiced egg nog. Not much more to say about the drink itself, except that it’s surprisingly challenging to order after you’ve had a couple of rounds. To be honest, I was more focused on the awesome reggae version of 
 that was playing. Give us some figgy pudding, mon.

Basically, it’s a Grasshopper. Or maybe it’s a cross between an alcoholic milkshake and a Girl Scouts Thin Mint cookie. Either way, it goes down dangerously easily, and I quickly handed my glass over to a friend before I sucked back the whole drink.
Vodka, grapefruit juice, Branca Menta, Hershey’s syrup, chocolate bitters, with mint

It’s a true tiki drink. Meaning it’s strong, sweet, and you’ll never guess what’s in there unless someone tells you. It also arrives with what seems to be an entire bunch of mint as a lavish crown for the wineglass.

Yes, it’s made with Jäger. Get over it. Presented in a frosty silver julep mug, the drink has a tropical feel to it, with lots of tart lime and spice, and would be great for summertime sipping.

I had assumed this would be a pine-y gimlet, but that’s my own fault for not reading the menu description more carefully. Or waiting till my 19th drink to try this. Whatever. Here’s what it really is: a refreshing gin and tonic with a bit of Christmas tree actually tucked into the tall glass.

=== Title: Solla Eiríksdóttir New Cookbook, Raw, and Recipes - Bloomberg ===

Solla Eiríksdóttir is one celebrity chef you may not have come across, but she is a household name in Iceland because of  her TV shows and four restaurants focused on raw food and vegan dishes.
If such an approach sounds a little purist, Solla, 55,  is more interested in flavor than philosophy, and she laughs a lot during an interview at 
restaurant in Reykjavik. Sitting alongside is daughter Hildur, 36, the collaborator on her first English-language cookbook, "
," which will be published by Phaidon on May 4.
"It's a way of preparing food, not a way of life," she says. "Everywhere in the world, people are told to eat more fruit and vegetables. What we're doing is transforming fruit and vegetables into real dishes instead of just making salad all the time. This is just food.

Solla is an interesting story. She was studying handicrafts in Copenhagen when Hildur was born. Her doctor told her to stop breast-feeding so he could prescribe drugs for her allergies. She said no, and on the way home stopped at a health-food store for the first time.
She met a nutritionist who put her on a vegan diet that cleared up her allergies in six months. Solla returned to Reykjavik, studying at the

She went on to open her first restaurant with a friend in March 1994, selling it a decade later and going to study at the

Solla currently owns four restaurants in Iceland and is now looking at expanding her Gló street-food concept internationally. She mentions London, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo as possible cities, along with California and Germany. She also has her own organic food brand and has published five cookbooks in Iceland.
She wrote the book with Hildur so the mother and daughter could spend more time together. They also write a blog. There are 75 recipes, all vegetarian and many raw and vegan. I've rarely been so excited by meat-free recipes. Here are some to try.
Do not let the long list of ingredients discourage you - this is really a very simple recipe. Falafel is exceptionally good in a cooked wrap or romaine lettuce with some homemade fermented carrots, sesame seed sauce, and fresh vegetables, such as ripe tomatoes, onions, and cucumber. The sauce is great for falafel and salad.

=== Title: Jason Atherton London Restaurant Sosharu Is His Best for Years - Bloomberg ===

There's a theory that Jason Atherton is expanding his dining empire so quickly that standards must drop and creativity wane.
That's a load of rubbish. 
, the chef's new London restaurant, is the most exciting since his first, 
which opened in 2011.
Atherton is certainly going for it. He owns seven establishments in London, three in Hong Kong, two in Shanghai and one each in New York, Sydney and Dubai. He plans to open 
, in London's Victoria, later this year as well as a neighborhood joint in Cebu, in the Philippines, the homeland of his wife, Irha.
At that rate of international expansion, you might think Atherton would have nothing left up his sleeve other than a Rolex and lucrative TV deals. His former mentor Gordon Ramsay has followed that particular path with gusto.
But 
 shows a burst of creative energy, starting with the fact it's an 
Atherton's first stab at Japanese cuisine. As bright ideas go, that is up there with a karaoke drunk attempting Amy Winehouse or 
going for Olympic gold - enterprises that leave you flat on your face.
Not here. Much of the credit must go to executive chef 
 Atherton's protégé spent years at restaurants in Japan learning about ingredients, cooking techniques and flavors. 
That knowledge has created dishes that are modern and avoid the 
template of black cod and sushi. Sosharu actually brings something new to a city that is almost saturated with restaurant concepts.
Assuming you don't immediately head downstairs to the 
 cocktail bar, with its Japanese pop iconography, the meal may start with sashimi. Just don't expect a pot of soy sauce and a dollop of wasabi.
Each fish is individually dressed and seasoned, from the sesame-topped salmon through the o-toro fatty tuna with a slither of eight-month pickled garlic through to the hamachi yellowtail with ginger and lime juice.
It doesn't come cheap: a selection is £22 ($31.60) for six pieces and £35 for 10. If you have my kind of appetite, it's easy to spend more than £50 a head on food at Sosharu before you go near wagyu beef or sake.
But it's good enough to keep going back.
The outstanding dishes include a reasonably priced avocado tempura at £6. The batter is light and crisp, the avocado oily rich. It is served with lemon salt and a light dashi soy, along with creamy Kewpie mayonnaise and roast pineapple. It's crunchy and gooey with the texture of a chocolate egg and sweet-and-sour flavors like a posh Chinese takeaway that's been to finishing school.
The chicken yakitori (£18) features rice cooked in a chicken stock, with ground cartilage for crunch, plus negi onions, garlic and egg for flavor. It's topped with tsukune chicken sausage and a shishito pepper to balance the sweetness and richness of the rice.
And I wouldn't miss the scallop tartare, with fresh peas, sesame and lemon puree (£13). It is a beautiful dish that, like so much on the menu, combines contrasting tastes and textures in a dish that's great to look at as well as to eat.
Mixed Japanese mushrooms (maitake, shimeji, shiitake, enoki, king oyster) with crunchy toasted buckwheat (£11) are another winner. Desserts include 
shaved ice with different flavorings including rhubarb, hibiscus and mocha.
Not everything works equally well. On a couple of dishes, the seasoning is a bit too subtle: I didn't really get the chewy chicken skin from the hibachi grill and I didn't dare to order the wagyu sirloin from Miyazaki prefecture at £40 per 100 grams. (I had a taste and I'm worried that I may be hooked). I'm assuming the whole menu will slim down over time, gaining focus. You can see Craciun in the open kitchen, obsessing over everything.
I'm quite happy staying unfocussed, ordering a few dishes and looking out across the room, dominated by an abstract timber structure inspired by a traditional Japanese house - a crowded house as it turns out in the opening weeks of Sosharu.  The designs are by the Shanghai-based studio 
, which was also responsible for Pollen Street Social.
Service is both disarmingly friendly and scarily well-informed, like having the girl or boy next door sharing detailed thoughts on Japanese ingredients and cooking techniques while you are just struggling to pronounce words like 
and wondering if 
is a snake or an Indian beer. (It's actually a fish, but you probably knew that.)
If this is Atherton spreading himself thin, who needs a fat chef?

=== Title: Tired of Rose? Eight Great Other Wines to Drink in the Summer Sun - Bloomberg ===

In the world of wine, rosé has come to 
 like a clingy neighbor on your chaise lounge.
Stroll into any summer yard party, outdoor wedding, or lawn concert, check out the wine glasses held in manicured hands, and you’ll see more pink than at a prep school reunion.
Now, nothing against rosé per se. 
. But those bracingly crisp bottles from Provence and quality Spanish rosados are often lost in a salmon-colored sea of insipid, consumer-baiting quaffers chosen more on price than merit. “$9.99? I’ll take three!” When summer ends, the rosé craze is packed away until next year. It’s Beaujolais Nouveau, déjà vu.
In terms of taste—in both its forms—breaking the mold with good wine always beats going with the flow of mediocre bottles. Delicious white wines, born for summer refreshment, huddle on shelves in favor of mass-produced rosés that bring little to a perspiring party, aside from a splash of color.
And who ever said you can’t drink Cabernet Sauvignon in summer? Certainly, 100-degree, prison-riot heat and an inky-rich, alcohol-laced red aren’t the ideal combination. But there’s a vast, wonderful world of lighter, fresher reds that remains largely overlooked as the mercury climbs. They occupy a sliding scale of familiarity, from trusty Pinot Noir to Italy’s fast-rising Barbera from the towns of Alba or Asti.
Well, enough of the seasonal monomania. Carve out a space for these warm-weather bottles farther along the color spectrum, most party-friendly at under $20. Just keep that pesky neighbor from guzzling more than his share.
Spain’s ancient Rueda region has staged a comeback on par with that of Matthew McConaughey. Its spotlight shines on the white verdejo grape (pronounced “ver DAY ho”) whose sassy, citrusy flavors—largely at bottom shelf prices—allow you to crack open a second bottle with zero guilt. The Bodegas Naia is a signature rendition of the palate-pleasing style, and it's a top value. 
Tired of same-old Chardonnay? Drink Chablis instead—and not the generic box swill that has sullied the Chablis name. The (relatively) affordable expression of Chardonnay in France’s Burgundy is the ideal splurge to elevate your best seafood dishes: Its incredible stony, briny seashell flavors are distinctive to Chablis and exactly no place else. Founded in Maligny in 1984 by husband and wife Olivier and Francine Savary, Domaine Savary produces a quintessential hierarchy of Petit Chablis, Chablis, and Chablis Premier Cru, including the midpriced Vielles Vignes. 
For red wine lovers, a change to shorts and loafers often means a switch to equally lighter-bodied but still luscious Pinot Noir. But finding reasonably priced examples of this famously delicate, low-yield grape has become a quest. The quaint Santa Rita Hills, north of Santa Barbara, Calif., became a hotbed after its star turn in the movie 
, yet its rich-and-structured Pinots remain a good deal, compared with Napa-Sonoma. That deal gets even better from Cameron Hughes, the innovative American 
 who cuts deals with top growers to produce his cost-cutting wines: Sourced from extreme, windswept sites above the Santa Ynez River, the Lot 505 is a $25 Pinot that drinks like a $40 bottle, a brawny, leather-scented hunk infused with ripe plum and blueberry. 
Riesling is another wine that’s been unfairly slagged in some quarters. But give good Riesling a chance and you’ll be invited to a perfect summer marriage of dry and sweet—but still snappy and acidic, not cloying like so much rosé. Whether from Germany’s Mosel River or the Alsace in France, Riesling also cools the palate to pair beautifully with spicy backyard food. St. Urbans-Hof’s Mosel is a lip-smacking blend of honeyed apricot, floral, and raisin flavors, elegant and just a touch sweet. 
If French Sancerre is too expensive to pour poolside, shoot east across the Loire River for Pouilly-Fumé, the more accessible take on sprightly Sauvignon Blanc. The “Fumé” translates to “smoke,” referring to the gunflint aroma that wafts from the local wines. That mineral complexity stands in contrast to the full-on lemon-lime attack of New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs. Cedrick Bardin’s version is as bright and balanced as a Motown harmony, with grass and grapefruit flavors. 
The Barbera grape, finally escaping the shadow of kingly, Nebbiolo-based Barolos and Barberescos of Italy’s Piedmont region, is one of my favorite summer reds: bright, ruby-red and tannic, with a brash acidity that slices through barbecue and other rich foods. But with big name Barberas from Alba or Asti shooting to $30 and more, Cantine Sant’Agata’s “Baby” is delicious and affordable enough to delight an army of thirsty guests. 
The hills are definitely alive in the Alto Adige, Italy’s northernmost growing region in the limestone-rich Dolomites, whose wines reflect the region’s effortless blending of German and Italian culture. Erste + Neue, an up-and-coming wine collective, makes some dandies, including a straw-yellow Pinot Bianco (or Weissburgunder 
that’s all herbs and Granny Smith apples, a mountain meadow in a glass. 
Summer weddings and celebrations may call for champagne, but not necessarily at $100 a literal pop. Enter the Jura, a once-isolated backwater near the Swiss border in France, which makes some of the world’s most distinctive and unusual wines. “Crémant” designates seven French sparkling wines grown outside of Champagne, including Crémant du Jura, classified only since 1995 and made from at least 70 percent Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Trousseau. The Tissot family’s deep-gold sparkler is a steal at $25, a yeasty burst of lively bubbles, tangy fruit, and a dry backbone. Flattered guests will whisper that you broke the bank on vintage champagne. Let them. 

=== Title: Former Wall Street Exec to Sell Unparalleled Burgundy Collection - Bloomberg ===

Don Stott got the tip that pushed him into serious wine collecting in 1963, when most Americans thought high-end drinking meant soaking up very dry martinis.
At New York’s 21 Club, where Stott had often eaten with his parents, then head sommelier Mario Ricci advised him to buy cases of 1961 Bordeaux. The 24-year-old Stott listened and purchased. He still has some 1961 Château Mouton Rothschild.
But on a trip to Europe soon after, he had a “conversion” to Burgundy. Over the next 50 years he built one of the world’s great collections of the region’s seductive reds and whites. He was savvier than he imagined at the time. If you look at a list of the most expensive wines in the world today, the majority of them are from Burgundy.
This year he put thousands of cases on the block at Sotheby’s in New York. Part one, last spring, brought in $8,412,626.
Now, on Dec. 4 and 5, it’s time for 
.
Stott jokingly calls the two sales “my retirement account.”
Well, only sort of. He also spent decades on Wall Street, mostly at the New York Stock Exchange specialist firm his father co-founded, Wagner Stott Mercator. He and his partners sold it to Bear Stearns in early 2001 for more than $625 million.
I first met Stott at New York’s biannual Burgundy bash, La Paulée. He’d brought very rare jeroboams (the equivalent of 4 bottles) of 1964 and 1969 La Tâche to share ($12,000 and $8,000–$15,000 at auction, respectively). 
At its peak, his collection included about 120,000 bottles.
So how did he amass such a stellar cellar? He puts it down to passion, mentors, contacts, relationships, and persistence, plus he was collecting during a period when only a few connoisseurs had their eyes on Burgundy rather than Bordeaux. “When everyone else was focused on one thing, I looked elsewhere,” he said. (Where would he look now for wines that aren’t so expensive? “Pinot from Oregon,” he said, “They’re very good, very elegant. I’m already buying some made by Dominique Lafon.”)
Money was the least of it, at the beginning.
“My passion for wine first started at Princeton,” he recalls. “I drank beer until it bored me. Then, in my junior year, I discovered Blue Nun. I served it with caviar and cream cheese on crackers.”
He began haunting Princeton’s wine shops, tasting, learning, buying.
The trip to Europe—Stott sailed over on the famous ocean liner, 
 with his best friend—was an important milestone. (A bottle of Château Lafite cost 10 francs, less than breakfast, he recalls.)
A family friend, Olivier LeBas, a French war hero and bon vivant, shepherded them through Burgundy and became another mentor. “Just remember the names of Domaine de la Romanée Conti and de Vogue” was his advice. So Stott started at the top and found the pinot noir grape spoke to him.
“It was the aroma that got me,” he says. “And the wines are not as dry as Bordeaux. Even the Bordeaux I like resemble Burgundies.” (Château Pétrus is one of them.)
Getting his hands on many of the wines wasn’t easy. “In those days very few Burgundies were available in the U.S.,” he says. “I mostly had to rely on the basic gold standard—wines from negociants Drouhin and Jadot—and collected their grands crus.”
New York sommeliers turned him on to DRC’s Le Montrachet. By the 1980s he was visiting Burgundy regularly, being introduced to growers whose wines he respected, and was often invited to dine in their homes. Winemakers he befriended introduced him to others. Going further afield led him to Anne Gros and others who later became well known.
“That exposure was important,” he says. “What really grabbed me were the people. Burgundy is like peeling an onion. You think you understand on the first layer, then see you really didn’t.” He bought through brokers, feeling it would be inappropriate to ask producers to sell directly to him.
Stott spent so much time in Burgundy that he invested in part ownership of L’Hôtel in Beaune, a small, elegant hostelry with a tiny bistro, where he often staged wine dinners. And he would often open bottles in the lounge or courtyard and share them with whomever wandered by. Among his faves are Chambolle Musigny, Romanée-St.-Vivant, La Tâche, and Musigny from Roumier (the 2005 vintage of the last one is now worth about $9,000 a bottle).
Meanwhile, Stott’s day job (he’s also been a director of the New York Stock Exchange) took most of his time, and when he wasn’t trading, he was sport fishing. After the sale of his company, he says, wine became No. 1.
Even for a megacollector, the purchase path hasn’t always been smooth. At an auction in 2006, he snagged some bottles of Roumier wines that had been consigned by now-convicted fraudster Rudy Kurniawan. A year later, Stott staged a tasting of them and invited Christophe Roumier. “They were fakes,” Stott says. “I returned them and went to the FBI.”
Last May, Sotheby’s New York auction room was packed with wine advisers such as Tim Kopec, who was buying for clients in Asia. Bidders called in from Hong Kong, Brazil, Mexico, and Canada. The top bid was $58,188, paid by an Asian private collector for a case of DRC Montrachet 1973.

=== Title: A Critic’s Last Look at the Four Seasons and Brasserie - Bloomberg ===

The 
 was New York’s hottest restaurant in the summer of 1959, with an opening cost of $4.5 million. It was one of the first to change its entire menu with the seasons—a theme restaurant devised by relentless hitmaker Joe Baum—and this menu wasn’t classic French but extravagant, modern New American. Before the end of the year, Craig Claiborne called it “the most exciting restaurant to open in New York within the last two decades.”
It’s not so exciting any more, but every now and then I meet someone’s grandma who goes there once a fortnight after a blowout, a couple that goes back each year for an anniversary, or a power lunch enthusiast with love for the Grill Room. I went to the Four Seasons last week for the very first time, knowing that real estate investor Aby Rosen wouldn’t be renewing the lease next year and that in a few months, one of the city’s most famous restaurants would have to pack it in. 
Tableside service is still emphasized, but it's clumsy. The steak tartare was overmixed on a trolley, then presented in a dark, dangerous-looking puddle, the color of a fresh wound. It tasted exclusively of Tabasco. The caviar cost $190, and nobody knew where it came from. "Not Iran,” said the waiter, "Not Russia. Maybe somewhere in Europe?" This seemed highly unlikely. In any case, the caviar was a vaguely fishy mush. And the potato rosti underneath it simulated the texture of frozen hash browns but with the granular, thickly crisp exterior of a tater tot.
The food that followed wasn’t great, either—both pheasant and monkfish were dry and overcooked. So why, exactly, was I having such a wonderful time? It must have been the wave of fine golden chains suspended along the windows, sparkling like the back of an evening gown in motion. It must have been that the Four Seasons was designed by Philip Johnson and is one of the most stunning landmarked interiors in New York—one of the few that will make you comfortable while you visit—and bring you a cloud of cotton candy studded with candied violets on your birthday.
Half the pleasure comes from being in that coldly beautiful, resolutely elitist dining room full of suits, knowing that John F. Kennedy celebrated his 45th birthday there  in 1962, with crab meat baked in a sea shell. That Norman Mailer threw his own 
 at the Four Seasons (and charged $50 a head). Graydon Carter, Aretha Franklin, Anna Wintour, and 
 were among the restaurant’s 
. Diana, Princess of Wales, came for lunch in the late '90s, just after Alex von Bidder and Julian Niccolini took the ownership.
Brasserie, which is also in the Seagram Building, is also closing. There was a time when Brasserie never closed. Back when it was 24 hours, the French restaurant was included in 
, a moldy little guide to getting laid in Manhattan, printed in 1966. The book nicknamed it "the bargain basement of the Four Seasons," which proved to be an unfortunately sticky label, and the author noted it was "worth attending occasionally, to observe what slithers down those stairs at dawn."
There was zero slithering last week. The soup was just all right, the whole fish wasn’t whole, and the seafood platter was business as usual. By 9:55 p.m., the restaurant was already winding down, getting ready for the morning rush of power breakfasts. A row of tiny screens above the bar, installed during the 2000 renovations by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, used to show images of diners walking through the entrance of the restaurant, so you always felt like you were in a moody drama about extra-marital affairs. Tonight it showed basketball.
Seymour Britchky reviewed the pleasures of what he called Brasserie’s suicide shift in 1978—raw clams and rare steaks at three a.m. in the company of insomniacs, post office workers, poker game losers, women still in the gowns they’d worn to the charity balls. It sounded good. But in New York, there’s always someone telling you how much better it was before. By 1978, according to Britchky, the food at Brasserie was already in decline. It had been better before.
Gael Greene, writing about the Four Seasons for 
 said in 1980: “I love the Four Seasons although I have never had a great meal there.” Maybe the greatness of the Seagram Building’s restaurants was never in the food. Maybe it transcended the food a long time ago.
I review restaurants for a living, but I know that sometimes, what you eat is beside the point. Sometimes you step into a restaurant as you would enter a grand cathedral; there's no intention of praying, but you want to be in the way of an absurd amount of beauty—to feel something.
This is easy at the Four Seasons, if you sip freezing cold gin under the tines of the Richard Lippold sculpture. Chances are, you’ll be taken care of by someone graceful and efficient who knows how to wait a table, and you’ll see how the regulars are greeted.
It’s hard to deny that these restaurants run on nostalgia, too. The partners behind Major Food Group, who will take over the Four Seasons and Brasserie spaces next summer, are good at nostalgia. They specialize in it. They have built an empire with the dark arts of nostalgia—waiters in tuxes and tableside service and extinct dishes revived with emphatic kitsch. They are sure to greatly improve the food and increase the prices and present something glamorous and massively theatrical, just the way New York’s hottest restaurant did in the summer of '59.
But I know now what I’ll say if the glass and walnut panels ever come down, the comfortable chairs are replaced, and the weird squishy padding under the tablecloths is pulled out. When the men don’t have to wear jackets and come for dinner in Shkreli hoodies. When the service trolleys are upgraded and new wine cellars built-in. When the room Johnson designed disappears and the Four Seasons is replaced. And a bit of New York is really and truly lost. I'll say it was better before.

=== Title: These Will Be the Best Blinged-Out Watches of 2016 - Bloomberg ===

And now for the real fun.
Baselworld, the annual watch and jewelry trade fair in Switzerland, is coming to a close. You’ve already seen the watches that will 
, as well as the 
 the industry will be talking about in 2016. But what about the bling? After all, your wrist is one of only so many places you can wear a piece of jewelry. Just because you want to be able to tell time, why should you have to sacrifice that prime real estate to something that lacks sparkle?
Here are six gorgeous watches that combine precious gems, stunning enamel work, and general aesthetic value. (Spoiler: Most of them are also stupendously expensive.)
 
This year Seiko added the first-ever tourbillon to its high-end Credor collection. To honor the gravitational power of the tiny device, the brand designed the face of the watch to mimic the famous Mt. Fuji wave paintings by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai. It is hand-lacquered and carved by top Japanese craftsmen, and the platinum case features 43 sapphires. It has a 37-hour power reserve, is limited to eight pieces, and will retail for $460,000.
 
You will not be able to be ignored wearing this watch. The 50 marquis-cut diamonds are set at different heights on the dial, as are the 60 marquis-cut rubies, which give the watch face a sense of real swirling movement. That’s not even to mention the absurd 71 baguette-cut diamonds that serve as a backdrop between 7 o'clock and 12 o’clock, or the 110 rubies and 178 diamonds on the bracelet—or, oh yeah, the 161 baguette-cut diamonds circling around the case. That's 630 stones, so far, but who's counting? Anyway, the Caliber HW2008 movement is fully automatic, if you care. Price upon request.
 
To celebrate the 40th anniversary of its Happy Diamonds collection, Chopard has debuted a new dial with its famous free-floating diamonds. (Happy diamonds are given room to breathe, you see.) The movement of the diamonds over the mother-of-pearl face just means that the watch will sparkle even more as you move through the room. The cushion-shaped 18K white gold case is inspired by the original 1976 Happy Diamonds men's watch, although here it's used in a watch for women for the first time with the line. There are more floating diamonds than ever, in different sizes, which really emphasizes the movement and sparkle of the piece. (It tells time, too, but with all that bling, who cares?). The square face retails for $54,570, while the round face goes for $49,500.
 
This year, the jewelry house de Grisogono added four bejeweled versions to their stately Retro watch line. The 44mm rectangular watches have an Art Deco feel to them, with a sapphire crystal that is subtly curved at the edges. When launched in 2015, they were relatively understated, with simple black and cream faces. But since this was de Grisogono, we knew that wasn't going to last. Later in the year, we saw models with gemstones on the dial. Now you can get the New Lady Retro with a diamond-, sapphire-, ruby-, or emerald-encrusted case.
 
The big brand theme for Hermès this year is “Nature at Full Gallop.” Accordingly, the fashion house showed several really wonderful wristwatches and pocket watches decorated with wildlife imagery. This particular pocket watch belongs to a trio (each one-of-a-kind) that were inspired by artist Annie Faivre's Hermès scarf designs. The enamelwork was painstaking: Via the Grand Feu technique, the enamel was painted on with tiny brushes and then fired more than 20 times in a kiln to make it melt perfectly onto the white gold base. On this particular watch, the layering of the enamel leaves over horse and rider is particularly striking. Since only one of these watches was made, it has already been sold. If you want it, best check EBay.
 
The Ondine line is new for Dior this year, but it’s a continuation of the beautiful automatic watches it has been turning out for quite some time. The rotor is on the front of the watch, and the designers at the fashion house have taken advantage of this to add beauty to the time-telling. (You’ve seen this trick in Dior's now-iconic feather watches, but it hasn’t gotten old.) Here, you can see a version studded with primarily green sapphires in what Dior calls a “snow” setting; the tiny gemstones are set completely flat into the dial, so they seem to blanket the surface like snow. The gold is exposed on part of the rotor, where it undulates like a wave. Twelve Ondines were made, using different colors of stones; depending on the gems and precious metals, they range from €120,000 to €160,000 ($134,000 to $179,000).

=== Title: The One Brand You Need to Know About From Milan Fashion Week - Bloomberg ===

Casual formality.
Remember those two words. It’s not a trend, really, but more like a current attitude among the top menswear designers and the international suiting community. Here's a definition: the practice of dressing down to dress up, or combining tailored items of clothing with more casual items. A "casually formal" suit would be one that fits quite well but is soft in the shoulder and made from a comfortable fabric. A casually formal 
 might involve a blazer paired with slim cargo pants or a more loose-fitting, neutral-colored trouser. A sweater might also be involved.
It's a modern style that comes across as effortless, and for me the brand that's doing it best is the Italian tailoring house 
. Founded in the early 1900s in Gambara, Italy, by the Boglioli family, the brand makes all its clothes by hand and specializes in garment-dyed items—meaning, the fabric is dyed after the jacket or pant is made, which ends up looking surprisingly different from when you make the same thing from a ream of fabric that comes predyed.
In the mid-1990s, the company, under the direction of Pierluigi Boglioli, took a sharp turn and abandoned the slim, structured Italian tailoring it had been churning out for nearly a century. Instead, the Boglioli brothers started making deconstructed blazers—ones without the canvas underpinnings that make many standard suits hold their shape. The result was, you guessed it, casual formality. Suits hugged the shoulder more naturally and moved less stiffly on the wearer.
I first became aware of the brand when I encountered one of its signature garment-dyed sport jackets on a photo shoot about five years ago. At the time the coats were a highly praised but hard-to-find-in-the-U.S. cult favorite of fashion insiders—despite their longevity. The jacket was unstructured cotton and dyed in the most vibrant cobalt blue, complete with a perfectly symmetrical and rounded patch pocket. I remember it still today because it was 
 much better than anything else I had seen in a while (and I have seen my fair share of blue blazers).
The same can be said about the first time I walked in to one of the company's presentations during 
. It's no coincidence that that was four seasons ago, the same time that 
 took over as design director. Under his practiced eye, the already stellar brand flourished into an excellent ready-to-wear collection.
The clothing that walks the runways this month will be in stores next spring, and for this line, Vosoghi stuck to his  laid-back silhouettes. He even gave them a new, vaguely ’70s-inspired shape. (He also appears to be channeling a certain Brazilian playboy nonchalance.) Some of my favorite looks include retro Baylon-style polos (ones that have a knit waistband) that were worn under suits, and outfits that featured similar tones worn together. Somehow that style of combining colors always makes complicated patterns—or varying tones of red—look smart and elevated.

=== Title: Emma Reynolds Takes East End Japanese Food to Prime Central London - Bloomberg ===

Emma Reynolds, one of the U.K.'s leading women restaurateurs, plans to open a Japanese brasserie in St James's, expanding from the group of sushi and ramen bars she built from her base in London's East End.
It's part of the new £400 million  ($574 million) 
development, a 50-50 joint venture in between 
, which manages a property portfolio on behalf of the monarchy and the Treasury, and 
, a Canadian real-estate firm.
The office development will house seven restaurants, including 
 the London outpost of the Nordic restaurant in New York; and a new 
group outlet.
Reynolds's 2,140 square-foot establishment at 1 Norris Street, which she is creating with her business partner Kensuke Yamada, will be called 
, Japanese for apricot. It will feature contemporary dishes such as king crab gyoza, wagyu beef with soy butter and miso-cured salmon, along with 
set lunches. 
It's a step up from the 
 sushi restaurants Reynolds founded with Yamada, in 2007. 
 ramen bars followed in 2012 and include two outlets in rundown areas of East London, one of them in a railway arch.
Reynolds and Yamada have eight restaurants , employ 120 people and last year posted revenue of more than £5 million.
"Rents in London are crazy and premiums are huge just to get hold of sites," Reynolds says. "We've taken big risks to avoid premiums. We want to keep the businesses growing organically and not lose our equity share to someone else and lose control of it."
Reynolds is one of a small group of women restaurateurs and chefs, including Thomasina Miers, who founded the 
 group of Mexican restaurants; Angela Hartnett of 
; Nieves Barragan-Mohacho of 
;  Sally Clarke (

But Reynolds is part of a new generation of women restaurateurs in East London, who have formed themselves into a collective called Lily + Skinner, seeking to support each other with everything from recruiting and staffing through to purchasing and marketing.
"It happened because I was calling around a couple of friends in Hackney who have restaurants to see if we could help each other out," Reynolds says. "We all sit at the top of our businesses, so we don't face discrimination first-hand within our organizations. But we are all mindful of seeking to recruit and look after women, especially in the kitchen. Historically, it's the kitchens that have been male-led and testosterone-driven, but things are changing."

Sat Bains, a British chef whose menu starts at 85 pounds ($133), will create a burger for 
 that will be served in London's Covent Garden for a single day, on Friday, Oct. 9.
Expect bold flavors: Bains is a big personality, known for his outspoken humor and robust style. Diners critique his food at their own risk. When one woman criticized one of his dishes, he reciprocated by sharing his opinion of her clothing.
Bains, who holds two Michelin stars at 
, will serve only 500 of the Major Oak, which he developed with the New York's chain's culinary director, Mark Rosati. It will cost 7.25 pounds ($11.33).
Made with Shake Shack’s Aberdeen Angus beef patty, the burger is topped with fresh shallots and a slice of Beauvale cheese from 
 in Nottingham, where Bains is based. Bains also created a forest-inspired ketchup made of seasonal "Penny Bun" mushrooms flavored with pine salt from the needles of local trees, as well as a smoked mayo with a hint of charcoal from the red oaks from Sherwood Forest.
Last year, Shake Shack collaborated with the three-star Italian chef 
, of

=== Title: Every Expensive Thing in Fifty Shades of Grey, Explained - Bloomberg ===

As much has been made about the kinky sex in 
, BDSM isn't the only major fetish of the bestselling book series. The other sin is that universal turn-on: money, money, money. 
Anastasia Steele’s tortured romance with billionaire Christian Grey is about love, and it’s about all that bondage sex, of course. But we all know that bling can be an aphrodisiac, too. (Christian’s worth, 
, is estimated to be $2.2 billion.)
The luxury porn starts with Christian’s sleek glass office and continues as little Ana from Savannah hops into a helicopter for their first date. From there, she encounters endless fine suits, high-end watches, museum-quality art, expensive sound equipment, fancy hotels, that fleet of Audis, and of course, high-end bondage gear. 
It’s a lot to keep track of, but we've identified every single luxury item we could nail down from director Sam Taylor-Johnson’s film version of the bestselling book series. 
Christian is an 
 man, flashing two models prominently throughout the film, the white-faced 
 ($7,200) and black-faced 
 ($26,500). Omega (as opposed to a more rarified niche brand such as Richard Mille) may seem like an odd choice for a billionaire, but I’m chalking that one up to author E.L. James not being a watch connoisseur. (
). For example, that platinum one Christian gave Ana in the book sequels doesn’t actually exist, according to our expert Stephen Pulvirent. Sorry, ladies.
Those 
 ($991) in the contract negotiation scene definitely do exist and are just one of the sly details Christian uses to signal his lifestyle (and Academy Award-winning costume designer Mark Bridges picked to amuse the cast). He takes a more straightforward approach with his luxury leather goods—belts, briefcases, travel bags, wallet—all by 
 (from $375 to $5,975, and then some). Those just say, “I’m classy.”
The body is by “jogging,” the underwear is by “commando,” and the condoms are by Trojan (a telltale glint of gold means 
, naturally; box of 26 $19.99). Oh, and Christian’s sex jeans are by a random Canadian “that Erika was very specific on the look of,” according to Bridges—though they looked suspiciously like 
 to me, ripped and faded and roomy, riding low in all the right ways.
Christian is all about 
, with a fleet comprising 
, 
, and 
 (from $75,500 to $114,900 and up) and a 
 (from $48,300), plus tight-lipped 
 (their silence, $priceless). But only he gets to drive the 
 (from $167,000). He even buys Ana a red 
 ($29,990) for her college graduation, selling her 
 in the process—without asking, of course. (At least he kept it German.)
One word: 
. When it comes to business attire, no billionaire is going off-the-rack, least of all Christian Grey. (See: control issues.) There were so many well-cut suits popping up onscreen I thought of negotiating my own Dom/sub contract—with a tailor.
Designer Mark Bridges kept the wool lightweight and Italian, the cuts classic, and the buttons were mainly limited to one. Although actor Jamie Dornan is slender, Bridges didn’t shy away from peaked lapels. He told me Cary Grant and modern international style icons such as David Beckham and David Gandy served as inspiration to get that perfect “clean, classic, young, expensive, and sexy” look. Good quality, classic design is always in style. 
 sewed the 
 (from $300) and 
 (from $185), including eight of 
. Shoes are the only thing Bridges hit Rodeo Drive to buy, as production timing didn’t allow custom work by cobblers; one pair is 
(upwards of $1,500). 
 
Boxers or briefs? Christian doesn’t play that game and instead goes for 
, a cult Swiss brand at around $100 a pair. When he’s not in a suit, he’s in a well-fit pair of 
 ($495) and 
 ($850), thin cashmere sweaters by 
 ($289), and a 
 
 (from $4,195).  On his gliding date, that jacket gets switched up for a 
 ($980) and a 
 ($198). 
Christian isn’t even afraid to get his 
 ($135) and 
($195) all dirty when working out in classic 
 kicks. See, he’s a real guy. Just an incredibly expensive version of one, “the hot sort of human,” as Ana's roommate puts it.
Seattle aviation law allows only certain types of helicopters to be used, so while Christian’s 
 couldn’t be exactly like the book, his 
 buttery chestnut brown seats and black 
are still plenty pimp. (It costs around $3.2 million.) When he surprises Anastasia down in Savannah for a post-breakfast glider ride, that’s a 
. Like his choice of auto, this two-seater hawk-like stunner is also German, handmade in Bruchsal to the tune of $150,000.
Lest Anastasia feel left out, he gives her some goodies, too, like his definitely-not-Vista-Print business card (we’re thinking more 
; from $269) and a 
 
 (somewhere in the neighborhood of $14,000). One night he whisks her to his room at the 
(from $329 a night) after “rescuing her” from her friends—which would have been relatively romantic had she not been blacked out.
If you’re going to drink a lot of 
 and
, you’re going to want 
(from $135 each) to drink it out of—although by the shape of some of the stemware, we think we spied a 
 or two in a scene as well. For bubbles, it’s all about the 
. Christian keeps cocktails classic: a gin and tonic, either with 
 and a cucumber or 
 and lime.
“International Contemporary, à la Tom Ford, Lenny Kravitz, and Ron Arad” is how production designer David Wasco and set designer Sandy Wasco described Christian’s personal design sensibility. Translation: rich.
 Christian Grey’s penthouse may have been a set, but his home base, 
, is a real building in Seattle where a 
 in 2013, according to Zillow. Its windows do actually lord above the skyline.
The Wascos had free range to ratchet up the glamor on the somewhat “Vegas-y” Escala. The key was to make it timeless, like a photograph by Helmut Newton. Imagine a-list architects
 and 
, or just 
 here. Dark woods hint at the Pacific Northwest. That
 is approximately $12,000 a room. There’s marble everywhere—moody course-grained slabs for the floors and a lighter grey (of course) in a bathroom. That’s a 
 (from $7,150) they get busy in, by the way. Those appliances in the kitchen are a 
(from $1,805) and 
(from $7,030), like any self-respecting urbanite. Fresh flowers—
—are delivered every three days. 
Like his suits, the living room sofa is custom Italian. Other design-room pieces shout, “I’m moneyed” in a masculine, worldly accent.
The Wascos asked the question, “What would a cultured twentysomething tech billionaire control freak in Seattle actually buy?” The answer is a 
 and Avenue Folding Screen by Portuguese designers 
; and midcentury and Deco styled lighting by 
 (t
, t
, and t
); plus everything from dramatic mirrors, to bedroom chairs, to avant-garde gilt scones and chandeliers from 
. All prices on request. (Though if you have to ask ….)
Nodding toward the Pacific Northwest location, 
created a redwood and brass side table (price on request) to complement a 
 
 surrounded by vintage 
(from $1,198 for reproductions). You can find a similar table on 
 for $17,355.
And what about that piano? It’s a 
, handmade in Italy over three years using red spruce (from the same forests Stradivarius used), with some parts plated in 18K gold. It cost $268,999. No wonder Christian’s song selections are so serious. 
Christian follows the first tenet of art collecting: Buy what moves you.
And what moves him? Womanly figures and wisps of S&M, like the subtly entrapping floral vines of 
’s 
  or the clasped hands in black gloves of his 
.  Make what you will of

Artwork at his office is where the marquee names really light up.
There’s

 also grace his office walls. Sensual sculptures include

Who knows how much art, worth millions more, is waiting to rotate in from his collection?
Christian’s stark white marble office is designed to make an impression: floor-to-ceiling windows, 
 topped by 
 brass lamp, a potted tree that twists like rope. The lobby is an actual building by 
 in Vancouver.
Even the mundane is on point, like plentiful 
 (
 in gold foil; lucky for unprepared “journalists”) and a 
 ($686) for conducting real business.
A 
($1,749 all tricked out) is his computer of choice (handy with all that iMessaging), so it’s no surprise Christian keeps it in the ecosystem with a black 
(up to $549). Yep, even billionaires don’t always update. Ironic if it’s because 
 under contract … to his phone company. 
A cheesy sex dungeon this is not. Christian Grey’s playroom is as serious and sensual as he is, with deep red walls, crimson 
, and 
 with a custom 
. (There are no sheets here, but 
 were used in the rest of the apartment.)
Director Taylor-Johnson asked for an equestrian feel, meaning brown leather instead of black, with brass hardware like a 
. Everything is lined up in its place—silk eye masks, leather floggers, metal shackles, ticklers made from horsehair and peacock feathers—like a tack room in a BDSM barn. The room smells of lemon oil polish.
“This was the hardest thing to develop and carry out, to fit into the world of the penthouse” without making it garish or weird, explained the Wascos. Which means if you want your own high-class playroom, get ready to go bespoke. “It’s virtually handmade.”
There are
, secured by shoe tacks. A honeycomb-like custom
 articulates down from the ceiling via the touch of an 
. (Christian shackles Ana to it.) None of this came cheap. Nor did the 
—Tally Ho Chair ($14,600), Detention Chest ($20,000), Study Chair ($10,800)—by British designer 
. Functional for BDSM but at the same time inviting, they're centerpieces that the Wascos built the room around. Brazier-Jones ships around the world from the U.K. with finishes customized to client's preferences (chocolate brown leather here, green velvet there, bronze instead of aluminum) for additional cost.
Like love, you can’t put a price on this setup.

Ciao! It’s me. And it’s also 
, the biannual 
 that sees the most outlandish peacocks descend on Florence, Italy, twice a year—even if we're in
. It’s one of the few fashion events at which the best clothes are often found on the cobblestone streets instead of in the halls themselves. Buyers, marketing VPs, press, and countless loudly dressed men gather in the Renaissance capital hoping to get their photo snapped and (gasp!) maybe even have it featured somewhere like this. We’re happy to oblige.
If you flip through
, you’ll see colorful suede string loafers, all manner of striped shorts, and more pastel linen jackets than you can comprehend. But, in case you didn’t notice, it’s a little chilly outside for tunic tops. So what’s a dandy to do?
The answer is simple: Wear a show-stopping topcoat.
If you have to cover up, there are two rules. Your outermost layer has to be simple but obviously impressive, and what’s underneath has to be interesting enough that passersby take a second look. Whether that means a three-piece chalk-stripe suit neatly tucked under a single-breasted camel topcoat, or an oversize coat with a fur collar doing all the talking over a slim black turtleneck,

=== Title: Eight Hearty Barrel-Aged Beers to Keep You Warm This Winter - Bloomberg ===

According to the 
, this winter’s looking like a déjà vu of last year’s for those who experienced epic snowfall and record lows. Here to help, we have a selection of robust barrel-aged beers with generous alcohol by volume to help warm you on colder nights (hopefully by a roaring fire). These eight choices exemplify the more decadent side of brewing.
’s (Kalamazoo, Mich.) 
 was formerly un-recommendable, because of its impossibly limited production (and a resulting “white whale” status in the beer-nerd world). Luckily, for the past few years production has scaled up somewhat, and this special bourbon barrel-aged blend of their Expedition Stout and Double Cream Stout is now more accessibly packaged in 12-ounce four-packs.
Roasty chocolate and coffee notes are underpinned by a fluffy mouthfeel.
’ (Amherst, Wis.) 
 is one of the more reliably stellar examples of the style. Plus, it’s a gem that flies under the radar of obsessives, which means it manages to remain on shelves long after its annual release. You’ll taste caramel and vanilla, and experience a drying, oak-laden finish.
’s (Paso Robles, Calif.) 
—the beer formerly known as Abacus—is at this point an institution in the realm of bourbon barrel-aged barleywines. While it’s not particularly easy to find when released, if you manage to score a bomber it’s an ideal candidate to split with someone close. Sweet candied fruits and molasses heartily merge in this bourbon-heavy delight.
’s (Grand Rapids, Mich.) 
 is what happens when the brand dumps its 
 Scotch ale into bourbon barrels for a yearlong slumber. Happily for us, the extremely delicious result goes relatively unnoticed compared with Founders’ barrel-aged stouts, which tend to steal the spotlight. Dark fruit and earth mingle with a sweet, malty backdrop here.
’s (Seattle) 
 is something of an enigma in the landscape of barrel-aged beer. The brewery’s winter-warmer 
 (which is a forgettable genre) is aged in carefully selected bourbon barrels, which turns the beverage into a transcendent beast of its own, defying any categorization. Fudge, leather, and spice dominate, and the whole thing is sharpened by a warming alcoholic edge.
’s (Chicago) 
 is a true cult favorite, and since the brand was taken over by Anheuser-Busch InBev, it’s become easier and easier to find annually. While novel variants are released each year with different adjuncts and/or barrel treatments, the standard release itself is always a treat. Smoke, tobacco, and wood dance on a ≈15 percent ABV platform.
’ (Brooklyn, N.Y.) 
 is a terrifically well-executed stout from a gypsy brewing duo best known for hoppy and sour recipes. While the base beer alone is a very competent offering, the barrel-aging brings it into a different category of flavor. Woody char and espresso notes are expressed with a slick, oily mouthfeel.
’s (Oxford, Conn.)
 is the erudite brewery’s latest effort to reinterpret an extinct German porter (brewed with oats, molasses, wheat, and licorice root). These guys love their barrels, and this time the team has used a mix of barrels that formerly housed zinfandel, whiskey, pinot noir, and Pedro Ximénez sherry to age the base Phantasma porter. Then they double-matured the liquid in a former Burgundy barrel. Richly tannic with a velvety sourness, it’s a bold oddity. [

=== Title: Duck & Rice Is a Fantasy Chinese Restaurant in London’s Chinatown - Bloomberg ===

Just when we’re all getting used to the idea that China has a range of distinct cuisines—eight is the magic number, as with so many things in the country—along comes a restaurant that adds a ninth cuisine: Disney Chinese. The new 
 is like a Western fantasy of China, but it works.
The long menu hops in and out of bed with a bunch of culinary partners: Cantonese dim sum to Sichuan chili chicken; Fujian fried rice to Malaysian curry. It even embraces chop suey and wasabi prawn. It really is very naughty.
This new restaurant in Soho—home to London’s Chinatown—is the brainchild of Alan Yau, who created 
 and 
.
The Hong Kong-born restaurateur believes that one key to success is to divorce food from its origins, just as 
 than it is Italian. Here, he’s taking Chinese food out of China and making it accessible to anyone who’s tasted sweet-and-sour pork. The fortune cookies are missing, but I’m still feeling lucky.
Duck & Rice looks beautiful, though I don’t quite get the concept of the ground-floor bar, which is dominated by beer tanks. Yau says it’s an homage to the British pub. That’s a bit confusing, especially as the tanks contain unpasteurized Pilsner Urquell, which is delivered from the Czech Republic every day. Should you say cheers, 
, or 
 After a couple of pints, you really won’t care. Even sober, I didn’t spot any signs pointing to the restaurant at the top of a spiral staircase.
The nearest thing to a greeter at night was a bouncer: possibly necessary for Soho but not the most welcoming of sights. You don’t know whether to say hello or open your bags to show you are not carrying any drugs—a measure that might thin out the population of a few restaurants and clubs in the neighborhood.
When you do find your way upstairs, the dining room is noisy. The menu is a welcome distraction. It’s as comprehensive as at my local takeaway, where many options end up tasting much the same. Here, each dish is individual, from the distinctively spiced chicken chop suey at £12.50 ($19.46) to the hot, hot, hot Sichuan chili chicken (£16.50) to the soothing Malaysian chicken curry (£14.50).
A starter snack features slivers of chili with warm cashew nuts and crispy shallots. It’s colorful and irresistible.
The superb sweet-and-sour pork (£9) is more sour than sweet and comes loaded with large chunks of pineapple. The crispy shredded beef (£9) has a citrus kick, though its sweetness made it one of my least favorite dishes. Indeed, a couple of other selections, including the big and juicy wasabi prawns, might benefit from being a bit less toothsome.
There’s fine dim sum, particularly the har gau, the cheung fun, and the venison puff. And the Cantonese roast duck (reared on a natural diet at family-owned Silver Hill Farm) features soft and savory flesh and intensely flavored skin.
The desserts are happily off the wall. I particularly liked the pickled cucumber, ginger, and Sichuan pepper soup with ginger ice cream. Mango, lime soup, and mint ice cream is a safer bet.
Yau is such a creative restaurateur he dares to fail. (One of his recent ventures, Naamyaa Café, was short-lived.) Duck & Rice is a winner. Bring on the sweet and sour.
Duck & Rice is at 90 Berwick St., Soho, W1F 0QB; +44-20-3327-7888 or

=== Title: Fat Duck Reopens This Month - With $390 Tasting Menu - Bloomberg ===

Booking started at midday for the Fat Duck, which reopens on Sept. 29, nine months after chef 
 moved his restaurant and staff for a temporary residency in Melbourne.
Prospective diners must pay 255 pounds ($390) per person in advance for 
, with extra charges for drinks and service on the day at the restaurant in Bray, west of London.
That's a lot to pay but there is unlikely to be any shortage of applicants: 
 is usually booked up months in advance. Diners are drawn by dishes such as the Sound of the Sea, where guests wear earphones to listen to a tape of gulls and crashing waves while consuming seafood scattered on edible sand.
Blumenthal is serving a new menu and promises a new style of service at the restaurant, which is known for the theatrical presentation of dishes, sometimes involving magic tricks.
The restaurant, housed in a former pub, has been refurbished during the Melbourne residency. There is a new kitchen, too, while the menu will take the form of a map and uses a nostalgic day in Blumenthal's childhood as a framework.
The Fat Duck is a former winner of the World's 50 Best Restaurants awards and Blumenthal has influenced a generation of chefs with his experimental style. It's often described as molecular gastronomy, a term he and fellow chefs 
 reject.

Le Chabanais was conceived by Varun Talreja, a film producer, together with Aizpitarte and his partners Franck Audoux and Laurent Cabut. A receptionist at the Mayfair restaurant today said it was temporarily closed because of a gas leak and that Talreja was traveling and not available for comment.
Aizpitarte is one of Europe's most-respected young chefs and is a leading figure in the "Bistronomie" movement of casual gastronomy. Le Chateaubriand is a destination for the food crowd.

=== Title: How to Help the Greek Economy by Drinking - Bloomberg ===

At the beach, I’m doing my bit to boost the Greek economy by sipping a refreshing Domaine Sigalas Assyrtiko, a salty, smoky white wine from the romantic, volcanic island of Santorini. Just so you know, this is not just altruism—Greek wines have been on an upward quality trajectory for years, and they’re better than ever despite the debt-ridden country’s financial woes.  
Luckily, now that the banks have reopened, wineries may be able to pay for the bottles, corks, and equipment they need for the 2015 harvest, which starts next month. Because of capital controls imposed in June, though, that will be complicated. Suppliers are demanding cash upfront. 
So boost sales and drink up. 
Not a Greek wine fan? You should be.
I first fell in love with Greek wines a decade ago when I served as a judge at a wine competition in Thessaloniki and spent a week tasting, touring, and trying to perfect my pronunciation of local grapes like agiorgitiko. (A tongue-twisting name has long been a clue that the wine will be a bargain.) 
Three hundred or so native varieties grow in Greece, but despite the country’s several thousand years of winemaking history, many had nearly died out by the end of the 19th century. Vineyard taxation and Muslim prohibition of alcohol during the four-century-long Ottoman occupation almost did them in. 
Then, in the early 1980s, along came committed grape rescuers like pioneer Evangelos Gerovassiliou, who started his eponymous winery in 1981 on a peninsula southeast of Thessaloniki. He revived the white grape malagousia after a professor found the last remaining vine in a remote mountain village (or so goes the tale). 
A quick Greek grape lesson: The four major varieties besides malagousia are two other whites—light, fragrant moschofilero and salty, minerally assyrtiko—and two reds: fruity, elegant agiorgitiko and spicy, earthy xinomavro. 
One of Greece’s best wineries, Alpha Estate, is a knockout producer of xinomavro. When I first visited this bright pink winery in the windy northwest region of Amyndeon, about 25 miles from the Albanian border, winemaker Angelos Iatridis described how he’d tracked down dozens of owners in order to buy 85 small plots of land. Piece by piece, he assembled one single large block of vineyards for the winery. It’s a model of the latest developments in what’s called “precision” viticulture. A sensor system in the vineyard continuously monitors the moisture content in each patch of soil. 
Alpha Estate was created from scratch in the late 1990s, and received 40 percent of its total investment in machinery and construction from the European Union, and older wineries have relied on EU subsidies to modernize. You could say the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) helped kick-start the wine revolution in Greece after the country joined in 1981. CAP implements subsidies for some kinds of vine research, vineyard replanting, construction projects, and even equipment purchases like tractors.
Alpha Estate benefits from being part of an EU-funded agrotourism network and also from CAP subsidies for 50 percent of the cost of wine promotion outside the EU, extremely helpful as one immediate effect of the financial crisis was shrinking local demand. People didn’t have enough money to go to restaurants, so more wine bars sprang up, serving wine by the glass. (But since imported wines were no longer affordable, Greeks did begin to try the country’s own indigenous varieties.) 
Wineries that began exporting a decade ago are in the best position, and many more have turned to export markets since 2009, when, fortunately, consumers in places like the U.S. became highly interested in unusual grapes that offered good value. According to Sofia Perpera, director of the Greek Wine Bureau-North America, U.S. imports of the wines are up 25 percent over the last five years. 
Now, Greece is in the throes of a second revolution, as talented young winemakers experiment with single-vineyard wines, special cuvees, even sparkling wines. The up-and-coming white grapes are vidiano from Crete, the latest regional hot spot, and robola from Cephalonia, in the Ionian islands; the hot reds are limnio, Greece’s oldest grape, and mavrodaphne, which used to make only sweet wines.  
Of the country’s diverse wine regions, the one now having its New York moment is spare, white-washed Santorini, one of the Cyclades Islands in the Aegean Sea. Its striking assyrtikos, the best whites in Greece in my opinion, have captured many of the city’s top sommeliers (like Michael Madrigale of Boulud Sud) with their lemony, mineral, summer-perfect freshness.
The Santorini vines, trained in basket-like coils to hide the grapes from the hot Mediterranean sun, grow in ash, gray-white pumice stone, and lava deposited by a massive volcanic eruption bigger than Krakatoa some 3,000 years ago. Since I first explored the island five years ago, three new wineries have opened. 
As part of EU promotion efforts, more than 50 Greek winemakers descended on New York a couple of months ago to show off their latest vintages. I liked more whites than reds. Here are my picks of those most worth trying. 
With the zesty scent of citrus and sun-ripened peaches, this white has a lively freshness that’s perfect for a summer aperitif. 
 Knife-like acidity and citrusy flavors with a salty tang give this refreshing Santorini white a taste of the sea. Owner Paris Sigalas, a mathematician trained in Paris, founded the winery in 1991.
Another brilliant version of this grape from Santorini, this is all lemon, minerals, and spice, with more complexity than the Sigalas.
From Cefalonia, in the Ionian Islands, this light-bodied dry white from a very rare grape variety is fresh, pure, and vibrant, with flowery aromas and a hint of minerality. 
This delicious, charming white is made on Crete from an ancient variety, vidiano, and is ideal for beach drinking. 
 
This silky-textured, intense red is from mavrodaphne grapes grown in a high-altitude vineyard on the slopes of Mt. Enos on Cephalonia. 
A velvety red from 90-year-old high-altitude vines in the Tortoise Nest subregion, this may be the country’s best xinomavro, deep, rich, and subtle. 
From the Naoussa region, this light-bodied red, with its bright cherry fruit, reminds me of a charming Beaujolais. Winemaker Apostolos Thymiopoulos is one of Greece’s rising stars. 
Fragrant agiorgitiko is an amazingly versatile grape, made in a variety of styles. This one, from Greece’s most important red wine appellation, Nemea, is distinctively spicy and cedary. 

=== Title: Boozy Root Beer Is About to Be Huge - Bloomberg ===

Pumpkins, peaches, and chocolate. Eventually, beermakers were going to get back to roots.
Hard root beer–think A&W with alcohol–is coming to a head this summer, as craft breweries look for a competitive edge and drinkers develop a taste for sweeter swill.
One brand, in particular, is coveted: Not Your Father’s Root Beer, from Small Town Brewery in Wauconda, Ill. The brew earned an enviable rating of 
 on Beer Advocate, an online review aggregator. In comparison, New Belgium’s Fat Tire, a darling of craft drinkers, scores only an 84.
"I would venture to say everyone I know who drinks alcohol has had [hard root beer] by this point," says Matt Simpson, an Atlanta-based consultant who does business as the Beer Sommelier. "As far as the popularity goes, it’s pretty simple: It tastes pretty good. It tastes like root beer, only with alcohol that you can’t really taste anyway."
Small Town brewed its first batch of root beer in 2013, sprinkling a vat with sassafras bark, vanilla, anise, wintergreen, and handfuls of additional spices. As popularity grew, it worked out a distribution agreement with Pabst Brewing earlier this year. A few months later the Not Your Father's brand was purchased outright by a group of investors that included Pabst Chief Executive Officer Eugene Kashper.
Despite the flood of resources and a nationwide push, online 
 are filling up with reports of long lines and tips on where to track down Not Your Father's.
"We really made this for ourselves and local consumers more than anything," Small Town founder Tim Kovac said via e-mail. "[I] had no idea it would take off this way. ... It really seems to hit on a sense of nostalgia for people."
Indeed, root beer is hitting taps at an auspicious time, as cocktails trend sweeter. If Don Draper’s Old Fashioned was the toast of 2010, 
 is the rock and rye, a 19th century concoction mixing rye whiskey with citrus, rock candy, or honey. It’s sweet, herby, and strong, with an old timey flavor not far from that of root beer.
Simpson, the Beer Sommelier, says a lot of his friends are mixing bourbon with the new hard root beer. "The flavor profiles are very complementary," he says. "It's almost like an alco-pop."
For an increasingly crowded field of craft brewers, alcoholic root beer represents a bit of a strategic coup. As a product, it’s virtual white space; yet every potential customer is already familiar with the taste. It requires far less of a nudge than 90 percent of the stuff the country’s almost 3,000 craft brewers are tossing in their vats these days. (See: 
 and 
). What's more, root beer’s sweeter profile appeals to people who aren’t keen on beer that tastes like, well, beer.
Pabst and Kovac, meanwhile, are hoping to capitalize on its success. They are brewing up two additional root beers that are 11 percent and 20 percent alcohol, respectively. On taps in Chicago, Small Town is selling something called Grandma's Apple Pie Beer.
And if you can’t find Not Your Father’s, relax; your local craft operation is probably fine-tuning a root beer recipe right now. Chicago's Berghoff Brewery 
 a new brew called Rowdy Root Beer in June. Meanwhile, Boston Beer, the maker of Sam Adams, is 
 working on its own version, although the company did not return requests for comment.

=== Title: London Restaurants: Where to Eat in Hackney - Bloomberg ===

Hackney is becoming so hip, it's tempting to expect the restaurants to be style over substance, aimed at an Instagram generation whose highs and lows may not always be gastronomic.
That's just not true. The cooking and service at many spots rival those in the West End, which tend to be more expensive and formal. It's worth the trip to East London, one of the city's newer dining destinations.
Here are 11 great places to try.
This grill house in a railway arch in Haggerston serves dishes from across the Middle East and North Africa, including home-smoked meats finished on an open grill. There's a bar along one side of the room, offering craft beers as well as unusual cocktails. For somewhere so cool and moody, the service is friendly and efficient. Dish to try: The Full Israeli brunch at £25 ($35) for two.
This colorful café in Haggerston is an unlikely place to find some of London's finest chicken. The birds are free-range herb-fed while the vegetables are from the Keveral Farm organic farming community. The chicken comes hot, sweet and sour in crunchy coatings, while the original cocktail list offers a range of sours. Dish to try: Guest Fry - drumstick & thigh, kung pao glaze, chilli, peanut, spring onion (£11).
This Stoke Newington neighborhood restaurant traces its tangled culinary roots to Tel Aviv, California and Montreal. It started life in food markets before making it indoors a few months ago. The Good Egg is particularly strong on brunch. Dish to try: Shakshuka - baked eggs in a spiced tomato and pepper sauce, with preserved lemon yoghurt & sumac and a challah roll (£10),
This casual Italian restaurant in a high-ceilinged room is one of my favorites in Hackney. The open kitchen is dominated by a pizza oven turning out creations such as radicchio, gorgonzola, walnuts (£12.50). The cured meats are also big on flavor, particularly the fennel pollen salami (£5.50). Dish to try: Nduja, rocket pesto, fior di latti pizza (£13.20) with layers of flavor from nutty through spicy to very hot.
The novelty of this burger restaurant, almost hidden behind the stalls of a street market, is the excellent wine list. But Lucky Chip can be judged on its burgers alone, and they are among the finest in London. Dish to try: The Royale Wit Cheese (£8.95) is world class if you pay an extra £3 to upgrade to 40-day dry-aged Galician beef, with its deep, smoky flavor.
You might go a long way to taste better kebabs cooked over a charcoal grill and served with salad and warm bread than at this restaurant, which was established in 1990. A simple kebab shows the quality of the juicy lamb. Throw in a starter of lahmacun Turkish pizza (£2) and you are done. Dish to try: Sish kebab (£10.50).
Primeur is favorite among the restaurants I visited in Hackney. It's an understated neighborhood hangout in a former garage, where you may find yourself sharing a table as you check the blackboard and choose from European dishes such as lamb leg and creamed spinach (£15.50). It's not especially cheap but the prices reflect the quality of the ingredients. Dish to try: Spelt, wild garlic and Parmesan (£9).
This London Fields sibling of Ducksoup in Soho serves an eclectic menu of mainly light dishes that are strong on flavor.  Rawduck has a high-ceiling, large windows, shared tables and a pared-down design that is typical of Hackney. Dishes that stand out include poached chicken broth, minestra nera, butter beans and polenta (£12). Dish to try: Mussels, pancetta, rosemary and charred sourdough (£10).
This Jamaican restaurant serves fine jerk chicken that has been marinated for 24 hours and cooked over charcoal and wood smoke. It's served with a choice of sauces - papaya, banana pepper, and jerk ketchup - and costs £13.50 for a half or £24 for a whole. Also look out for the special of goat curry. The service is friendly and the cocktails are hot, including the signature Katch a Fire rum punch at £12, or £28 sharing. Dish to try: Jerk Chicken.
50 Stoke Newington Rd., N16 7XB; +44-20-7249-9930
Tonkotsu is known for its fine ramen and seafood, including classic noodles with king prawn, squid, clams, seasoned egg, bamboo shoots and spring onions (£11). The Mare Street outlet has one of London's widest selections of Japanese whiskies, including the 
 £45 for 25ml - or £89 for 50ml. Dish to try: Chicken kara-age burger (£6.95).
Chef Matthew Young and sommelier Jack Lewens opened this 48-seat London Fields bistro in November. The seasonal menu changes daily and features uncluttered dishes that highlight just a few ingredients. The five-course tasting menu costs £38, while the adventurous wine list is also reasonably priced for London, with bottles starting at £20. Dish to try: Raw mullet, rhubarb and radicchio (£7).
 
 
 
 
 

=== Title: Rock Star Restaurateur Gives Natural Wine the Spotlight - Bloomberg ===

Does anyone remember Hulk Hogan’s short-lived pasta restaurant in Bloomington, Minn.? Or Britney Spears’s Nyla in Manhattan? Celebrity involvement in restaurants can be a kiss of death—sometimes the bigger the celebrity, the faster and fatter that kiss. This may have something to do with the alchemy of hype and money and taste, and the fact that celebrities simply don’t tend to have much experience in the already precarious business of hospitality.
But here’s how you can tell that 
 is actually good: Regardless of how much you know about its famous investors, it’s a wonderful place to spend the evening. The new wine bar in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg is the first restaurant from James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem and Christina 
. They opened the place together with partner Randy Moon, wine consultant Justin Chearno, a former guitarist who was also once the buyer at a local wine shop, and general manager Katrina Birchmeier, a wine expert who built her reputation at Garagistes in Tasmania.
The room seats only about 40, and though it’s spare it manages to feel cozy, decorated simply with pale slatted wood and walls of textured burlap that have been washed over with white paint. In this little room, the staff of wine nerds seems to relish zooming around, popping open esoteric bottles from all over the world, and pouring them for you with very little explanation and lots of enthusiasm.
Sometimes, when the place is packed and service slows down, you’ll wish they zoomed a little faster. But the servers are down to earth, generally cool without being cold. There’s something charming about how, when you do have their attention, you can always tell their favorite bottles from the way they’ll nod and grin as you order. “Yeah, I don’t even like to say too much about that one,” my server told me after I’d gushed over the rosé I tasted. “I really don’t want to spoil it for people by talking about it too much.”
The wine menu, about 12 by the glass plus a list of about 250 bottles, is different (at least a little) almost every day. There was just one rosé by the glass recently—a weird, wonderful grenache from the 27-year-old French winemaker Olivier Cohen.
Natural wines resist a textbook definition. The term is used to describe a growing class of sometimes erratic, anti-establishment wines made, generally, in small amounts and manipulated as little as possible by the winemakers. The international demand for these wines is 
, and the people who produce them—like Frank Cornelissen, who does his thing way up on Mount Etna in Sicily—are rock stars. For those who aren’t here just to catch a glimpse of (actual rock star) Murphy mid-wine-swirl, this is really what’s drawing the crowd.
Also Nick Curtola, who’s at work in the tiny, narrow kitchen in the back. He used to work at Franny’s, so you’ll see a bit of that familiar, vibrant, Brooklyn-Italian style in the dishes—but there’s something more loose and spontaneous about it. For a while, there were tiny meatballs made from aged beef, coated in a bright fish sauce dressing with tons of raw herbs, which tasted like something you’d buy for lunch from a street vendor in Bangkok. A surprisingly complex cucumber salad with summer squash and herbs also includes caramelized onions. Although the beef tartare with sesame crackers looks somewhat lean and Scandinavian, it’s actually nice and fatty, full of flavor and texture. This style of food suits the vibe of the room. It’s better than good but without showing off—a little bit freestyle.
You can graze on just a few things, so many of the smaller dishes under $10 are exactly the kinds of snacks you want to nibble with a glass of wine—a bowl full of warm olives, some soft pork terrine with pickled cauliflower and toast, fried potatoes with plenty of aioli. Or you can make a meal out of a couple of larger dishes, like the roast chicken—in pieces but still on the bone, on a lovely mess of apricots and toasted bread, with dressed herbs. The pork sausages with big, crisp, frilly lettuces dressed in crème fraîche make up the kind of salad that satisfies enough to count as a light dinner, especially if you do yourself the favor of ordering the chilled fromage blanc for dessert.
Of course, you expect a good soundtrack and sound system here—it’s a vintage McIntosh that Murphy bought on EBay. But what’s great about Four Horsemen is the attention to detail, to all the stuff that really, truly makes an evening better: Along with the music, you can also hear your friends (Murphy installed 
. You’re not expected to wait hours for a table; you can just go online and reserve one like a normal human person.
You could say the restaurant’s focus is on esoteric natural wines and small plates, but that wouldn’t be quite right. It’s the kind of restaurant that reminds you that esoteric natural wines and little plates of food are, when you’re doing it right, not taking up too much of your attention. They’re just another way to have a good time.

=== Title: At Cafe ArtScience, a Food Futurist Experiments - Bloomberg ===

The best drink to order at Café ArtScience isn’t listed on the menu. That doesn’t stop regulars from sidling up to the bar at the Cambridge (Mass.) restaurant and ordering the Scotch tasting flight. To make it, bartender Todd Maul produces a special carafe, into which he pours a few peaty whiskies. The device then transforms the liquor into diaphanous fog. When you sip the vapor through the vessel’s glass straw, it has the same taste and smell as regular Scotch but none of the calories, intoxication effects, or subsequent hangover. The wafting cloud—Scotch as it may be—has been denatured of its alcohol.
The carafe, dubbed Le Whaf, is one of the latest creations from David Edwards, a Harvard engineering professor whose work focuses on using air to improve health. In recent years he’s become obsessed with nutrition, creating things like inhalable chocolate and edible water bottles. He teaches only one semester-long class each year: How to Create Things and Have Them Matter, in which 20 students focus on producing “an innovation that in some clear way benefits the world.” With his Moses hair style and collection of floral-printed shirts, he rarely passes as an academic.
Café ArtScience is his first restaurant. It’s also a showroom for his inventions. As you enter the modernist space, which opened in October, fluorescent-lit shelves show off Les Whafs, on sale for $225. Next to them are pods of $7.99 dietary supplements that, when placed in aerosol canisters, administer puffs of melatonin or caffeine to the lungs. “I’m able to deliver nutrition without any of the side effects that are sometimes associated with drinking a Red Bull,” Edwards brags.
At the freezers near the bar, customers use tongs to pluck out $1.99 spheres of ice cream. The size of golf balls, these WikiPearls, as they’re called, are wrapped like grapes in a flavored skin that helps frozen liquids keep their shape as they melt. “Edwards comes to a problem and really wants to get to the truth,” says Terry McGuire of Polaris Partners, who invested in the pearls. “From a collaborative perspective, that’s empowering.” In 2014, Edwards and his investors—including other venture capital firms such as Flagship Ventures and Unigestion—licensed the technology to organic yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm. In October the company started distributing WikiPearl frozen yogurt to 38 Whole Foods stores.
Despite its retail element, Café ArtScience also functions as a proper restaurant. Sharing its Kendall Square neighborhood with satellite offices for Google, Microsoft, and Akamai Technologies, it draws in Boston’s technology Brahmin, as well as professors from MIT and Harvard, which are a few miles away. The chef, Patrick Campbell, who came on board from Boston’s Eastern Standard, makes contemporary French fare such as Nantucket Bay scallops in a salt cod velouté. Only rarely does he use Edwards’s inventions in his kitchen, but he’s begun playing around; eventually, he says, he wants Le Whaf to lend complementary tastes to certain dishes. Maul, the cocktail maestro, has experimented a bit more. When Edwards hired him in November, he was already well known for using centrifuges, vaporizers, and other lab equipment at Boston’s Clio restaurant.
Molecular gastronomy has been a culinary gimmick since at least the mid-1990s, as chefs including Ferran Adria (Madrid), José Andrés (Washington), Grant Achatz (Chicago), and Wylie Dufresne (New York) began cooking with butane burners, dehydrators, hot-infusion siphons, and other tools that were once meant for chemistry labs. As the cuisine has gone in and out of style in the past two decades, scientists themselves have started trying to revolutionize the way we consume food. Soylent, for instance, reduces meals to a $4 nutritional shake to save time and money. Beyond Meat, an upstart making fake chicken strips from plant protein, has recently received an investment from Bill Gates. This year about a half-dozen other companies have tried to fine-tune new forms of ingesting melatonin and insulin.
Few have aimed to capture the sensorial experience of food—what Edwards calls the “head experience”—while cutting out the actual eating and drinking. “Your first adopters are going to be a certain kind of people,” he says from a dining room that’s stark white, with exposed ceiling pipes, marble tabletops, moss-green velvet banquettes, and honeycomb-shaped light fixtures. “This aesthetic is designed to make them feel welcome.” One frequent customer is Tim Rowe, founder of the Cambridge Innovation Center, who says the restaurant works because the science part is approachable. “It’s not this highbrow food as chemistry,” he adds. Edwards says Café ArtScience brings in $10,000 to $15,000 a day—the average entrée is $22—and he’s on track to pay back its five outside investors in two years. Prime dinner reservations have been tough to get since it opened.
People haven’t always responded so warmly to Edwards’s work. In 2010 he was interviewed on a French TV show about his edible bottles, made from a natural membrane held together by electrostatic forces. The pear-shaped product was still in its nascent phase; you bit the top off to drink from it. When he arrived on the set, Edwards was groggy with jet lag, having just flown into Paris, his second home, from Cambridge. A curtain pulled open to reveal 10 volunteers, who burst into uncomfortable laughter while handling the jiggling bottle. “Doing something in the lab is one thing,” he says. “But it’s very hard to bring those innovations immediately into a mass-market setting.”
After that, he realized the need to test his products on potential customers. So in 2007 he opened Le Laboratoire in Paris, which functions as a gallery and retail space. Café ArtScience is an extension of that—Edwards was originally courted to set up shop in Cambridge by BioMed Realty, a life-science real estate company that was looking to keep its building buzzing at night. Next door to the restaurant, Edwards brokered a lease for a gallery, which has become a U.S. version of Le Labo. He rents it out occasionally for events but mostly uses it to stage free scientific exhibitions. The inaugural show, open through March, features works by MIT Media Lab’s Neri Oxman and Tod Machover, who explore how hearing familiar voices influences mental and physical health.
Edwards, 53, doesn’t need these businesses to make much money. One of his projects already made him rich. In 1997, working with MIT professor Robert Langer, he developed a whiffle-ball-like particle that could carry insulin to the lungs, potentially allowing diabetics to avoid annoying injections. In 1999 their startup, Advanced Inhalation Research, was bought by the biopharmaceutical company Alkermes for $114 million in stock. After that, “investors and bankers cared a lot more about what I was saying than any audience that had ever listened to me in my academic days,” Edwards says. “People were truly betting on [my] ideas.”
Ultimately, the inhalable insulin concept didn’t pan out. By the time it passed pharmaceutical trials, it was so costly to administer that health insurers wouldn’t cover it. This soured Edwards’s interest in medicine. “Having to go through regulatory bodies and major corporations before people can actually use this stuff is a big liability,” he says.
He began focusing instead on less-regulated substances, such as vitamins and food. Even so, his inventions haven’t always passed muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 2012 the agency claimed that his Aeroshot caffeine inhaler was misbranded as a dietary supplement. By definition, the FDA charged, a dietary supplement had to be ingested, not inhaled. The product is still sold, though it’s now described as an “air-based nutritional supplement.”
Eventually, after items like the Aeroshot are critiqued by diners at Café ArtScience, Edwards hopes more supermarkets and food emporiums will start stocking them. This summer a line of coconut milk WikiPearls (free of dairy and other potential allergens) will hit shelves at Dave’s Fresh Marketplace, an independent chain of New England grocery stores.
Edwards is also tinkering with noningestible toys. The latest, called the oPhone, is a joint creation with a former student, 24-year-old Rachel Field, that lets users tag messages with scents and send them around the Web. Like Proust with his famous madeleine, Edwards wants to explore the link between aroma and memory—he thinks it could have value in the field of virtual reality. The $149 device, which will start shipping in April, includes various scented chips that when heated send brief whiffs of roses or brown sugar through a handset. The team is also developing an oBook, a children’s storybook app connected to an odor-emitting oPhone, to update ’80s scratch-and-sniff technology.
Of course, there’s an oPhone to test out at Café ArtScience. There, you use it to smell coffee beans from the premium French roaster Coutume before ordering an espresso drink. It’s not perfect yet. The first “aroma tweet,” sent last June, was supposed to call to mind Champagne and macarons, but it smelled more like a Hershey’s bar. Edwards still has hope, he says. “Any innovation is going to get it wrong before getting it right.”
 

=== Title: Baselworld 2016 Preview: What Is the Future of Watches? - Bloomberg ===

Since March 2015, exports of luxury watches from Switzerland 
. In January, the value totaled 1.5 billion Swiss francs, which is down 7.9 percent from the same month a year earlier.
The dampening factors are well-known, starting with the spike in relative value of the franc after Switzerland's central bank 
 in January 2015 and stopped pegging its own currency to the euro. To the rest of the world, suddenly Swiss watches became more expensive, while not much within the Swiss manufactures had actually changed. Followed by extreme global market uncertainty later in the year, and China's slowdown, the combined effect was tough for an industry that had previously been on something of a roll.
And yet, international luxury watch and jewelry brands will gather at 
 this coming week in Basel, Switzerland, to show off their wares and try to gin up excitement for the coming year. We've been seeing a trickle of previews from companies large and small, and it looks like the major brands are still traveling in 
 as last year: experimenting with new materials, tiptoeing into the smartwatch world, and attempting to excite with new colors and skeletonized faces. 
This is because watches take years to develop, and because riffing on past successes is what these brands do best. But journalists, who travel from appointment to appointment over the eight-day fair, will be wondering about the future of the industry. The questions on their lips: Are you going to change your pricing? Are you going to make more watches at entry-level price points?
According to a Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry report (
), exports of watches made of gold and other precious metals declined 14 percent in January alone, steel watches and steel alloy watches only declined 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively. The latter could be a bright spot for many watch brands facing a retrenchment among their ultrahigh-net-worth clientele. The introductory luxury timepieces still have opportunities among the growing Chinese middle class and an American upper middle class that is saving money on gas and enjoying a strong dollar.
On the flip side, at the very lowest end, exports of watches in the 200- to 400-franc range ($203 to $408) also slumped 12 percent. That's the price range of an 
 and comparable smartwatches, which have been giving quartz watches a run for their money.
Regardless of whether the brands will find a sweet spot in terms of price, and will evolve in the face of changing global financial conditions, what we've seen so far from sneak previews is promising in terms of technology and aesthetics. There will be a lot of exciting watches on the market this year. Here are a few.
 
One of the many watches to debut at Baselworld that will experiment with rare and proprietary materials, this elegant Seamaster from Omega is small enough to be called "unisex" (39.5mm) and boasts a new movement for the series. The black enamel face and bezel is an attractive match with Omega’s proprietary pink Sedna Gold—an alloy of gold, copper, and palladium that's scratch-resistant and less likely to suffer from discoloration. 
 
Even if you don't know Jaquet Droz watches, you'll notice immediately that the simple face here features a figure-eight pattern in the overlapping hour-and-minutes dial and seconds dial. The JD watches have proved very popular in China because of exactly this—the layout looks like a lucky number eight. This "Off-Centered" version is a new design, though the automatic movement is the same as in previous brand models. In this model, the polished black onyx face adds a modern sleekness. 
 
While Bulgari's new women's watch, the Diva's Dream, is powered by a quartz movement, it's hard not to get titillated by so many diamonds handled in such an elegant, straightforward way. Here, the Diva's Dream dial consists of 233 brilliant-cut pavé diamonds and blued hands. The straps are satin, but you could replace them with whatever you like and still have a showstopper.
 
This manual flyback chronograph and perpetual calendar is a new addition to Chopard's L.U.C line of watches. It's made with Fairmined 18-karat white gold (ethically sourced from mines in South America), and the Calibre 03.10-L movement is structured around a column wheel that serves as the backbone of all the chronograph operations. Only 20 will be made.
 
This partially skeletonized watch is another experiment with an unusual material: titanium. While the metal is light, strong, and resistant to scratches, it's just not common in high-end luxury timepieces. The movement is also rare—it features a chain-and-fusee style constant force system, and the winding is not accomplished through a crown, but rather a pusher.

=== Title: Eight Beers to Drink This Summer That Aren’t IPAs - Bloomberg ===

It's hot, it's humid, and you want some suds. Do you really need another semi-chilled IPA?  Hops are great for adding bitterness and acidic flavors to beer, but if you consume too much at this time of year, you end up with a dry mouth instead of that clean refreshment you're looking for. Here are eight craft alternatives for summer's warmest months.
When you think of wheat beers, you probably think of something yellow, a little bready, and wrongfully served with a slice of orange plonked in the glass. 
 will destroy your preconceptions. The wheat base is brewed with an ale yeast and has that signature smooth body, but it's then hopped like a pale ale so you get more grapefruit and pepper than banana and clove. It'll start disappearing from shelves as Labor Day approaches. If you're smart, you'll grab a few extra six-packs for early fall.
 
This beer is a strange beast brewed with five kinds of malt, including oats and rye, plus four types of hops and four types of yeast. At its core, 
 is basically a unique style of saison, or French farmhouse-style beer. It's bright gold in color and has a soapy head that tempers a hefty dose of carbonation that borders on soda territory. There's a big hit of lemon up front, followed by what can only be described as wet dirt and tree bark. You might not know that you like those flavors. One sip, and you will.
 
Gose is a style that's been surging in popularity over the last year or two—and for good reason. They're sour beers brewed with salt, some of which lingers in every sip. 
 is a light version of the style and a good intro if you haven't strayed too far into lip-pucker territory yet. It's a strange flavor and one that shouldn't work, but it does—and you won't be able to put the stuff down. Plus it comes in skinny cans that look as if they're ready for the beach (which is exactly where this should be drunk).
 
Some of the best Belgian-style beers in the U.S. are made on a farm tucked into the side of a hill in upstate New York. 
 is a basic amber with orange peel, grains of paradise, and lavender added during the brewing process. It might sound more like a bowl of potpourri than a glass of beer, but you won't pick any of those notes out individually. Instead, Rare Vos has enough body to be satisfying, enough fruitiness to be refreshing, and enough spiciness to keep it from getting cloying when you're throwing it back under the sun.
 
Yes, this is a fruit-infused wheat beer. It might even be my favorite beer on this list. St. Louis's Schlafly brewing makes a 
 that has none of the artificial sweetness of its competitors and forces you to stop and think about what you're tasting, instead of guessing raspberry lemonade. It's dry, it's thirst quenching, and it's a good enough reason for a Midwestern road trip all. Skeptics, take note.
 
The 
 gets all the attention for Goose Island, but the Chicago brewery's lighter, easier to find offerings are every bit as good. 
 is a saison aged in wine barrels on top of orange peels, giving it a slightly funky edge. The barrels add some faint vanilla to the finish, while up front, you get all the awesome spice and citrus you want from a farmhouse ale. The carbonation is fine and even; comparisons to Champagne are totally fair.
 
Most of this list is light, easy drinking beer, but even when it's hot outside, you sometimes want a kick in the pants. 
 is the answer to that day-drunk urge. The Canadian interpretation of a Belgian Tripel is 9 percent alcohol; it has a creamy mouth feel and tiny bubbles that add just enough levity to the hefty brew. It tastes of tropical fruits, fresh baked brioche, and bright pink bubble gum. You get a little zip of alcohol in the aftertaste, reminding you that this isn't a smoothie.
 
Sometimes a good ol' fashioned pilsner is the best thing for the job. Easy drinking doesn't get any easier than this, though there are tons of metallic-tasting, corn-packed pilsners out there that you want to avoid. Pennsylvania's Victory Brewing has basically perfected the style with 
. It smells like fresh-cut grass sprinkled over a bowl of Cheerios and the flavor is a mix of citrus, green apple, and crackers, finishing smooth and just sweet enough to make you want more. 

=== Title: Paris Restaurant’s London Outpost Plans 110 Wines by the Glass - Bloomberg ===

The two-Michelin-star Paris restaurant 
 plans to open a London brasserie at  which 110 wines will be available by the glass.
, on Cavendish Square, will serve classic French cuisine in a smart brasserie where pairings will be offered at a range of prices likely to start at about £5 ($7.80) a glass. It will serve all day, including breakfast.
Restaurants from France have had a rough ride in London, where 
arrived this month to mixed reviews. Even Alain Ducasse faced criticism when he opened at the Dorchester.
"It's a big challenge to settle in London," says Laurent Gardinier, who heads the Taillevent group with his brothers, Thierry and Stephane. "We don't want to be arrogant. We're bringing French gastronomic food from Paris to here, but we're going to adapt it to what London people like."
Taillevent has hired London veterans to run the brasserie. General manager Giuseppe Dewilde's resume includes the Bleeding Heart, Cafe Royal, Quaglino's, Bluebird, Le Pont de la Tour, and Bentley's. Head chef Robert Panek has worked at the Don, Le Pont de la Tour, Etihad Airways, Bob Bob Ricard, and Bluebird Café.
Prices have yet to be confirmed for Les 110 de Taillevent, which is scheduled to open later in the year. The brothers expect average spending of about £70 a person. A prix fixe menu will be available at lunch and dinner and may cost about £35.
A Wine Time menu with small plates will be served at the bar in the early evening. The à la carte menu is by Alain Solivérès, executive chef director of Taillevent Paris; the wine list is by Pierre Bérot, cellar director of Taillevent Paris. The designs are by Pierre-Yves Rochon and refer to wine production.
Laurent and Thierry Gardinier tell us they have dined in many London restaurants to better understand the city. They mention Pollen Street Social, Quaglino's, Hakkasan, Le Gavroche, the Wolseley, Chavot, La Petite Maison, and Roka.
"We want to see how is the market, what is the scene?" says Laurent. "The level is very high. The London scene is more open to foreign experience than Paris because the tradition of the English gastronomy by itself is not the same as the French gastronomic tradition. Also, people are more curious in London."
Are the brothers expecting to attract a lot of French guests?
"We're not creating a restaurant for the French," Thierry says. "We want a restaurant for London people. If the French come, we are happy, but it's not done for them."

=== Title: How to Judge a Great Wine List, According to Critic Elin McCoy - Bloomberg ===

For weeks I’ve been combing through hundreds of wine lists from restaurants around the globe in my role as judge for the 
’s annual wine list awards.
My first takeaway: The heavy leather-bound wine tome stuffed with staid, predictable reds and whites is, happily, in deep decline, if not a fossil.
Deconstructing the elements that make one list great and another completely mediocre, I realized a brilliant selection of wines was only part of what I was looking for.
Fairly quickly I developed a surprisingly long list of pet peeves: misspelled wine names, missing vintages, preachy essays, exorbitant pricing, and stupid jokes and comments. No one really wants to know that a guest at Scottsdale’s Cowboy Ciao described its list as “better than pornography.”
My first criteria are simpler than you might think, really: readability, accuracy, and a clear, attractive, user-friendly format. This is harder to find than you might think; aiming for an oh-so-hip design, some lists fail these tests miserably. Who can decipher complicated wine names at a dimly lit table if they’re crowded together and printed in pale gray micro-type? If it takes me more than a minute or two to locate, say, a delicious, inexpensive Burgundy, the list got dismissed.
Whether they include 200 wines or 5,000, my top lists have all the basic categories as well as something good in each: by-the-glass, sparkling, dessert, as well as main sections devoted to whites, rosés, and reds. Some lists forget about rosés (except in summer, of course), while others pack the sparkling section with big-brand fizz, ignoring many increasingly popular small growers.
I still prefer organization by region rather than grape variety, but I appreciate recent attempts to liven things up by flavor profile. The “Low Grip, High Pleasure” section at Boulder, Colo.’s innovative Frasca is one example. (In case you’re wondering, that includes pinot noir, barbera, and rosé.)
By-the-glass selections are, thankfully, getting longer and the good restaurants long ago ditched boring, overpriced pinot grigios and ubiquitous sauvignon blancs. Like curious wine lovers who view ordering a single glass as a cheap way to try something new or special, I look for a minimum of 25 choices that encompass unusual finds to tempt the adventurous as well as at least a few big-deal labels.
Coravin technology, for example, now makes it possible for the NoMad in New York to offer $60 glasses of 1995 Château Gruaud-Larose. When a restaurant offers pours in several sizes, as does London’s 28-50, that’s a plus, too.
Yes, the wine selections should match the style of the restaurant’s food, but I was also sniffing out the breadth, diversity, and depth in regions, styles, flavors, and vintages of the choices. I hope to find at least a few trophy wines, off-the-beaten-path surprises, and hot deals under $60, too. Often these are from little-known grapes or regions or from a new label, like the Calder Wine Co.’s 2013 Rachel Rossi riesling at Pearl & Ash ($45).
Top steakhouse lists have to go beyond the stereotypical, big, whack-you-in-the-face reds to get my nod. One welcome surprise was the number of Italian restaurants in the U.S. with stellar selections of classic and grower Champagnes.
 
Just as an exciting food menu reflects the specific talents of a great chef, an exciting wine list has to ooze personality and a distinct point of view. The mission at Napa Valley’s Press restaurant is to offer older vintages of the best local wines. Terroir Tribeca’s list is a provocative, edgy wine manifesto championing riesling and predicting the next classics.
I hunted for what was unique and special. New York’s Casa Mono trumpets its fine sherry selection and the 200 rieslings at Australian restaurant Jonah’s show the passion of its German sommelier.
Lists seem to be getting shorter, more concise and creative, which is merciful when you just want to pick something quickly. And careful selections can easily trump sheer size.
Still, I admit I gave my highest marks to a few massive lists packed with dozens of vintages of blue chips like Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. These signal a shock-and-awe wine destination and should always come prefaced with a table of contents. Palais Coburg in Vienna, for example, has a list that’s a collectors’ fantasy of indulgence, with 100 vintages of Château d’Yquem, old bottles of first-growth Bordeaux, Spain’s Vega Sicilia, Italy’s Ornellaia, and Napa Valley’s rare Diamond Creek single-vineyard cabernets, among many, many others.
I’m also a fan of wine lists that look for ways to broaden knowledge without trying to instruct. The aforementioned Jonah’s helpfully includes attractive maps of the Rhine, while New York’s Lincoln features mini-sections showing off a particular vineyard, vintage, producer, and grape variety. Tasting notes, as long as they are informative and brief, can be useful.
 
Yes, I know. Time to discuss pricing.
Feeling ripped off definitely takes away from dining pleasure, so I looked for value for money. Many of the lists I compared included some of the same wines, and I was unpleasantly surprised by vast differences in price.
It’s true that restaurants may pay different amounts for the same wine, depending on when they purchase it and how many cases they buy. But pricing strategies vary widely. Though standard markup starts at about double retail, some restaurants charge much more.
Get this: In New York City, you’ll pay $250 for Krug Grande Cuvée Champagne at Morrell’s Wine Bar, and more than double that, $540, at Per Se. At retail shops? It’s about $150.
This week, wine-focused Rebelle restaurant opens on the Bowery in New York with 200 labels on the list that cost under $50. I drink to that.

=== Title: Drink This Now: Hard Cider That Is as Sophisticated as Wine - Bloomberg ===

On a recent trip to Portland, Ore., I found myself standing around a crowded bar called 
, shoulder-to-shoulder with some burly, bearded beer guys intently sipping and dissecting small pours of straw-colored liquid. I was in town for the annual Craft Brewers Conference, but this wasn’t beer that I was tasting. It was dry, crisp hard cider at the country’s first cider-only bar, which opened in 2010.
Since then, bars such as 
 in Seattle, 
 in San Francisco, and 
 in Asheville, N.C., have restored the beverage to its original place on the American table, propelling it into a new phase of popularity. Cider was, after all, the drink this nation was originally built on, with Johnny Appleseed planting orchards for hard cider production all across the country. But post-Prohibition, many cider orchards and breweries were abandoned or destroyed. Now, with roughly 350 cider producers in the U.S.—most of whom make small-batch ciders—the drink has never been more popular.
According to an 
 market-research report, cider is currently the fastest-growing segment of beer and malt beverage marketing, with sales increasing 75 percent in 2014. Granted, most of those sales were from mass-produced ciders like Strongbow, Smith & Forge, and Hornsby’s, but hey, you’ve got to start somewhere.
“Nationwide, cider is often viewed as a sweet, gluten-free alternative to beer,” says Ben Sandler, co-owner of the month-old 
, Manhattan’s cider-centric bar and restaurant that opened in April on the Lower East Side. “People think of it as a sugary alcoholic beverage, on par with wine coolers.”
“But that’s not real cider,” Sandler says, “and those aren’t the types of cider that we’re interested in.”
The types of ciders you 
 find at Wassail—those “real” ciders, like the ones I was sampling with the beer nerds at Bushwacker that afternoon—are terroir-driven examples made on farmsteads among orchards, often tasting like unadorned expressions of the apples grown in their respective regions. Imagine the tang of a ripe, tart apple resting on old leather, or the smell of a dense apple orchard, a cool fall breeze blowing through the gnarled branches and fruits rotting softly underfoot. 
... breathe it in.
Like biodynamic wines, many good ciders are naturally fermented, produced with minimal interference and low technology. Most are clean and dry-tasting like a crisp white wine, but sometimes they’re unfiltered with a funky, farmhouse ale-like undercurrent from wild yeast strains. Some even take cues from craft beer, spending time in bourbon or wine barrels or getting steeped with whole-cone or pelletized hops (a technique known as dry-hopping). These modern ciders appeal more and more to serious beer and wine enthusiasts. 
Back home in New York a few weeks later, I visited Sandler and Jennifer Lim, his business partner and wife, at their new cider house, located appropriately enough on bustling (wait for it) Orchard Street.
 
“We’d been developing the idea for a couple of years at our other bar, the Queens Kickshaw,” says Lim, “and we knew that an all-cider place would be something unique. We heard about Upcider and Bushwacker and thought, New York City deserves a full-on, geeked-out cider bar.”
Cider has routinely received curt treatment in New York. On restaurant menus it’s usually an afterthought, relegated to a small corner on the last page (if available at all). And at bars it’s the thin, pale beverage poured into a fingerprint-smudged shaker pint—served flat and insipid—that no one ever really wants to drink if they don’t have to.
Wassail flips this script, putting serious ciders as the focus in a wine bar-like atmosphere. There are six by-the-glass pours (from a selection of rotating bottles) and more than 50 other large-format bottles available, in addition to a dozen varieties on draft (5- to 12-ounce pours, served in Champagne coupes or white wine-style glasses). Lim and Sandler’s list includes varieties from more far-flung places like Switzerland, Italy, and even Chile. But at its core are modern American ciders, most from regions up and down the Eastern Seaboard.  
 
As a fan of Finger Lakes wines, I was excited to find ciders from that area, such as Eve’s, Black Diamond, and RedByrd. I also recognized some of my favorite ciders from the Hudson Valley, like Aaron Burr and Wayside, as well as varieties from further south, including Foggy Ridge in Virginia and Millstone in Maryland. Bottles start at $15 and range up to $88, for the Maley Cidre du Mont Blanc from Valle d’Aosta, Italy.
 
Because of their broad, unobtrusive flavors—often with a hint of fresh lemon peel and bright acidity—and clean, dry finishes, many of these ciders pair well with food. In fact, Wassail serves a full menu composed of vegetable dishes like cauliflower with black garlic and cashews, or leeks with spaetzle, garlic scapes, and truffles.
At Wassail you can see that cider has come a long way, that it’s no longer tossed off as a second-rate beverage. And there are other indicators that this could be the year of cider in New York. Places such as 
, 
, and 
 now have cider lists more than 20 bottles deep. And Brooklyn-based 
, an all-cider distributor, is serving the city with more than a hundred options from all over the U.S. and Europe.
Some ciders are better cold, others at room temperature. As a rule of thumb, I think of sparkling natural ciders as great spring and summer drinks because they benefit from being chilled down, ice-cold, in a big Champagne bucket and served in either elegant coupe glasses or petite tumblers. On the other hand, I treat still (noncarbonated) ciders like red wines and serve them just below room temperature, swirled in a voluminous wine glass, alongside a savory bite of pungent cheese or musky cured meats.
As the cider warms in its glass, complexities and nuances unfurl, developing and changing with almost every sip.
(Delhi, N.Y.)
Briefly aged in oak barrels, this refreshing cider from the Hudson Valley is snappy but mellow, with layers of dry, oaky complexity. 
 (Burlington, Vt.)
Packed in 16-oz. tall-boy cans and 22-oz. bottles and aggressively dry-hopped with floral New Zealand-grown Nelson Sauvin hops, Full Nelson is bracing with a lemony white wine-like fruitiness. 
 (Monkton, Md.)
Millstone’s Cobbler is a fruited blend of natural cider and bourbon barrel-aged peach wine, with notes of candied peach, vanilla, and plum. 
 (Fennville, Mich.)
A blend of aged and new ciders, The Mitten is woodsy and dank with flavors of vanilla, honey, and earth. 
 (Queens, N.Y.)
Based in Queens’s Ridgewood neighborhood, Descendant is New York City’s one and only cider distillery. Pom Pomme is a surprisingly dry (not sweet) rosé cider spiked with tart pomegranate and hibiscus flowers. 
Outside of NYC these limited-production ciders may be hard to track down, so pounce when you see them. 
 and 
 both have great cider selections otherwise and will ship to any state that allows alcohol deliveries.

=== Title: From a Messy Start, London’s Le Chabanais Emerges Triumphant - Bloomberg ===

The opening of Le Chabanais was like an Andy Warhol artwork. And I don't mean a Campbell's soup can. 
I'm referring to the car-crash prints, with battered bodies thrown clear of tangled wreckage.
Excitement had surrounded the news in November that Inaki Aizpitarte was planning a restaurant in London. The Basque chef is revered for Le Chateaubriand, a funky venue in Paris that combines creative gastronomy with a slice of attitude.
Then things started to go wrong.
The London opening slipped by months, as happens. Le Chabanais then started taking bookings and invited in guests for previews. A few days on, it closed again because of malfunctioning extraction (ventilation) equipment. All reservations were canceled.
It was around this stage it emerged that Kevin Lansdown, the former general manager of Scott's in Mayfair who was overseeing Le Chabanais, planned to leave. When I finally arrived for lunch at the start of this month, Chef Aizpitarte wasn't even in the U.K.
And so, finally, to the food: My expectations were not high, but it turned out to be surprisingly good.
This shouldn't really be such a wonder, as Le Chateaubriand’s head chef, Paul Boudier, is in charge. It's the dissonance between a kitchen that's firing on all cylinders and a restaurant that isn't that creates the confusion.
The cooking is modern French: not modern as in crazy look-at-me dishes in search of attention, like a soap star in the 
 house or a politician's pledges chiseled in stone. It's gastronomy that is eclectic and inventive while retaining focus.
Take a dish such as Basque squid stew, at 9 pounds ($14). This relatively simple starter with tomatoes, onions, and garlic, packs a punch in terms of flavor. The squid is stewed in its own ink, for a dark and alluring dish whose distinctive taste is amplified by pepper, wine, and a hint of vinegar.
Chicken liver ravioli (12 pounds) is served in a fennel broth, the translucent pasta stuffed with herbs and meat; it's fresh-tasting and surprisingly light. Quail is cooked in tandoori spices and topped with a yogurt whose sourness complements the sweetness of the flesh and the spiciness of the seasoning. 
The mains come loaded with vegetation, which adds to the visual appeal and the freshness but does mean you have to get a little interactive if you want to track down that veal sweetbread lurking within the smoked aubergine and elderflower, or the flavorsome lamb that is lost in the spring salad and feta.
I enjoy the buttermilk ice cream dessert as much as anything on the menu. It's dreamy creamy and washed with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of lemon thyme.
The kitchen is employing great ingredients and turning out dishes that are technically refined. Le Chabanais brings to London an individual style of French gastronomy that is quirky and attractive without being overly challenging. 
I know diners who have visited Le Chabanais expecting rock 'n' roll and been disappointed to find something softer and gentler. (Except for the washroom, whose raunchy look is a reminder that the restaurant is named after a Paris bordello.) Those patrons anticipated Keith Moon and ended up spending the night with Phil Collins. Something happened on the way to heaven; the food crowd wanted a rude bistro and got a polite restaurant.
The dishes are sufficiently distinctive to make a visit worthwhile. Whether you will want to go back may depend on how the front of house settles in. In the early days, Le Chabanais felt posh in a not-very-welcoming Mayfair way.
The striking design—with brass panels on the walls and floor—is attractive yet cold. The service style doesn't help.
When I visited, staffers were variously staring at computers, polishing glasses, checking receipts, and holding meetings.
The poet John Milton wrote: "They also serve who only stand and wait." Please note: This maxim does not apply in restaurants.
Le Chabanais is at 8 Mount Street, Mayfair, London, W1K 3NF; +44-20-7491-7078 or

=== Title: The Most Exciting New Wines and Spirits From VinExpo 2015 - Bloomberg ===

Fireworks spread like giant golden fans across the night sky above Château Smith Haut Lafitte at the party kickoff for last week’s VinExpo 2015, the world’s largest wine and spirits trade fair.
The biannual gathering is a big deal. French President François Hollande gave a speech the next day at one of the vast exhibition spaces on a man-made lake just north of the city. VinExpo is the drink industry’s biannual five-day schmoozefest, a place to do deals, trade gossip, party hard, and, of course, launch new products. 
I spent my days hiking from one end of the half-mile-long hall to the other, hunting the highlights among the 2,350 exhibitors from 42 countries. One fast fact: It takes 50 people to keep the 120,000 glasses clean for sniffing and swirling by 48,000 buyers, who flew in from 151 countries. After France, China topped the list for number of visitors.
Trendy rosés were ubiquitous, but “taste the unexpected” was this year’s theme, and I found plenty of that, from Latvian bitters to Riedel glasses that show off espresso’s different flavors, to wines from war-torn Syria. 
Here are my picks for some of the most exciting launches:  
Aging wine under water? It’s a thing now, at least in the case of a zingy, lemony, and salty Loire valley sauvignon blanc and chardonnay blend. The winemakers attribute its surprising flavor intensity to their practice of bottle-aging it 15 meters below the surface of the Atlantic.  In a taste test against the same wine aged in a cellar, the ocean-aged example had deeper texture and more saltiness. Or was that the power of suggestion? The bottle, encrusted with barnacles, comes in a wooden box. Only 1,000 cases were made. You won’t find it in the U.S., as government killjoys worry that the aging process may pose a health hazard.
 
At a popup cocktail bar called Spiritual (get it?), a rotating group of American bartenders were mixing drinks to show off various new spirits, such as this new carrot liqueur from family-owned Wenneker distillery in the Netherlands. (Wenneker is one of the oldest Dutch distilleries and makes a wide range of flavored liqueurs—think blueberry and butterscotch—and premium spirits such as Elderflower Gin.) 
I was highly dubious at the idea of a vegetable liqueur, but its vibrant orange color, earthy aroma of fresh-picked carrots, and tangy, spicy taste won me over. Ditto the insouciant packaging in a jar. Mixed in a cocktail with curaçao orange liqueur, lime and lemon juice, and 7-up, it brought me “back to mother earth,” just as the brochure promised. 
 
“Argentina is more than malbec,” insisted Kaiken winemaker Aurelio Montes Junior as he splashed his brand-new soft, fragrant, herbaceous cabernet franc from Argentina’s Uco Valley into my glass. A photo showed his high-altitude vineyard filled with enormous rocks. He had to remove 2,500 truckfuls of them to plant vines. The other big problems he has are wild donkeys and huge ants.
I guess they’re lucky to have made four hundred cases.  This is a real find.
 
Chilean winery Santa Carolina was celebrating its 140
 anniversary by launching several wines, including this earthy, complex, silky-textured red made from grapes from the company’s oldest vineyards. 
It’s especially exciting because it’s an attempt to recreate wines such as Santa Carolina's still-fabulous 1959 cabernet by reviving 50-year-old winemaking techniques. The result is a Chilean red with the elegance and balance that has sadly been missing from the country’s flood of high-alcohol, overextracted “icon” wines. 
Burgundy purists dote on subtle taste differences among the region’s vineyards, and they’ll be aghast at this tradition-busting experiment from playful Jean-Charles Boisset, whose wine businesses span California and France. The heavy, square, clear bottle looks as if it should hold some ancient cognac. The red wine inside is a rich, lush blend from three famous grand cru Burgundy vineyards—Clos de Vougeot, Clos de la Roche, and Échezeaux—from three different vintages. It’s all highly refined cherry fruit and smooth, rich texture. There’s no terroir taste with this mélange, but it’s gorgeous in the glass and ready to drink now.
 
You don’t find every hot new wine launch in the VinExpo aisles, so nightly gossip at lavish chateau dinners cooked by Michelin-starred chefs is essential. At the international press dinner at Château Margaux (Guy Savoy was the chef), Jean-Guillaume Prats, president of Moet-Hennessy Estates & Wines, spilled details on the Chinese red the company expects to introduce this fall. 
The Bordeaux style blend is made at Shangri-La winery in the Himalayan foothills in the far west of Yunnan province. Grapes come from 320 tiny vineyards at altitudes of 2,300 to 2,600 meters, some of the highest in the world. The wine will be labeled Ao Yun, meaning Sacred Cloud. 
LVMH aims to make it the best red wine in China. Expect high-altitude prices.

=== Title: Heston Blumenthal’s Biggest Headache in Australia: Finding Snails for Porridge - Bloomberg ===

Heston Blumenthal tells a story of walking through Sydney and being stopped several times by fans wanting their photograph taken with him.
Finally, a family approached with the request for a picture. He passed the camera to his publicist and posed with them, only realizing from their surprised reaction they had no idea who he was and just wanted him to take their picture.
For all that, the British chef is a celebrity in Australia. He is best-known for his appearances on the hit TV show 
—including "Heston Week"—and his 
 food range.
Now, he is in the news for his restaurant the 
, which has opened for a six-month residency at the Crown Towers in Melbourne, and 
. Given that's a straight import, nothing translated or invented, my first question is ... why Australia, and specifically why Melbourne? 
‘‘Australia has had the biggest food explosion I’ve ever seen in the world," he says in an interview over lunch. "Look at what happened in Spain, say 15 years ago. That was a couple of handfuls of restaurants. But here they have just gone food crazy. Effectively, it was 
 that kicked that off five or six years ago. A lot of Australian chefs have done their time in some of the top restaurants in Europe and they are coming back, too. You see the benefits of that. 
"Melbourne is a great city. I get here, and I feel I can breathe." He says that for food, he considers Melbourne one of the world's top five or six cities. The others on the list are New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo/Kyoto.
Blumenthal's public image is of a boffin of food, developing dishes in his laboratory that owe as much to science as gastronomy. This isn't so far from the truth. Take a single example on his Fat Duck menu, the Red Cabbage Gazpacho with Pommery Grain Mustard Ice Cream.
He created the dish on the strength of the molecular similarities of diverse ingredients after discovering that mustard oil gives cabbage its peppery flavor, hence the mustard ice cream. Just don't go calling his style "molecular gastronomy," a 
.
If Blumenthal sometimes appears rather earnest on television, that's how he is when you meet him. I've interviewed him about a dozen times over the years, and he is good company, as happy to chat about sport and his love of table tennis as about restaurants and developments in cooking.
This time, the interview starts out over coffee at the Crown Towers and after an hour or so we decide to head out for lunch at 
, a fashionable eating house and bar on Flinders Lane in an old rag-trade building in Melbourne's art and fashion district.
We take a corner table and order small plates of oysters; sardine and pickled chili en croute; gazpacho, spanner crab and almond; wagyu bresaola; grilled ox tongue and mustard fruits; tuna tartare with crushed-green-pea salad; and baby iceberg, grapefruit, and dill.
"This is the first time I've got out of the hotel in a week," Blumenthal says over a bottle of By Farr 2010 Australian Chardonnay from Geelong after going for a chat with the chefs in the open kitchen.
The Fat Duck has come to Australia while the restaurant back home in Bray, west of London, is refurbished. It is a tiny establishment that has changed little since winning three Michelin stars and, in 2005, being voted 
. 
In particular, he's extending the kitchen, one of the smallest I've ever seen in an established restaurant.
Blumenthal says he considers cities such as New York and Dubai for the residency, but his first choice was Melbourne, where there is a fast-growing food culture and where he can readily source the top-quality ingredients needed for his cooking. The deep pockets of Crown Resorts Ltd. (
), which owns the hotel, may have had something to do it. Crown Resorts is a casino, entertainment, and hotel company controlled by the billionaire James Packer. There's been no announcement of what the move cost, but it can't have been cheap flying the entire 60-odd staff of the Fat Duck across the world for six months while also developing a network of suppliers for ingredients and wine.
‘‘I think of this as a migration," Blumenthal says. "The Duck’s gone away to get a bit—I was going to say fatter, but that sounds financial. It’s going to a spa and will come back relaxed and invigorated."
He's looking relaxed and invigorated himself. Blumenthal is a martial-arts enthusiastic and former debt collector. He's friendly and engaging but you wouldn't want to mess with him. At one stage over lunch he says he used to get into fights when he was younger. "Physical ones?" I ask in surprise. "Yeah," he says, looking puzzled that I need to ask."
Blumenthal’s announcement last year that he would temporarily move the Fat Duck to Australia was headline news. The only adverse reaction was to the price of a meal: Australians are no more used to paying A$525 ($408) per person for a meal than the rest of us. That didn’t stop more than 250,000 people trying for a table. 
‘‘It was a hard one,’’ Blumenthal says. ‘‘If we had to charge enough to claw back the cost of flying everyone over and setting up the restaurant, it would have been thousands, which we couldn’t do. But it’s still about 30-percent more than the next-most-expensive restaurant in Melbourne."
When the residency ends, the Fat Duck will go home to roost and the first overseas branch of 
will then move into the space.
‘‘Australia is a young and very multicultural country," he says. "Also, its geographic disconnection from the rest of the world means people want to absorb stuff. Foodwise, they are really up for trying new things and that has helped the whole restaurant scene.
‘‘I had a taxi driver telling me last year he’d invented an extra pocket in pita bread to put in fermented beetroot. Can you imagine a London cabbie doing that?’’
Blumenthal is full of praise for Australian produce and has tweaked his dishes to accommodate the different types of fish available locally. There has been just one snag: Finding the right kind of snail for his signature dish of snail porridge. Finally, he decided he would have to import them.
‘‘It’s ironic the thing that was hardest to pin down was the slowest moving,’’ he says, then breaks off as a diner approaches wanting a picture taken with him.

=== Title: Damien Hirst Opens Pharmacy 2 Restaurant in London - Bloomberg ===

Damien Hirst takes a second stab at the London restaurant business with the Tuesday opening of 
, in a room that looks half diner, half drug store.
The walls feature giant Hirst medical cabinets, the etched-glass windows depict DNA and the bar stools are pills ripe for popping. Above the bar is the single word, Prescriptions.
The counter is given over to a picture of tablets and capsules, while the glass top encases an array of syringes, tubing and latex gloves.
Pharmacy 2 is housed in Hirst's  
south of the River Thames. If the decor is prescription-led, the food is as accessible as aspirin. The restaurant is a collaboration with Mark Hix, a chef known for celebrating British ingredients and dishes. Here, the menu is more international, including north African brik fried pastry with duck egg and rose harissa.
That's in addition to the more distinctly British food such as a lamb pie, reminiscent of the
with rabbit and crayfish that was a hit when Hix opened 
restaurant in 2006. The chef was a late recruit to Pharmacy 2, whose name references both an artwork from 1992 and the Hirst-designed Pharmacy Restaurant & Bar, which was open from 1998 to 2003 in London's Notting Hill neighborhood.
"It was only a few months ago: I was on my scooter going through Mayfair and I saw Damien and Maia, his ex-wife, sitting outside Scott's," Hix said over a preview lunch at Pharmacy 2. "I went over and he said he needed a chef and I said, 'Why don't we go into a proper partnership?'" said Hix, who was responsible for the menus at 
and Scott's during his time as chef-director of 
.
"I've known Damien for 10, 15 years through the art world and mutual friends. And the thing is, he's always got into bed with chefs he doesn't know. So the minute I said that to him, I think he felt confident because he likes the food at Scott's and the Ivy in the old days, so he trusted what I was going to put on the menu.
"He leaves it to me because he knows my food, he knows the dishes. For me, that is the most important thing. There is no point doing it unless you have an understanding of who you are going into partnership with. Damien loves food. He knows what he wants. He's not an experimental food person. He likes simple, unfussy food, like we all do now, really. It's becoming an ingredient-led business." 
Hix is frank about the origins of his ideas for the dishes. A broth of Hunan spiced pork, celery and ginger is a homage to a starter at 
 restaurant in Pimlico; falafel, artichoke and broad-bean top salad was inspired by a visit to Lebanon;  heaven and earth features black pudding made by 
 bread & butter pudding references an Anton Mosimann recipe when Hix worked at 
.
Other dishes include 
 duck curry with a crispy apple pakora; and a light blood-orange and white-chocolate cheesecake. Mains start at £13.50 ($19) for Launceston lamb pie; the desserts (all miniature, with the idea you share a few) are £4.

=== Title: Three Global Hospitality Giants Merge for New Manhattan Dining Hotspot - Bloomberg ===

When fish and chips are done right, you don’t get the more aggressive crunch of perfect fried chicken. It’s a frothy, almost airy kind of chomp, ideally a little tangy with beer. 
, a swanky, stylish new restaurant on the second floor of the Met Life Building, gets it just right: A big piece of Icelandic cod is hot, cooked through, but extremely juicy.

Apart from the fish and chips, and a little Lancashire hotpot layered with threads of rabbit meat and tender potatoes, Atherton’s menu isn’t too obviously English, and the touches are well-integrated into a clubby, crowd-pleasing menu of cold dressed seafood and steaks.
But there are some surprises: In addition to a warm Bearnaise sauce in a silver gravy boat that accompanies the steaks, there might also be a bottle of HP Sauce—a downmarket British brown sauce made by Heinz, for which there are no substitutions. It’s essentially a steak sauce, tangy and sweet, ideal with breakfast sausages. Whether you want to dab any of it on your $52 strip steak is a personal question (I do, but only on the occasional bite).
The hotel, 
, is an Ian Schrager joint that opened in May. Everything is luxuriously designed, creamy and beige and soft. To get to the restaurant on the second floor is a glowing white spiral staircase that feels like climbing through the inner ear of a gigantic creature from a lost episode of 
. The restaurant upstairs has the look of an old New York club, with every bit of wall space covered with gold-framed celebrity portraits—Al Green, Bob Dylan, all the beautiful people in their youth, preening in front of hotel room mirrors or smoking on the backs of motorcycles. The restaurant itself, a series of interconnected parlor rooms (including one purple billiard room and a sparkly gold bar) is quite good looking—and wooden blinds keep the place shaded and dim, even in the middle of the day. 
At lunchtime, you’ll see a range of hotel guests and diners straight out of their offices on Madison Square Park, a mix of tourists and New Yorkers—the summer goths in from L.A., closing a deal on their cell phones with tattooed hands and crystal-stacked fingers; business men and women in tailored suits; and stylish retirees clinking glasses of champagne, splitting their burger with a knife. This being a new Stephen Starr restaurant, there will be celebrities, too, or at least people you 
 might be celebrities but can’t quite place. The restaurant is more modern, more effortlessly cool than Starr’s best known contributions to the New York restaurant scene, Buddakan and Morimoto. There's a timelessness to the space and the scene. It seems to have always been here (it hasn't, of course, it opened only in May).
There are some misses when it comes to the menu. Steak tartare is delicious. Roasted bone marrow is also delicious, but when it’s scooped out of the bone and plopped onto an otherwise fantastic steak tartare, as it is at Clocktower, it reminds you that its composition is almost entirely fat and that once this kind of fat cools, it becomes firm and grainy and unappealing. In cold chopped steak, the hardening happens quickly. As you are eating it, the texture of the marrow changes. (Even if you never ponder these things while you eat, it might make you wonder, is this what is happening inside my body?) The macaroni and cheese, a pile of slightly overcooked rigatoni layered with bechamel and morels, also has an unnecessary addition of heavy, meaty fat: cubes of ox cheeks. 
Service can be wobbly, and it’s not clear why the servers insist on crowding the tables with more plates than it can hold, instead of sending you things in stages. There’s also an unnecessary amount of table service, which should feel fun but is mostly quite awkward and dated. Why finish the gorgeous peeled tomato salad with burrata with basil granita at the table? Why bring the salmon out on a wooden platter just to transfer it to the plate at the table?
Desserts rarely get the attention they deserve, but Clocktower has a few impressive ones by Sebastien Rouxel, so don’t skip. For those who veer away from sweet stuff after their meal, there’s a little ode to the grapefruit, with segments poached in Campari until they taste rich, caramelized, and pleasingly bitter, with a tiny, bright quenelle of grapefruit sorbet. If you want something more traditional, there’s a glorious tarte tatin for two (or four, really) made with tangy pink lady apples that have been truly, properly caramelized so the outside is slick and the edges are chewy. (The extra caramel sauce on the side is totally unnecessary—if you can catch your server before he pours, ask him to leave it on the side for you to manage on your own.)
Right now, there’s a particularly fantastic strawberry dessert with a tender olive oil shortbread and a thick vanilla-infused custard and a sharp verjus ice cream melting over everything. It’s the most delightful of the desserts for its pure flavors and subtly interesting textures—a blackberry, broken up into tiny frozen beads. It’s also a tasty little reminder from the Clocktower that despite some of its heavier, almost wintery dishes, the restaurant does have an understanding of summertime in New York.
: Two Stars (Very Good)
: Tomato salad with burrata ($15); Dressed crab with crisp uni ($21); Roasted Dover sole with capers and lemon ($54); Dry-aged strip steak ($52); Fish and chips with mushy peas ($21); Burger ($24)
: At the glittering golden bar, packs of bros in various shades of pink and blue shirts. In the dining rooms, groups of women after work in sleeveless white blazers and glittering cocktail rings, date nights, birthday celebrations, and hotel guests on their phones.

=== Title: The Best Pizza in London, Tested by a Choosy Italian Chef - Bloomberg ===

For someone who describes pizza as happy food, chef Francesco Mazzei takes it very seriously.
We're going to try three of London's most fashionable pizzerias, and he's laying down rules with the confidence of Simon Cowell dispatching a weak singer or Nicki Minaj a rival on Twitter.
"I'm looking for an authentic pizza," says Mazzei, a native of Calabria, who wowed diners at 
 in the City of London and is now taking over 
 in Mayfair. "The crust has to be Napoletana for me. Pizza Romana is not real pizza."
"I cannot tell you where my daughter wants to go for pizza because it's Pizza Express. She loves the thin crispy base, which is the Romana. People sometimes save money on the cheese, which is a big mistake. It has to be mozzarella."
It's the second time that he and I have toured London in search of the perfect pizza. 
, in 2008, Franco Manca triumphed in a not particularly strong field. This time around, I've suggested we start at NY Fold,  the first overseas restaurant of Bruno DiFabio, a six-time World Pizza Champion.
Big mistake.
"We should stop mixing New York pizza, Bombay pizza, or stuff like that," Mazzei says. "Pizza is Italian. Let's not forget that. This is the first time I've had New York pizza in London."
DiFabio is on hand to greet us and explains that his bases are light and airy because of his two-part fermentation process. He's right. The pizza is a world away from some of the greasy slices served in New York.
Mazzei agrees the crust is very good and comments on the quality of the ingredients, particularly the mozzarella. Then things go downhill a little. The cheese is evenly spread across the margherita. Mazzei misses fresh tomatoes and herbs.
"It's a good pizza, but not authentic Italian," he says. "I might get a slice and a beer if I were out at night. I'd 10 times rather have this than a kebab." Sorry Bruno: He marks down your New York pizza for being too New York. 
Next we head to 
, which belongs to friends who toured Italy to learn the secret of a perfect pizza. They also visited Franco Manca, the small Brixton restaurant that was ahead of the pack years ago with its great pizzas.
We settle down at an outside table, start drinking a couple of large beers (to follow the ones at NY Fold), and try to ignore the two people who are filming with us for Bloomberg and folks who glance at us as they try to squeeze by onto Dean Street.
Mazzei breaks into a smile as pizza is served.
"It looks authentic," he says. "It's fantastic. It's Napoletana style, and it is light. Now. I am happy. Look at the tomato, look at the mozzarella, look at the basil on top. Oh my god, this is really good. The crust is bubbly and crunchy. The flavor is a happy flavor. It feels like I am in Italy now. This pizza makes my day shiny despite the bad weather. Pizza is a happy food, and when you eat pizza like this with a nice beer, it's Italy. I feel like I am back home now." 
Our final stop is 
. This Covent Garden pizzeria is owned by Mark Wogan, the son of broadcaster Sir Terry, hero of many a Eurovision Song Contest, but I'm not sure if I am supposed to tell you that. 
"It's really good, Mazzei says. "I didn’t think it would be possible to have pizza this good in London. The quality has improved a lot in the past eight years. If England carries on the way they do now, I'm sure they'll get as good as Italy in about five, 10 years.
"The standards are very good, and I find this quite refreshing. Less is more, especially for Italian cooking. Great tomato, a great mozzarella, fantastic basil, the best extra virgin olive oil, and you've got a great pizza. That’s what Italian cooking is all about, and these guys are starting to know that now." 
There are many fine pizza restaurants in London. Here are some others to try.
This is the daddy. Franco Manca was making world-class pizzas in a tiny store in Brixton long before fashion caught up with pizza. I blush when I remember that I thought a microwave must be involved for anywhere with a cooking time of 40 seconds. Franco Manca has since developed into a chain. We tried to test the latest branch in Broadgate Circle, in the City, but the staffers were alarmed when we showed up unannounced with cameras. (I don't blame them.)
 
Rocco Princi is an artisan baker with style, and this Soho venue is usually packed. It's not a pizzeria, but there are fine pizzas from a wood-fired oven. The coffee and cakes are pretty good, too. You could really feel you are in Milan. (Which, on the whole, is a good thing.)
Mazzei's brother Valerio has opened a restaurant next to the Tate Modern, in Southwark. I went along with Mazzei, and the pizzas were better than most. But I couldn’t think of any way of including them that didn't sound nepotistic. So, at all costs, avoid this joint at 20 Sumner Street, SE1 9JZ. (But if you do go, please mention my name, and I shall hope for commission.)
 
This Italian restaurant in Clerkenwell is a destination for some pizza lovers. The margherita is authentic and delicious, with a particularly good crust and quality ingredients. To me, it fell just short of Pizza Pilgrims and Homeslice, my favorites. 
I go to this Shoreditch offshoot of Soho House more for the buzz than the pizzas. They are baked in a wood-fired oven in an old tea warehouse with high ceilings and industrial chic. The staff and customers are probably hotter than the pizzas, but who cares? (Well, Mazzei does, but I didn't bring him here.)

=== Title: Noma Is Moving to Sydney Next Year - Bloomberg ===

Over the weekend, Danish chef Rene Redzepi of Noma posted a 
 to the restaurant’s website: He and his team of more than 40 cooks, servers, and dishwashers will be setting up their restaurant in Barangaroo, a suburb of Sydney, for 10 weeks beginning in January 2016. 
Earlier this year, Redzepi experimented with the long-term pop-up structure in Tokyo, where he ran Noma on the 37th floor of the Mandarin Oriental for five weeks. 
, beginning with an unforgettable wriggling shrimp covered in ants from the Nagano forest, and the wait list for dinner was reportedly 60,000 names long.
British chef Heston Blumenthal 
 earlier this year, too. His approach at Melbourne’s Crown Towers was to faithfully re-create his Fat Duck menu, from the jelly of quail right down to the aerated beetroot.
In a 
, Redzepi describes his first experiences in Australia, and explains how the temporary move is a chance for him and his team to learn about the landscape by experimenting with local ingredients. Just like in Tokyo, cooks will be scouring for tasty things that live and grow there—Redzepi’s Instagram feed has already been a tease of 
, fat 
, and 
. 
He writes: “From the tropical fruit in the north, to the native pepper leaf of Tasmania; the pristine fish and shellfish of the very south, and all the new exotic wonders in between. Our research forays will take us into the bush, around every shoreline, weeding our way through Flinders and Kangaroo Island. Somewhere along that course I may even get my first surfing lesson.”
Dinner for two at Noma Tokyo cost about $1,350, and it's not clear whether Sydney tickets (which are not yet on sale) will be comparable. Meanwhile, you can sign up for more information

=== Title: Pitti Uomo: Nine Take-Home Style Lessons From the Year's Best-Dressed Event - Bloomberg ===

Europe's Month of Men's Fashion is upon us.
With 
 and London Collections (and all its
) behind us, our style director Nic Screws is about to embark the third leg of her fashion industry world tour, Milan Fashion Week (
).
What is Pitti, you ask? Ostensibly it's the world's most important menswear tradeshow where fashionable gentleman from the four corners of the world gather in Florence, Italy, to talk shop with designers, buyers, and press over a scoop (or ten) of gelato.
In practicality, it's also one big
 on how to dress. And
. And show the world
.
Before we head north, here are nine style tips worth noting this year—and you can start incorporating into your own looks right now.
The distinct pattern of a windowpane fabric is a strong option to spice up your summer suiting. To stand out even more from the crowd (and in this rig, that really is the point), don’t wear a simple navy, black, khaki, or gray, but choose a contrasting pattern like white on navy. 
 
 took his razor-sharp suit and dressed it down casually by slipping on a pair of white Stan Smiths sneakers. Looking good while being comfortable is always a win-win.
Adding a little pattern, like this plaid double-breasted vest to a traditional navy-and-white combo is a surefire way to amplify an outfit—especially if you’re not ready to commit to full plaid suit. A solid blazer on top helps mute the plaid's busyness, giving you time to adjust (and we'd wager, fall in love). 
Get a bike already. You're broadcasting your stamina 
 helping the environment, and what on-looker doesn't like that? 
 
Here's not one, but three ways to wear a well-fitted double-breasted blue suit. Read that again: 
. The trick here is keeping your shirt white and your tie color a sort of faded neutral. And don't forget to smile.
Most people associate seersucker with the traditional white and blue striped suit. But most people aren't as stylish as you. Opt instead for an unexpected color of seersucker, like crimson red, that will definitely capture attention while still keeping you cool.
When the rest of your outfit is bold, simple accessories can make or break an outfit. In this case, retro-reflective mirrored shades are working for this stylish fellow. Don't be afraid to try a couple things on. Look for things that initially pop, then fade into the background of your overall look.
This is the perfect example of how to pull of an ivory white suit—by adding a punch of color via your shirt and tie. @FlippoFiora opted for a French bengal striped shirt and solid knit tie. It's Italian dandy, done right.
 
This one is tricky, as you don't want to look like an extra from 
during your day party in The Hamptons, but if you're feeling funky, embrace the hat. It can provide just the right Italo Dandy X-factor to set you apart. Just be honest with yourself: if it takes your entire outfit over the top, take it off. (You'll know.)    

=== Title: Untitled Review: The Whitney's New Restaurant Does Museum Food Right - Bloomberg ===

Every restaurant should aim to be pleasant and accommodating—that’s sort of the point. But just like people, some restaurants have a tendency to take it too far, becoming agonizingly agreeable, void of personality and quirk, pleasant to the point of self-effacement. In an attempt to charm everyone, these menus will include a year-round steak, an over-accessorized burger, a relatively innocuous pasta dish, and 
, just like that, a restaurant can disappear into a chatter of identical new places.  
, a new Union Square Hospitality Group restaurant inside the 
, could easily have gone this way. The building that houses the restaurant on the edge of Manhattan’s Meatpacking District is a gleaming tourist magnet that opened in May, a 200,000-square-foot asymmetrical stack of soaring gallery spaces and terraces looking over the Hudson river. The glass-encased dining room resembles a diner from the future, huge and modern, with beautifully colored cakes set up under domes along the counter, as if a pastry chef has brought a 
 from upstairs to life.
How refreshing then, that Untitled doesn't pander. The kitchen has a clear focus on excellent vegetables and local seafood: fat, perfectly cooked mussels bobbing around with fava beans in a salty green broth, fried oysters on a sweet, summery corn-and-bean relish with a generous dollop of mayonnaise, all so tasty you’ll need to clean the bowl out with a piece of warm bread. There are cucumbers in sesame-spiked broth over cold buckwheat noodles, and toast points piled with lobster meat that’s been brightened with preserved lemon and fresh anise-y tarragon leaves.
This cooking pleases—but delicately, in unexpected ways.
For now, there is no rib-eye on the menu, no cheeseburger. (The menu, naturally printed in Swiss typeface Neue Haas Grotesk,
puts an emphasis on white space and is carefully edited to be just about 16 lines.) The food is light and bright, satisfying without getting heavy or particularly meaty, which is exactly how you want to eat when it’s so hot outside that even your sunglasses are making you sweat.
Though a few destination restaurants inside museums exist—including the 
 in the Museum of Modern Art and M. Wells Dinette, set up in an old classroom at PS1 in Queens—museum dining is not usually any good, nor does it generally have a point of view beyond speed, efficiency, revenue. Untitled has what most museum restaurants don't: Michael Anthony, chef at Gramercy Tavern, where he's been cooking consistently delicious food for years and with which he splits his time.
He brought along Chef de Cuisine Suzanne Cupps, who has worked with him for the last four years. Together, they change the menu at Untitled frequently, spontaneously tweaking dishes. This means the swordfish with eggplant you had on Monday might be swapped out for yellowfin tuna from off the coast of Long Island later in the week, served under a layer of basil seeds hydrated so they're encased with jelly. (These are more cool texture than flavor.)
One of the best dishes on the menu right now is a warm salad of slightly charred pole beans under hazelnuts and a little calamari. There’s a pool of deep red, smoky sauce made from dried guajillo peppers that makes every element on the plate somehow taste a bit more intense, more like itself. Sure, you'll find a crowd-pleaser of fried chicken, too, but even this is a bit unexpected: a mix of fried and roasted meat, served on a bed of creamy, wilted greens with some bitter radicchio leaves that make the sweeter, fattier pieces of meat that much more interesting.
The most impressive dessert, and perhaps the most delicious, is Miro Uskokovic’s tall blueberry cake, stacked
with thick layers of creamy frosting, and crunchy, slightly smoky pieces of sesame-peanut nougat. It’s covered with a positively sour blueberry sauce at the table. The cake itself has a wonderfully light, tender crumb, and if it’s been a while since you had a truly spectacular slice of cake—if you’ve forgotten just how charming a big slice can be—order it.
If you’re after a stunning view of the city, there's a casual, 
 café on higher ground (entry requires a ticket to the Whitney) that shares the same team and offers a faster menu of salads, soups, and loaded toasts. Don’t underestimate the views available downstairs at Untitled, which offers seats in the busy, open-air plaza by the High Line. Though the service out here can be less steady and attentive than it is inside, it's warm and friendly in the manner you'd expect from a Danny Meyer joint. And there's way better people-watching: locals unable to resist photographing the new façade; people pacing the street, yelling obscene things into their phones; European tourists making out a little sloppily on the stairs before stopping to buy a popsicle from one of the carts parked on the sidewalk, and then taking carefully orchestrated selfies. It’s not just dinner, it's a front-row seat to midsummer Manhattan.
: One Star (Good)
: Roasted and fried chicken salad ($24); Tuna with basil seed vinaigrette ($25); Smashed cucumbers with soba ($12); Pole beans with calamari and hazelnuts ($14); Marinated mussels ($14); Strawberry-ricotta pound cake ($14); Peanut butter-blueberry crunch cake ($14)
: Shoppers with their bags; French tourists at the end of a walking-intensive afternoon; downtown socialites meeting for cocktails; amblers down from the High Line
: To access the more casual café upstairs, you’ll need a ticket to the Whitney. The restaurant Untitled does not require this.
 

=== Title: Hublot Goes Clear With the Big Bang Unico Sapphire Watch - Bloomberg ===

Hublot's got a new watch. And instead of being 
 or solid gold, it's completely see-through.
The 
 is all about showing off what Hublot can do with sapphire. The 45 mm multipart case, bezel, and (of course) crystal are all sapphire and blend seamlessly together. It almost looks as if there's no crystal over the dial because the rest of the case is already sapphire. The only components that aren't sapphire are the combination titanium-and-sapphire crown and pushers, the titanium screws, the strap-release system, and the translucent silicone strap itself. It's much lighter weight than you'd expect and is still waterproof to 100 meters.
One advantage to using sapphire as the case is you can see the movement inside from every angle. Here, that means a great look at Hublot's in-house Unico chronograph movement, which is a flyback chronograph with a column wheel and a double clutch. To make all this even easier to see, Hublot has treated the movement with a black PVD finish. The watch has a 72-hour power reserve and is automatically wound by the rotor on the backside of the movement.
Sapphire watches don't come cheap. Milling the hard material into the shape of a watch case is a laborious process with a high rate of breakage, meaning that for every good case you get, you have to throw a lot of cracked and shattered components away. Richard Mille is the brand best known for selling sapphire-cased watches, 
. Even if you compare the Big Bang Unico Sapphire to some of Hublot's other sapphire watches, it looks like tremendous value. Take the LaFerrari Sapphire, for example, which carries a whopping $575,000 price tag (and is a lot less wearable, to boot).
Importantly, though, this watch isn't coming onto the scene in isolation. Just a few weeks ago, TAG Heuer, also owned by Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) and managed by Jean-Claude Biver, 
. At $15,950, this is the least-expensive Swiss-made tourbillon chronograph on the market, coming in at a small fraction of the price of most competitors. It looks as though, after 
, LVMH has decided that one way to get customers interested again is to give them watches that were formerly out of their budgets at prices they can actually afford. These aren't bargain bin prices, but they do offer good ways for collectors to move from that first watch or two to more serious collectable pieces. 
The 
 is a limited edition of 500 pieces and is priced at $57,900.

=== Title: Natural Wine’s Growing Popularity Stokes Industry Tensions - Bloomberg ===

At his small winery in the foothills west of Madrid, Fabio Bartolomei points out a few things the giants in the industry don’t like to advertise: Their wines are made from grapes sprayed with pesticides and are tweaked with colorants, thickeners, and flavor enhancers. The founder of Vinos Ambiz takes the opposite approach, producing 8,000 to 12,000 bottles a year of tempranillo, albillo, garnacha, and a handful of other varieties with minimal intervention. Bartolomei and hundreds of other producers of so-called natural wines are now unnerving (or at least annoying) the big commercial players of the industry as restaurateurs, distributors, oenophiles, and an increasing number of ordinary drinkers seek authenticity in their wines.
The Establishment generally “views natural winemakers as weirdos,” says Bartolomei, who lists what he does and doesn’t do to his wines on the labels—though he doesn’t have to. (Neither Europe nor the U.S. requires wine producers to list ingredients other than sulfites.) But the movement he belongs to, which began in France in the 1970s, has gained global momentum, with at least a dozen major expos held yearly from London to Tokyo. “Natural wine was considered hippie juice 15 years ago,” says John Wurdeman, the American co-founder of Pheasant’s Tears, a natural winery located in the former Soviet republic of Georgia that exports 70 percent of its annual output of about 60,000 bottles. The market is “growing at incredible speed,” he says, with world-famous restaurants such as Noma in Copenhagen and El Celler de Can Roca in Girona, Spain, each stocking hundreds of labels. Jenny Lefcourt, co-founder of natural wine distributor Jenny & François in New York, says her company’s sales have doubled since 2009: “It’s not just Paris and New York anymore—we’re selling across the U.S.”
A January survey of 1,000 wine drinkers by market-research firm Nielsen showed 65 percent of 21- to 34-year-old respondents were interested in natural wine. Although there are no reliable statistics, experts estimate that natural wine sales amount to less than 1 percent of the total worldwide, which reached nearly $268 billion in 2014, according to Euromonitor International. “A lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon because it’s sexy to make natural wine,” says Isabelle Legeron, the organizer of RAW, an annual natural wine fair in London that draws some 180 vintners and 3,000 visitors. “It’s very similar to the growth of craft beer,” says Legeron, one of 322 people worldwide who’s certified as a Master of Wine. She, Bartolomei, and Wurdeman say demand is running ahead of supply. Prices in the U.S. are similar to conventional wines, ranging from $9 for a natural red table wine from Frey Vineyards in California to $275 for the sought-after 2012 Vosne-Romanée Les Jachées from French producer Jean-Yves Bizot.
The growing popularity of natural wine has stoked tensions within the larger industry. Many wine producers take issue with the term, which they say disparages those who don’t claim to be natural. Also, anyone can use the designation because there’s no official definition. The concept “pisses people off,” says Spiros Malandrakis, a senior analyst at Euromonitor in London. Michael Kaiser, director of public affairs at WineAmerica, a Washington-based trade group with more than 600 members, including large producers such as Constellation Brands, says “the consumer needs to know [natural wine] doesn’t mean other products are not as good because they’re not labeled as ‘natural.’ ”
Big Wine wants “to belittle” the term natural wine, says Alice Feiring, author of two books on the subject, because it shows how industrialized the winemaking process has become. “They want to destroy it,” she says. “Conventional producers are in a scramble because they don’t want to lose market share.”
France, Italy, and Spain are the world’s largest producers of natural wines, but other countries want to join the club. The Georgian government has invested about $500,000 since it started promoting the country’s natural wine in 2012, according to Irakli Cholobargia, head of marketing at the National Wine Agency in Tbilisi. Demand has been so strong that the country’s 30 or so natural wine producers “are sold out” before the product is bottled, he says.
Vineyards in California also want in. “I joke around that in Europe they have a 2,000-year head start on us,” says Darek Trowbridge, who founded Fulton-based Old World Winery in 1998 after becoming disenchanted with industrial wine production methods while earning his oenology master’s at Fresno State.
Some proponents believe that as consumption of natural wine continues to rise, conventional brands will face growing pressure to list the additives they use on their labels. “If you buy a Snickers bar, you have the right to read what’s in it,” says Wurdeman. “You don’t have that right when you buy a bottle of wine.” WineAmerica’s Kaiser says “the existing labeling requirements are adequate.”
The debate has been healthy for the industry because it shows there’s an alternative way, says Paul Draper, chief executive officer and head winemaker at Ridge Vineyards in Cupertino, Calif. Starting with his 2011 vintage, he redid his labels to include all the additives and processes he uses.
But do the virtues of natural wine guarantee that it tastes good? David Bird, a chemist and Master of Wine whose book, 
, is a standard for teaching conventional winemaking, believes natural is better. Yet he concedes he’s “tasted some very strange ones, which are not really very pleasant.” Says Bird: “You have to know the science behind it and control it.”

=== Title: The Jaeger-LeCoultre Memovox Is the King of Alarm Watches - Bloomberg ===

A mechanical alarm might not seem like the most useful watch complication when your iPhone and Amazon Echo can easily take care of getting you to that morning meeting on time, but to many of us there's something undeniably charming about a buzzing mechanical timepiece. A particularly handsome alarm watch is the Jaeger-LeCoultre Memovox, which took on many shapes and sizes over the years. Here are a few versions to know right now.
Actually, before we get into the watches, it's important to understand how a mechanical alarm works. Basically there's a second spring inside the watch that powers a little hammer that rapidly bangs on a metal gong when the mechanism is triggered. You manually set the time on the dial, wind the alarm, and then wait for the ring to go off. Some watches are quiet, but most are more than loud enough (and often abrasive enough) to wake you up.
The very earliest Jaeger-LeCoultre Memovox watches date back to sometime around 1950 and set the tone for the line that would develop all the way up to today. At the core is the central dial disk, manipulated with the second crown on the right side of the case. By turning this disc, you wind and set the alarm. It's a 12-hour schedule (so you're not sleeping 14 hours, sorry) and you simply line up the arrow with when you want to wake up. It's an approximation, but you can get within about 10-15 minutes pretty easily.
The early Memovox had slim cases that ranged in size, but by the 1960s Jaeger-LeCoultre had settled around 37mm, which is what you have in the 
 and 
 here. The size is a nice middle ground that wears well and looks surprisingly modern. These are definitely dressier watches, but JLC didn't stick to that formula forever.
The most collectable Memovox, I'd say, is the Polaris. In the early 1960s Jaeger-LeCoultre made less than 2,000 of this hybrid alarm and dive watch and they've become extremely collectable. You can see from the two examples here, 
 and
, that some of the smaller details on the dial and case changed, but the basics remain the same. The three crowns (all marked with hashes on the outside for added grip) adjust the alarm function, the hands, and the inner bezel, and the case has a double-caseback system with one sealed for underwater action and an outer one with perforations to let the sound out.
After the original Polaris, Jaeger-LeCoultre made a few sequels, including the Polaris II. 
 dates from 1970 and looks every bit the decade it's from. The larger barrel-style case is anchored by a link bracelet and has dusty blue accents on the bezel and inner dial sections. The alarm function is the same, but this time the bezel is external and is rotated by hand, hence the missing crown. There are also modern limited edition re-issues of the original Polaris (that are actually well done), but good luck finding one of those still for sale.
Jaeger-LeCoultre isn't the only brand that made popular mechanical alarm watches. The list of others is relatively small when you think about how many manufactures have their own chronographs and calendars, but Vulcain and Tudor both stand out as titans in the field. Tudor has its 
 alarm watch, a more minimal take on the complication that it still makes today. Until last year's 
 watch with an in-house movement, the alarm module in the Advisor was Tudor's only in-house mechanism. 
 alarms have been worn by presidents and other famous figures and have been the centerpiece of the brand's offerings since 1947.

The newer dining room will seat 180 guests at booths, with another 120 in private rooms available in Standard and Executive Class. The latter will have their own bar areas and private-jet style seating.
The modern British grill, with the working name of Bob Bob Exchange, or BBX, is scheduled to open in April next year in the wedge-shaped building, known as the Cheesegrater, which at 225 meters (738 feet) is the tallest in the City of London. The restaurant will occupy the entire third level.
"We want to create a destination restaurant for an eclectic crowd that represents London as a whole, not just the Square Mile," said Leonid Shutov, who created Bob Bob Ricard in 2008. "In Soho, we get everyone from big-hitting CEOs to the media crowd and theater people through to visitors to London. That's what we will be looking for at BBX. People in the City don't just want a corporate crowd."
A nine-seater restaurant-within-a-restaurant will be an opulent Japanese room where sushi, sashimi and tempura will be served. The total seating of more than 300 guests compares with 200 at Bob Bob Ricard.
The Champagne buttons will be used at the new restaurant. A display will also show bids for an auction, every 30 minutes, at which diners compete to buy fine wines starting at cost, Shutov said.
Bob Bob Ricard is known for some of the lowest wine prices in London, even featuring some of the charges of rival restaurants on the wine list. At BBX, Shutov said he plans to serve house Champagne from methuselahs (6 liters) at about £14 a glass ($19.50).
Wine and food prices in general will be similar to those at Bob Bob Ricard, where most mains cost between £16 and £30.
The menu will center on seasonal meat, fish and vegetables cooked over an open flame or smoked in-house. The look will be modern urban, but warm and luxurious rather than cold and austere, Shutov said.

=== Title: When Two Respected Maitre D's Start Their Own Restaurant - Bloomberg ===

Two of London's leading restaurant managers plan to open their own establishment in Covent Garden — and they're hoping for some of the limelight that usually falls on chefs.
Margot will seat 102 diners over two floors on the site that was home to Moti Mahal on Great Queen Street. While the Italian menu is being created by head chef Maurizio Morelli, formerly of 
, the service may be as distinctive as the food.
The partners are Nicolas Jaouën, a Frenchman from the Loire Valley, who was general manager at 
and helped open 
 and Sao Paulo-born Paulo de Tarso, the face of 
in London as maître d' from its opening in 2010.
"To think of Paulo just as a great maitre d' is to miss the larger point," says New York restaurateur Danny Meyer, the driving force behind Gramercy Tavern and Shake Shack. "He is a boundless force of nature, oozing hospitality from every pore."
De Tarso and Jaouën will need those skills if they are to fill Margot. Covent Garden is awash with tourist chains offering a £7.95 ($10.36) pizza with a £4.45 glass of wine, instead of a restaurant serving more sophisticated dishes using carefully sourced ingredients.
"There's a place for us," De Tarso says. "There's not a lot going on in terms of good food in Covent Garden, and value for money is very important to us. Everything is going to be available in small and large plates, so you can just drop in for a glass of wine and a dish of pasta. 
"Food can be like a commodity and the guys front of house deserve a little bit more respect. Yes, people are there for the food but how you are greeted, how you are seated, how your order is taken and how you are served is all down to us."
He contrasts the high standards of service in New York with the less-engaged style of some waiters in London. 
"You can go to Brooklyn, you can go to Queens, you can go to a mom-and-pop place and you can be extremely well looked after," he says. "New Yorkers understand how important it is the customer coming through the door."
Daniel Boulud, who owns eight establishments in New York, as well as restaurants around the U.S. and in Canada, Singapore and the U.K., says De Tarso can make it work.
"Paulo exemplifies the art of  customer service," Boulud says. "We all could write a book about Paulo. We love him."

=== Title: This Man Spent $3 Million to Make Instant Jello Shots - Bloomberg ===

To 
, the four hours it takes to make Jello shots is an eternity—and an opportunity.
Bars love selling the jiggly, alcohol-infused confections because they’re money makers. But no bartender or sous-chef likes boiling water, mixing the powder, adding the booze, and then…waiting. And making more at midnight after you sell out isn’t an option, so you end up leaving money in partiers’ pockets.
Jetton, a serial entrepreneur who’s started and sold two companies, says he and co-founder 
, a former bar owner, have the answer: a high-tech machine the size of a large microwave that turns out a tray of 20 shots in just 10 minutes. It’s taken them three years, and $3 million of the $4.2 million in venture capital they’ve raised, to turn slow-setting gelatin into fast food, but they’re just about ready for launch. They aim to ship the first commercial machine in March. 
“There was no innovation around gelatin,” Jetton, 49, says in an interview at his office just south of Portland, Oregon. On the other side of a glass wall, one of his eight employees fiddles with tubes, wires, clear plastic containers, and batteries, simplifying the prototype machine for production. “We started with a yellow pad of paper,” he says.
Jetton and Williams say their machine, called the “
,” will do for gelatin what Keurig did for coffee, and make them a fortune in the process. Keurig, now called 
, became the envy of the food-and-beverage business in about 2009 when sales of its single-serving brewing system took off.
The company sells coffee makers yet makes most of its money on the little plastic K-Cups, which caffeine fiends pop into the brewers by the billion each year. In the fiscal year that ended in September, it sold 9.8 billion K-Cups, reaping $3.6 billion in revenue, up 13 percent from the previous year.
Like Keurig, Jetton’s company, Food + Beverage Innovations, plans to make money on gelatin flavor “pods,” not the machines. A pod, enough to make 20 shots, is about the size of a single-serving yogurt. Just drop one in the machine, add water and booze, and hit a button. Ten minutes later, you have a tray of chilly gelatin shots.
Jetton plans to make his Jello shots without Jell-O brand gelatin. (The term “Jello shot” refers to spiked gelatin, regardless of who makes the raw material.) Jetton is sourcing his gelatin through 
, which is better known for its Otter Pops than its also-ran Royal Gelatin. The company is making Jevo’s powdered mix in 17 flavors, from mixed berry to Margarita. 
Kraft Heinz, maker of Jell-O, isn’t a fan. Spokesman Michael Mullen says “Jevo” is an infringement. “Kraft Heinz are [sic] not associated with this company and they are using our trademark without our consent,” Mullen said in an email.
Jetton is undaunted. “If they have an issue with us they can call or send us a letter,” he says. 
Jetton says 2,500 bars, restaurants, casinos, and cruise ships are considering a Jevo machine. He's also working with spirits giant Beam Suntory Inc. on promotions. 
, a company with 17 restaurants in California and Nevada, is signed up to be one of Jetton’s first customers. Terry Hermeling, owner of 
 in Portland, is in line, too. “We sell a lot [of Jello shots], but we have to make them by hand,” he says. “I think he’s onto something. I’m a beer drinker, but the kids like them.”
Eric Bowler, owner of two Portland bars, says he’d like to add Jello shots to his menu. He hasn’t yet, though, because he’d need extra hands as well as another refrigerator. Also: “I hear they disappear,” he says; employees see them in the fridge and say, ‘Oh, Jello shots,’ and take one.
Jetton got interested in Jello shots after Williams, an old friend, came to him with the idea for a machine that would crank them out. Williams owned a Portland club called Bettie Ford—a dark reference to the California rehab clinic. There, and at other bars he owned, Williams sold thousands of Jello shots, he says. Making the things was a pain, though.
Jetton pondered the idea. A college dropout and former U.S. Marine, he made his first fortune in the late 1990s by building the largest network of independent ATMs in the U.S., with 9,000 high-fee machines in bars, restaurants, and casinos. In 2000, he sold it to E*Trade Financial for $100 million. Then he developed a system that speeds payment at the end of charity auctions, and sold that, too, five years ago.
He has big dreams for the Jevo machine. After rolling out in bars, Jetton wants to put them in every hospital and assisted-living center in the world. Gelatin is just as good for delivering medicine to hospital patients as it is for getting Ketel One vodka down people’s throats on Friday nights, he says. And demand could be huge because the sick and elderly often have trouble swallowing pills, but they love their Jello.
In January, Jetton completed a pilot project with 
, providing gelatin cups packed with protein to dialysis patients. They tested the system for ease of use and taste, which is a challenge because protein supplements can taste terrible. A big pharmaceutical company is interested, too. Jetton says he can’t disclose the name yet.
Food industry analyst Phil Lempert says he’s skeptical of the Jevo. “I’m intrigued by the idea,” he says. “But to deliver medicine and to deliver hipster drinks, Jello might be the wrong carrier.” Gelatin is “artificial everything,” he says; hipsters and sick people alike might be put off by that.
And replicating Keurig is tough. 
, an Israel-based company that makes home soda makers, fizzed for a while. Then the stock faltered in late 2013 when sales fell short of too-rosy forecasts. Impending competition has weighed on the shares, too. This fall, Keurig is rolling out a competing drink maker, called “Keurig Kold.” 
Gummy vitamins may be a better precedent, according to Jetton. Avid Health, based just north of Portland, in Vancouver, Washington, figured out how to infuse gummy bears with vitamins; in 2012, 
, maker of Trojan condoms and Nair hair remover, 
 for $650 million.
Other entrepreneurs are chasing gelatin gold in more traditional ways. In October, Los Angeles-based 
 started selling pre-packaged “Jelly Shots.” The five flavors, which include Fresh Lime Margarita, Planter’s Punch, and Meyer Lemon Drop, are all natural, and upscale. They sell for $9.99 to $12.49 for a package of five. No refrigeration is necessary. They’re formulated to be jiggly at room temperature. 
Until Ludlows, no one had re-invented the Jello shot, says co-founder 
.  A rival called 
, makes ready-to-eat shots look like neon apple sauce packs compared with the pastel tones of Ludlows’s.
The first person to ever do a gelatin shot, loosely defined, may have been Antonin Careme, the Frenchman who baked Napoleon's wedding cake. According to Ian Kelly’s 
, Carame, a devotee of complex cuisine, devised a recipe called “Orange-Flower and Pink Champagne Jelly” that called for isinglass, a collagen extracted from the dried swim bladders of beluga sturgeon. Much later, according to Jetton, soldiers used innocent looking Jello shots to get contraband booze onto base.
Estreller’s Jelly Shots are proving especially popular with women. “Moms are obsessed,” she says. “They sneak them in their purses everywhere. They take them to soccer games.” One Facebook post showed a mom nibbling one at Chuck E. Cheese's.  
Estreller says she likes Jevo’s shots. She tasted them at the Nightclub & Bar Show in Las Vegas in March. “They’re sweeter than mine,” she says. “They have a really good texture.”
After three years and $3 million of R&D, they’d better.

=== Title: Zelman Meats Offers New London Start After Fish Restaurant Flop - Bloomberg ===

You're great cooking meat, and you've created some of London's most successful restaurant brands, including one that has hopped the Atlantic to New York. You've come up with a great new idea – fresh fish at modest prices. What could go wrong?
A lot, it turns out in retrospect.
Rex & Mariano looked like a winner. Diners used iPads to order, saving money on a squad of waiters. Reviews were positive, prices reasonable (oysters were sold at a little over retail) and the service charge was a measly 5 percent. 
But for its owners, Rex & Mariano served up a turkey. Average spend was about £30 ($43), says David Strauss, operations director with 
., whose steakhouses are among the finest in London. Rent and rates were "probably over £400,000 a year."
The team got "booted" in the backside, he says. The company lost £800,000, plus building costs, he says.
Rex & Mariano closed after a year. Strauss and his team themselves cleared out the site, and in its place created 
, a steakhouse priced below Goodman but still one where a 400-gram chateaubriand costs £36. It has a mission statement:
Rex & Mariano was a tough lesson for Goodman, whose founder and hands-on owner Mikhail (Misha) Zelman also came up the idea for 
, a wildly successful chain that has now opened at Flatiron in New York, with an outlet in Dubai still to come.
"The good thing about Misha is that he's not afraid of failure," Strauss says. "If you come up with a great idea like Burger & Lobster, you're obviously going to come up with another idea, and we really loved Rex & Mariano. But seafood is difficult. It wasn’t working for us. Meat is much more forgiving.
"We had to open a seafood restaurant to realize what we're good at: Cooking chips and cooking meat.”
Zelman serves cuts such as short ribs and picanha – beef rump that is popular in Brazil but little-known in the U.K. – at £6 per 100 grams, with triple-cooked chips at £4.50. The average bill is lower than at Goodman, where checks average in the range of £45 to £65.
So what kind of spending were they looking for at Zelman, where the art is in-your-face, the music is loud, and the menu isn't afraid of 
 to describe the rock oysters?
“We weren't thinking like that,” Strauss says of price points. “We just wanted to stop the losses. When you lose as much as we lost, you give up caring a bit about concepts and design. We still use the plates from Rex & Mariano. It would just be stupid to throw away plates because they've got the wrong name on them.
"We thought we were going to do like sandwiches and stuff at lunchtime. It hasn’t turned out that way. We didn’t think we'd have any corporate diners but we have, though it’s a much younger crowd than Goodman.
Strauss knows his meat. He was born in Flushing, New York, and learned the ropes at 
, in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan. 
So how do New York and London compare for steak restaurants, for someone who has worked in both? (Goodman's London rival, Hawksmoor, recently announced plans to 
, but Strauss says Goodman has no current plans to follow suit.)
“The Americans are less concerned about provenance: They always have been,” Strauss says. “They want to buy the best that is available. They don’t really care how it got that way.
“And you traditionally get an older, male waiter, especially in New York and Chicago, which you can't find over here. When Misha opened Goodman he was like, ‘Can you get me some big old boys?’ And I got him some small Italian girls, Spanish girls, which he learned to love and the customers love.”
When it comes to the food, there's little difference.
“The customers aren't really that different in steak houses. It's all testosterone-driven.”

=== Title: London's Best Desserts: From Heston Blumenthal to Hawksmoor - Bloomberg ===

Desserts are the forbidden fruits of restaurants, the sinful temptations that turn thin dreams into fat pleasures, good intentions into earthly delights.
If you are going to fall off the healthy eating wagon, best make it worthwhile. Here are some of London's finest puddings. Restaurants may not be too happy if you show up at the busiest times and just order a dessert. But wander in during the afternoon or past the dinner rush and your welcome may be as warm as a jam roly-poly. 
Here's the deal: You choose from six ice creams and sorbets, eight toppings and six sauces, to create your own sundae. It's £7.25 ($10) for two scoops and £8.75 for three. (I wonder why anyone would order two.) It sounds simple enough but you might find yourself wanting everything. It's served in a retro glass and is fabulous.
Chef Jason Atherton's modern take on this traditional English dessert features a smooth cylinder of meringue. Below lurk a miso sweet-pastry disc topped with a fromage frais and blackcurrant mousse, fresh blackcurrants, clove gel and blackcurrant sorbet. Smash your way through the meringue and create your own mess.
This sweet-and-salty combination reflects St. John ethos of simplicity in conception and presentation. The puff pastry with currants from the restaurant's bakery isn't too sweet, while the 
cheese it tangy and sharp. Chef Fergus Henderson's mum is from Bolton, so it's local, too. To make this at home 
.
Chef Nuno Mendes recalls his childhood in Portugal, when his grandmother would take him to cafes and order 
 that were so soft and runny, he would eat them with a spoon. The buttery pastry contains a touch of pork fat, and the tarts are cooked at a high temperature so they are almost burnt, with a near-liquid center.
To many, this is the pinnacle of London puddings. The brioche is remarkably light and fluffy in view of the cream and brandy with which it is loaded. It's served with Costa Rican pineapple that has been spit-roasted for three to four hours. The caramelized fruit is sharp and sweet while the brioche is soft and buttery. The combination is like a hot cocktail on your plate.
Pierre Koffmann's pistachio soufflé with pistachio ice cream has been on the chef's menu since 1977, when he opened La Tante Claire, which went  on to win three Michelin stars. Pistachio was Koffmann's favorite childhood flavor and this creation has, over almost 40 years, become London's most revered dessert.
If Homer Simpson lived in London, this is the dessert he would pick. It is loaded with light and dark muscovado sugar, together with salt, dates and butter before you even get near the 
 Cornish clotted cream on the side. It is heavy and rich - possibly to die for. It is the best-selling dessert across the Hawksmoor group, which shifts more than 1,000 a week.
This baba is served with a choice of five rums, from light and aromatic to hot and spicy. A current favorite is 12-year old 
from Venezuela. This is a dry, savarin dough that is then infused with syrup and citrus. Whipping cream with vanilla is served on the side. Alain Ducasse is reducing the sugar content of his dishes but this still tastes luxuriously sweet.
Chef Mark Hix is a champion of British food and this dessert at Damien Hirst's new restaurant is a modern take on a traditional favorite. It is light and luxurious, with eggs, single cream, raisins and vanilla, topped with brioche. Don't tell anyone but this recipe was inspired by the Swiss chef Anton Mosimann, who served it at the 
.
There was a time when this classic French gateau would have held pride of place on many a dessert trolley. These days, it is made to order. Executive Chef John Williams has added touches of his own - a little white chocolate for texture and some diced pear - but you are tasting history, with layers of caramelized puff pastry and vanilla cream.
Each tart is made with seven ripe Amalfi lemons, caster sugar, butter, nine egg yolks and six whole eggs. But not any old eggs. These come from Bologna, where the chickens are fed a diet of corn and carrots that results in deep orange yolks. Chef Theo Randall's lemon is almost like curd, with a fine balance of sweetness and acidity. There's crème fraiche on the side.
This is a light dish of seasonal berries in a jelly with gin and prosecco. This time of year, it contains blackberries but the dessert should really come into its own with strawberries in the summer. It is fresh tasting and not too sweet.
Sweetings is one of London's oldest restaurants and little appears to have changed since it opened in 1889. The puddings are charmingly old-fashioned and the spotted dick belongs to a happy age before we were watching our waistlines. It's made with suet, flour and milk and studded with raisins for quite a tart, strong flavor. It rests happily in a puddle of custard.
This is a second showing for Amalfi lemons, which are so good they insisted on appearing twice. Here, they sparkle in a mousse that is piped onto a quenelle of peppery ice cream atop a teaspoon of lemon butter. There's a mini cornet on top for texture. This is a light and refreshing dessert with just a hint of a fizz.

Chef Francesco Mazzei started in the kitchen as a boy making ice cream in Calabria. The desserts are a highlight at his new restaurant in Mayfair, where the tiramisu has been hailed as the best in London. Mazzei says there's no secret, just great ingredients and simplicity. He serves 30 to 50 a day, and if any are left over, staffers eat them.
 

=== Title: Panerai Looks Meet Rolex Tech in Rare Ref. 6152-1 Military Watch - Bloomberg ===

Italian brand Officine Panerai made watches for the Italian Royal Navy around the start of the 20th century, and the surviving examples of these are very collectible for fans. After about a decade of selling the military the ref. 3646, the navy asked the watch brand for a more heavy-duty version of a diver's wristwatch, and the ref. 6152 and 6152-1 is what Panerai came up with.
This model is often called the "Luminor," after the luminous substance you see on the hands and numerals that Panerai patented in 1949. Luminor replaced "Radiomir," which was the lume that was developed between 1910 and 1915. (The Radiomir nomenclature is still used to mark Panerai watches today.)
There are actually two dial discs here—one coated in Luminor and one black face with cutouts for the numbers and the batons, so the Luminor shows through.
There are only about 100 of these watches known to still be on the market, which makes them especially hot. In 2013 one sold at Christie's Geneva for 
.
The case and movements were made by Rolex, and this example bears a signature by Rolex on both—as well as rare military markings engraved on the back of the case. (Watches supplied to elite warriors like froggers, torpedo riders, and commanders of the Italian navy bore the "Marina Militare" insignia on the dial, as seen here.) A bulky crown protector on the side of the cushion-shaped case is an additional flourish. 
This example is in mint condition and has not been polished down to any noticeable extent. The time-only movement is manual, a Role caliber 618, and in great working condition with 15 jewels. The dial is also in good shape, although you'll notice some lume is missing from the four o'clock baton. 
At 47mm the watch is a little wide for the time, which means it will wear very well today. It is available for sale for 
. 

=== Title: Four Major Watch Trends From Baselworld 2015—Plus One We’re Tired of Hearing About - Bloomberg ===

is now officially over.
There were some 
, both formal and 
, plus some 
 (and even a 
). Watches don't have seasonal cycles as fashion does, but every year 
. They can be as simple as a popular dial color (or two) or as complex as a genuine innovation in technology—no small feat, considering the basics are about 400 years old.
Here's what to look for on wrists in 2015.
The days of choosing among either steel, gold, and platinum are over. Whether it's due to the creativity coming from independent watchmakers or the challenges being posed by 
, watchmakers are working with less-common materials—and even inventing new ones. Bremont has teamed with Boeing to bring proprietary titanium alloys to your wrist, while Rado introduced a new kind of lightweight ceramic poached from Formula 1 (Si3N4, for the nerds out there). New materials also means new finishes, so your watch can look like the performance machine it is.
It's something of a running joke among those of us who scribble about watches for a living that every spring, you can count on glossy fashion magazines to run some cheesy headline about how blue watches are the next big thing. So to keep myself above reproach, I'm throwing brown into the mix. Nearly every major brand, from Bulgari to Rolex, seemed to unveil some blue-dialed creation, while a handful of smaller brands, including Grand Seiko and Vulcain, showed sophisticated brown models. Blue is easy, brown is hard, and there are an abundance of good options out there, whichever way you want to go.
The Swiss mechanical watch industry got pummeled in the 1970s and '80s, when quartz watches from Asia became affordable and widely available. The coming wave of smartwatches could very well hit the industry with a fresh set of challenges—only this time, traditional watchmakers don't want to get caught sleeping. Makers such as Frederique Constant are launching 
, while Bulgari announced a concept watch that acts as a digital key to encrypted data. The big news, of course, was 
, though it will be a few months before we see a full-fledged Android Wear watch emerge from Switzerland.
Brands such as Tudor and Longines have been wooing collectors with modern replicas of vintage classics for the better part of a decade. This year we're seeing a different flavor of nostalgia take hold: Instead of taking designs right out of the archive, brands are creating genuinely new watches that adhere to a pared-down aesthetic that was popular 50 years ago. Zenith's El Primero Chronograph Classic might be the best example of this, but Vulcain's new guilloché dial Cricket and TAG Heuer's Carrera Caliber 6 hit the mark as well. Slim cases, subtle colors schemes, and beautiful, open dials are hallmarks to watch.
Come on already, stop talking about rose gold. We get it: Gold comes in colors other than yellow and white. Whether you call it rose, red, pink, or blush, it's the same stuff, and watch brands can stop patting themselves on the back for finally offering the option for most of their watches. The entirely rose gold Nautilus from Patek Philippe might be one of the 
, but that's largely because it's exactly what collectors have been seeking for years. No one talks about how big diamonds are this year or how hot cashmere is going to be in the fall, and it's time we treated this richly tinted gold the same way. 

=== Title: Rolex vs. Tudor: A Tale of Two Vintage Day Dates - Bloomberg ===

With vintage watches, it's the little details that matter: Two may look nearly identical from across a room, but a few key differences visible up close can make one of them far rarer—and perhaps an incredible value—for the astute collector. This Rolex Day-Date and Tudor Date+Day are textbook examples.
In 1956, Rolex started selling the Day-Date, the very first watch to show the day of the week fully spelled out on the dial. It was essentially a souped-up version of the Datejust, available only in precious metals. (Originally just in 18 karat yellow gold and platinum, then expanding to include pink and white gold.) Only a handful were ever made in stainless steel, and these are about as collectable as Rolex watches can get. 
A few years later, in the 1960s, Rolex's more affordable sister brand Tudor added the Date+Day to its line-up as the analog to the already famous Day-Date. Significantly, this watch was available only in stainless steel and two-tone gold-and-steel models, clearly differentiating it from the all-gold Rolexes. Various Date+Date styles were made over the years, with different case sizes, different bracelets, and different dial and bezel combinations, while the Rolex Day-Date has remained the more conservative model. In today's vintage market, you can expect to pay at least three times or four times as much for a Rolex Day-Date in solid gold as you will shell out for a steel Date+Day.
This is precisely why these two vintage finds, fraternal twins of sorts, are so exciting to compare, side-by-side.
Finding Rolex Day-Dates such as the one pictured above, in white gold instead of the more common yellow, is always special. The case on the Rolex dress watches is much more lithe than the sturdy beveled design found on such vintage sport watches as the Submariner and GMT. While the normal clasp here isn't usually deemed as desirable as the President bracelet with hidden clasp, it can work to make the watch feel less formal, especially in a white metal. The slightly yellow tone of the silver dial perfectly matches the color of the gold,giving the watch an all-over monochromatic look.
The best part is that at $9,900, the watch presents incredible value: An understated solid-gold Rolex in great condition for less than $10,000? Sign me up.
Then, too, there's the above Tudor Date+Day. More commonly made in the "jumbo" 38-millimeter size that looks and wears much more casually, this one above is the same 36mm size as the Rolex Day-Date. (Two millimeters might not sound like much, but it matters.). It also features the engine-turned steel bezel with smaller markings, rather than the fluted gold bezel found on its Rolex sibling and some other Date+Day models. The Tudor-branded, Jubilee-style bracelet, full complement of box and papers, and $2,700 price tag make this a great entry-level collectable watch that you'd want to wear on a daily basis. If a casual observer were to mistake it for a Rolex four times as expensive, we won't set them straight.
It would be tempting to look at these watches side-by-side and, given their similarities, say that the Tudor is obviously the better value. It's not that simple.
Getting the Tudor for a fraction of the price of the Rolex (in this case about 25 percent) is appealing, especially since many of the components were made in the same factories, and the design is so similar. It's a flat-out great watch. Less obviously, being able to get a solid gold Rolex watch for less than $10,000 is one of the best values in all vintage watches (
). Why, exactly? A brand new Rolex Day-Date in solid gold will set you back about $30,000; while it's worth every penny at that price, it's hard to argue with the value you get by buying a nice vintage example.
Ultimately, these two watches prove one of the most important principles of collecting vintage watches: Sometimes, the answer to the question "Which one is better?" is "Both." 

=== Title: Scallop Clouds and Ants on a Shrimp: Dinner at Noma in Tokyo Review - Bloomberg ===

It’s dinnertime in Tokyo, and I’m gulping my champagne because the raw, pristine shrimp in front of me is so recently dead that its brain has yet to telegraph this information to the rest of its body. For now it’s all twitching muscle and whirring antennae.
“Don’t be alarmed when you pick it up,” says René Redzepi. The 37-year-old chef at the top of his game has moved here from Denmark to serve a 15-course menu built from Japanese ingredients. He says other things, too, such as where the shrimp comes from and why it's covered in ants, but I don’t hear any of this because I’m still taking in the fact that it's a shrimp covered in ants. It’s like that moment in a horror movie when they pull away the sheet.
Noma, Redzepi’s internationally famous restaurant in Copenhagen that is widely considered one of the best in the world, has actually been using ants for years now—not to mess with people, but to take advantage of the bugs' natural reserves of formic acid, which can mimic the sourness of citrus. (The fruit trees don’t grow in the surrounding region, so they’re generally off limits to Noma’s kitchen.) In 2012, Redzepi served ants at his pop-up in London, chilling them down so they might wake up slowly and presumably a little disoriented—
—floating through Claridge’s on cabbage leaves. More recently, Redzepi’s cooks have sprawled them over raw beef and used them to season grilled cucumbers like a squirt of lemon.
Citrus happens to be in season in Japan, from giant hassaku oranges and sour kabosus to fresh yuzu, and Noma’s kitchen makes good use of it all. But here, at the very beginning of dinner, the ants are a reminder that you’re in the house of Redzepi—at his Tokyo pop-up in the Mandarin Oriental hotel. After photographing the shrimp, and almost everyone finds it necessary to photograph the shrimp, biting down on it is shockingly good: soft and yielding tail meat, exceptionally bright and sweet, slightly sticky, with some high, sharp, throat-warming stuff going on. It goes from terrifying to beautiful, like the ocean after a storm.
(After dinner, on the Tokyo Metro, I got my notes down in emoji.)
From the luxuriously spare dining room, Tokyo’s skyline glitters. The next three hours zoom by. Around me are well-dressed diners from the city and other parts of Japan, and a joyful, tipsy, grownup birthday celebration occasionally squeals with delight by the window. (Note: Noma is not too cool to send a grinning server out with a candle.) A few diners have traveled farther to be here, from China, the U.S., and Europe—and some are opting for the nonalcoholic juice pairings, nursing their jet lag with sour orange and pine. Although the hotel’s grim lobby is a bit of a ghost town, the glassy, slightly gaudy bar up here on the 37th floor is stunning, full of loungers. Walk on, and you’ll see how the crew has transformed the actual dining room into something sleek and Noma-ish—the tables are bare, the chairs are draped with cuddly animal skins, and a gnarly tree seems to grow right in the wall. There is very little to remind you of the French restaurant that normally occupies this space.
A fine bowl of winter citrus is in pith-free segments, glistening in a puddle of kelp oil—thick and syrupy and ever so faintly skunky—with tiny sansho leaves and berries that tickle with a feathery heat. The fruit is generously seasoned but not obscured. It dapples in like light through a canopy.
Monkfish liver is outstanding, arriving on just enough toast to carry it, in thin, cold curls that melt away in the warmth of your mouth. Long strands of raw cuttlefish dressed in the animal’s own inky guts are presented on a wide slotted tray like Japanese soba noodles, with an ice-cold bath of rose water and pink petals on the side. Dip the cuttlefish into the bath, and the aroma is instantly pretty and delicate. Is the flesh so easily transformed? No. Chew, and you find it's just a spritz of perfume. Those darker, unsettling flavors are still at work underneath. 
Service at Noma is fast and confident, friendly but unobtrusive, and presentations are mostly simple. One of my favorite dishes of the night is a white construction of soft rice and ice cream with abstract rice crisps that change texture as they soak in a pool of tangy wood-sorrel juice, poured tableside. And I found only a couple of dishes to be more good-looking than they were good-tasting, such as the very crunchy root vegetables around a sticky cured egg. Not so with the intensely flavored fruit leather of black garlic, fermented until soft and sweet, then folded like a paper fan. It was stunning to look at, a little slick and greasy, but with a flavor that went on and on. 
When reservations opened for the pop-up last summer, the fact that dinner for two with wine cost about the same as a flight from New York to Tokyo ($1,350) did nothing to hinder interest, and the books filled up almost immediately. For fans and regulars, and the people who travel across the world for dinner every time Redzepi trims his beard, this menu is loaded with references to dishes served in Copenhagen. The fermented mushroom, a chewy chocolate-coated candy, may look familiar. Variations on the shrimp on ice are something of a trademark.
Skeptics often think of Noma, or the brand of fine dining it has inspired, as a kind of culinary con—cooks pulling bitter, bad-tasting weeds from the ground and tricking so many rich people into eating them. But Redzepi, who has now been running Noma for about 15 years, produces deeply intelligent, thoughtful menus that are full of deliciousness. And when there’s a challenge, it rewards in unexpected ways. Take the caramel-colored scallop cloud. No, it’s not particularly photogenic, and the smell is, if we’re being polite, powerfully fishy. It's borderline stinky, like what Gollum might use as an air freshener. But as I eat it, I become obsessed with it: light in texture, heavy with flavor, sticking to the roof of my mouth with the sweet insistence of peanut butter. Dried for two days, then aerated, it reminds me how much technique is quietly at work behind the scenes—not to distract or show off, but to focus and intensify, to get you even closer so you taste the thing more clearly.
To serve a 15-course menu twice a day from Jan. 9 to Feb. 14, Redzepi and his research team traveled all over the country to research local ingredients and meet purveyors, then relocated Noma’s team of more than 60 cooks and servers to live and work at the Mandarin Oriental. It was an exercise in applying a long-honed ethos in an entirely new environment, an experiment. A few of the resulting dishes were obscenely good one week in, and the ones I couldn’t get out of my head respectfully expanded on Japanese technique and tradition, such as exquisite fresh tofu under a snow of pale walnuts and yuzu zest. Alone, it was something—bare and sweet and clean—but at the bottom of the bowl was a thick umami-rich sauce that seemed to heighten and refresh and complicate everything. It was essentially perfect, and at the time I wondered, why didn’t Redzepi start the meal with something easier than that shrimp? Something like this?
When the wild duck arrived, presented first whole with its head lolling, then carved with its head split in half, its brains still in the hollow, I knew why. In places the skin was chewy, in others soft. Some meat was livery and rich with blood, other parts tough, grainy, windpipe-y, kinky with bone and cartilage. Alongside the most conventionally pretty, sought-after parts was an invitation to get to know the whole bird. 
That's because Redzepi doesn’t deal in the sort of squishy, coddling fine dining that sedates you like a massage. Noma wants to delight, and it does, but the kitchen often seems more interested in letting you find your own way to pleasure and in pointing out the places where beautiful and ugly blur. Noma may be on the 37th floor of a hotel in Tokyo for now, but it brings the natural world in so close, you can taste it. You can almost feel it wriggle.

=== Title: Finally, New York Gets the French Restaurant It Deserves - Bloomberg ===

Rebelle, newly opened on the Bowery, has an effortless, new wave, French bistro thing going on that could easily make it blur into all of the other Francophile restaurants currently big on duck a l’orange and 
. Instead, it shines brighter than the lot of them. That’s because the food at 
 is fresh and modern, referring to the Parisian bistro without a hint of blurry eyed nostalgia. And when a restaurant refuses to be sentimental, it can get on with more exciting things.
Take the wildly delicious chicken: a slender compression of dark and white meat with crisp, golden skin. To make it, a whole bird has been deboned and roasted, then poached in tarragon-infused butter. It comes with a few potatoes made tender in rendered chicken fat and drippings, a dab of preserved lemon, and a puddle of sauce running through it all, like a fine chicken liqueur. That's it. The flavors are rich but mellow, and—as with perfect Parisian rotisserie—so cozy it’s not always clear where the meat ends and the potatoes begin.
Rebelle means—yes, obviously—rebel, but there’s nothing hostile about the service or food. Rebelle’s resistance is subtle, against clichés. Although the restaurant is run by Americans, it’s French in a way that sets it apart from more nostalgic French-American joints, such as Keith McNally’s 
, or Major Food Group’s 
. There are no cheesy, Disney-fied gestures at Frenchness, no swirling fonts or gilded mirrors to confirm the outdated image of a Parisian bistro. Instead there is a short list of consistently good food and warm, unobtrusive service in a spare, high-ceilinged dining room.
The lamb tartare, with green chickpeas and capers, is clean and bright, with a soft, almost floral acidity. The sweetbreads, served in big pieces under a glaze of lobster sauce, get across their luxurious texture but don't carry any extra weight. You’ll find leeks vinaigrette: cold sliced leeks with a round, bright mustard sauce and broken-up soft boiled eggs. It’s a bistro standard—but so good here, you'll feel like you're meeting it for the first time. Not because of the smoky garnish, those feathers of char on top. It's because Rebelle’s kitchen is smart and sophisticated, running with energy, rigor, and style.
It might not come as a surprise that the chef, 32-year-old New Yorker Daniel Eddy, previously worked at 
 in Paris, an American-owned bistro in the 1st arrondissement. And Rebelle's owners, Patrick Cappiello and Branden McRill, come from 
, just next door. Cappiello’s style of wine service is unceremonious and unstuffy, easy to enjoy—especially if you aren’t dipping into the four-figure grand crus, and you allow him to lead you toward scrappier, more interesting bottles such as a $44 Gamay from Edmunds St. John in California.
There are a few seats at a wide marble counter overlooking the kitchen, which is set back and slightly lower, so you can look in without quite being in trenches. Things are smooth and professional but, like the rest of the dining room, aggressively casual: When you order something the waiter likes, he’s likely to nod with approval while writing it down and say, “Yeah, good move! Ooh, yeah!” 
Some cooks swear by thermometers and timers, others push their fingertips into a slab of meat to guess at the rareness inside. In a more intimate gesture, the meat cook at Rebelle, his arms striped with scars, pulls a fine steel skewer from a whole pork loin and runs the metal along his lips. A thermometer would give him the temperature of one point in the loin, but the range of heat on the needle tells him more. That is how he knows it needs a little more time in the oven before it rests, before he slices it, before it comes out to the dining room on a jumble of garlic scapes and spring onions with a roll of fried head cheese.
I rarely suggest the cheese course because it often doesn’t show off a kitchen’s skill, but the one at Rebelle really deserves your attention: wide, milk-pale ribbons of raw Comté that dissolve like savory crystals on your tongue. There is an option to get a glass of oxidized white wine from the Jura region of France with this. Unless you have to be somewhere extremely important, you should definitely get it—and take your time.
With cheese this good, you could skip the bread entirely, but give it at least a taste—the chewy sourdough comes from Austin Hall at 
, and he's one of the best bakers in New York. Go for a stroll before getting to the dessert course, and you’ll notice the entrance to the bathrooms, off in a corridor, are decorated with old portraits of food heroes and American Francophiles. (Julia Child is on the ladies room entrance, James Beard on the gents'.)
The Saint Honore dessert is very pretty, but the pastry is a bit tight, tougher than it should be. The apricot is a more exciting option, with a dense ice cream made from an infusion of the crushed-up pits, and diced raw fruit—an apricot-plum hybrid—tart, with a fleece of fuzz. The cherry clafoutis is what you’d get at a great home cook’s dinner party in France, family style, delicious. The custard is tender, pulled from the oven before it considers cracking along the top. The sour Rainier cherries have plumped and softened. At the edges of the pan, all the juice has caramelized. Rebelle's update is almost imperceptible here, but you'll be grateful for it: Against tradition, the cherries baked into the dessert have been pitted.

=== Title: Swiss Currency Shock Reverberates One Year After Cap Abandoned - Bloomberg ===

A year after Switzerland shocked investors by ditching its exchange-rate cap and allowing the franc to strengthen against the euro, the effects of its decision are still reverberating through global currency markets.

=== Title: Richard Mille Made a $105,000 Mechanical Fountain Pen - Bloomberg ===

As you can probably guess from the name, the 
 (SIHH) is all about high-end watchmaking. But this year, Richard Mille decided to think off the wrist a bit. In addition to a few new watches, the brand introduced the RMS05, a mechanical fountain pen that uses watchmaking technology to deploy the nib and comes with a six-figure price tag.
No, you didn’t misread that.
At first glance, the pen just looks like a large carbon-fiber pen with a glass window at the top. In fact, though, the body is made of a dark gray NTPT carbon, a special composite that’s lightweight, strong, and has a distinctive surface pattern reminiscent of Damascus steel. Inside the sapphire container at the top is the movement for controlling the nib. It’s made mostly of titanium and has 12 jewels to keep the rhodium-plated gears moving smoothly. The whole thing is finished by hand to the same specifications as Richard Mille’s watch movements. 
The mechanical system itself is based on that of a minute repeater. You hit the button, and a system of gears and springs slowly transfers energy at a constant rate to send the nib sliding out of the front of the barrel. Instead of giving it an external winding system that would require a small bit of human labor, Richard Mille engineered the winding mechanism into the barrel of the pen itself; putting the cap on sends the nib back into its home, generating enough energy for the next deployment. It’s a deceivingly complex solution to a difficult problem you’ve never thought about.
I didn’t get a chance to write with the pen, but I did give the mechanism a whirl during a short demo. The pen is heavy in the hand, even with the carbon exterior, but it’s weighted nicely and doesn’t feel like it would be uncomfortable to write with if you like larger pens. When you activate the mechanism by pressing the button at the top, the whole thing starts to vibrate softly in the hand. It feels like something important is happening. Once deployed, the nib is beautiful and has two-tone frosting and polishing on it that reminds me of a watch movement’s bridges. Putting the cap back on made me a little nervous, but everything closed up smoothly and without a hitch.
If at this point you’re thinking, “Wait, this sounds completely insane,” we’re on the same page. Yes, the RMS05 is crazy. And yes, there’s no reason why one would need this or why it does its job any better than a nonmechanical fountain pen. But, as the manifestation of a thought experiment about how mechanical watchmaking technology can be applied outside of wristwatches and pocket watches, the pen is interesting and even fun. It’s tough for me to suggest that you actually buy one, but I certainly recommend you find one to see in the metal.
The RMS05 mechanical fountain pen costs $105,000 and is available exclusively at 
. It’s not a limited edition, but it will be produced in small numbers because of technical constraints.

=== Title: Parmigiani Senfine Concept Watch Escapement: How It Works - Bloomberg ===

It's rare that there's a genuine innovation in mechanical watchmaking. Sure, every brand loves to talk about the latest thing they've done, but it's usually more surface level than a true advance in the underlying technology. Parmigiani, though, is showing something entirely new in its Senfine concept watch, which keeps time using a totally new mechanism that allows for a 70-day power reserve. Yes, 70 days. (Most watches run only two or three days at a time before needing to be rewound.)
To understand what makes the Senfine special, you must first understand the basics of what makes a mechanical watch work.
The mechanism that actually ticks out the fractions of seconds is called the escapement, and almost all watches use a style called a "lever escapement." This was invented back around 1755 by a British clockmaker, and since then it's been shrunk down to fit on the wrist. But otherwise nothing has changed. A balance wheel with a spring in the center swings a wide arc (usually around 300 degrees, give or take) causing a little fork to flick back and forth on a gear, letting it slowly advance one tooth at a time. Most watches today advance three or four times per second, getting you the little ticks you hear if you put the watch up to your ear.
Only a handful of watch brands, most notably Omega, don't use this basic mechanism in their watches. Omega uses something called a co-axial escapement, which is meant to improve on the lever escapement by making it more reliable, more accurate, and more durable. It's the same basic principle, just done better.
The new Senfine escapement does away with the lever escapement's mechanics for something much more efficient. There's still a wheel, but it swings only 16 degrees instead of 300—and does so 16 times per second instead of four. The increase in frequency means you get much higher accuracy than with a traditional balance, and the low amplitude conserves power (there's a lot less motion happening overall, meaning less power is used). To make this work, the little fork (usually made of metal and cut rubies) is replaced by silicon blades. The result is a mechanical movement that, according to the company
 is capable of getting that incredible 70-day potential out of the same type of mechanical spring that gives a typical watch 48 to 72 hours of juice.
Now, the decoration on the concept watch here might look high-tech, especially with the faux-circuit board engravings on the left side of the dial. But, rest assured, this is a mechanical watch through and through. It's not like 
, which is a hybrid electromechanical timekeeper, even if the two do have a common spirit of innovation.
Sadly, you can't yet buy a Senfine watch from Parmigiani or anyone else. The mechanism is still in the development phase, and there are a few kinks that need to be worked out—namely, shock resistance and temperature variability—before it can be truly industrialized. But keep your eye on Parmigiani and hopefully you'll be able to strap on one of these interesting timekeepers sometime in the next few years. Given that you've got some time and the early models will likely be expensive and sell quickly, we recommend you start saving up now.

=== Title: The Vintage Watch that Inspired Vacheron Constantin’s Latest Creation - Bloomberg ===

While the 1970s gave us some fashions we'd rather forget, it was a great decade for watches. Vacheron Constantin's great contribution is the rare-as-hen's-tooth ref. 222, a classic time-only watch for which vintage collectors clamor.
To celebrate its 222nd anniversary in 1977, Vacheron Constantin decided to make a watch unlike any other it had created before. The idea was to create a bold sport watch that reflected the fashion of the late '70s, and the ref. 222 is exactly that. Many people wrongly believe that the 222 was designed by Gerald Genta, the famous creator of the 
, Patek Philippe Nautilus, and 
 because the watch has a similar style. But it was a different young designer (obviously inspired by the master) who dreamed up the 222, accounting for its slightly quirkier looks. 
In the spirit of the era's steel luxury sport watches, this 222 has a bold case with broad shoulders and an integrated steel bracelet with large, geometric center links. The dial has clear stick markers, long rectangular hands, and a small date window at 3 o'clock. It's purely functional, about as pared-back as you'll find anywhere. Only 500 of the original models were made in steel, with an additional 120 in two-tone gold and steel and 100 in solid gold.
Turning the watch over, you'd find a solid steel caseback with a bold "222" engraving that looks as if it were lifted from the 
 credits. Underneath that is the Vacheron Constantin caliber 1120, an ultra-thin automatic movement, originally made by Jaeger-LeCoultre, that was also used in the first Royal Oak and first Nautilus. It might not be a true in-house Vacheron movement, but it was the right movement for the job, and it's probably one of the best movements of all time. The combination of slim proportions and robust performance make it perfect for watches such as these.
The basic looks of the 222 have been the foundation for 
 for years. Earlier this month, at 
, Vacheron unveiled the first true tribute to the original, the Overseas Ultra-Thin. Not only does the watch look like an updated version of the 222, with the faceted bezel and integrated bracelet (this time, with the brand's signature maltese cross-shaped links), it contains the very same caliber 1120 movement. This time around, you can admire the beautifully finished innards through the sapphire caseback. A tribute this good is surely going to raise the value of the original pieces over time. 
This Vacheron Constantin Ref. 222 is available from 
 and is priced at $33,900.

=== Title: New Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Tribute Gyrotourbillon Watch Complication - Bloomberg ===

Watch brands take anniversaries seriously. For its 85th anniversary of the iconic rectangular Reverso, 
 has gone even bigger than usual with the Reverso Tribute Gyrotourbillon, a dual-sided watch (hence "reverso") with a unique timekeeping mechanism that rotates on two axes. 
Forewarning: Things are going to get complicated.
From the front of the platinum case, you get a basic 12-hour time dial up top and a massive gyrotourbillon below. The movement is ornately finished, with sunburst guilloché work on the mainplate to draw your eyes to the mechanism. The rectangular case has been slightly modified from past Reverso models to exhibit a little more visual tension with arched lugs and an architectural style, although the signature stripes remain at top and bottom, as does the flipping mechanism—slide the case out to the right to turn it over to see the other side.
The back has a more skeletonized second dial, this time just a thin ring letting you see more of the movement underneath. Around it, though, you'll also find a 24-hour day/night indicator and a small seconds hand powered by the tourbillon. The designers nailed the trick of providing both more information and more space for admiring the mechanics. Bravo.
The movement is the totally in-house Jaeger-LeCoultre Caliber 179, developed specifically for this watch. The tourbillon is a flying tourbillon (meaning it's anchored only on the bottom, giving you a better view), and it's twice as nice with two nested cages that let it spin on two axes at once. The outer case makes one rotation per minute, while the inner cage takes only 12.6 seconds to make a revolution. And, since that obviously isn't enough—85th anniversary, people—the hairspring at the center of the tourbillon is shaped like a hemisphere instead of being flat. That last bit doesn't really provide any measurable timekeeping benefits, but it's incredible to watch.
This is far from the most complicated Reverso (the 
 comes to mind), but it's definitely the most wearable. The last Reverso Gyrotoubrillon measured 55.4 mm x 36 mm x 16 mm, while this watch comes in at a relatively svelte 51.2 mm x 31 mm x 12.4 mm. That's nearing 40 percent less volume, and the combination of the reduced size and the more arched case makes the watch extremely comfortable. Sure, it's far from a subtle watch, but it's a grand complication you might actually want to wear. How refreshing.
The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Tribute Gyrotourbillon is limited to 75 pieces in platinum (which is actually quite a few for a watch of this complication level), priced at 270,000 euros ($302,000).

=== Title: Three Blue Suits For Spring (That Are Not Navy) - Bloomberg ===

There is no debating that blue is a quintessentially dude hue. Whether you are rooting for the Kentucky Wildcats or for Chelsea F.C., chances are that one of your sports teams is blue—and so is the label on that domestic beer you're drinking while you watch the game. More important, it's a safe and conservative color for suiting and shirts: At some point, you've owned a navy blue blazer or suit, right? But I want you to break out of the navy box: There are other blues you can wear! So just in time for Seder or Easter supper this weekend, below I've noted three refreshing alternatives to the plain ol’ navy suit.
In springtime, you'll see a lot of men like to start wearing a khaki- or sand-colored cotton suit, which is something that's easy to style around. But you're brave. Why not try a powder-blue option, like this one by 
 Style tip: This will come across as extra sharp if it makes you appear trim and tailored, even though you're wearing a more relaxed fabric. Try to find one that has two buttons and a notched lapel for that slimmed-up look. 
If you wear a rich cerulean blue suit, men and women will look at you twice; it's a vibrant, yet still-understated choice. I like this crisp, wool crepe suit by British tailor 
. Also, the high-contrast white buttons juice up a typically humdrum solid-colored suit even more. Style tip: Try wearing it with a suede driver shoe or caramel-brown lace-up. 
The soft, natural shoulders and vivid, brilliant blue on this modern-cut, two-button suit by 
 are small nods to classic, Neapolitan tailoring. Style tip: Skip the tie and add a playful-print silk pocket square for a more relaxed, confident look. 

=== Title: El Bulli Chef Albert Adria to Open London Restaurant at Cafe Royal - Bloomberg ===

Albert Adria, who helped his brother Ferran make El Bulli into one of the world's greatest restaurants, is coming to London in February to spread a little culinary magic. 
, at the Cafe Royal, will be the chef's first such project outside Spain. He says he hopes to give diners a flavor of contemporary cooking, not a copy of El Bulli, which topped the 
 a record five times before it 
. But he will draw inspiration from that restaurant, along with the five he currently owns in Barcelona.
Getting a table at any of those can be tricky, particularly 
, where menu options may include a mini airbag with Manchego cheese foam, and a "trip around the world" in 14 oysters. (Bookings at El Bulli were even harder to obtain: the usual figure quoted was two million applications each year for 8,000 places.)
50 Days by Albert Adria runs from Feb. 12. through April 9. Despite the £150 per head set charge, plus wine and service, most tickets quickly sold out (though Adria doesn't rule out a possible extension).
The meal will start with snacks in the Cafe Royal's Oscar Wilde Bar and then move on to the Domino restaurant for a menu of about a dozen courses. 
The bar snacks might include a version of the exploding olive served in El Bulli. (That was olive juice trapped in a film of gel.) For London, Adria is exploring the possibility of adapting it to the flavors of an English pub, with Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco. He's also thinking about a canape of a smoked eel with jelly of its own skin. Even the time in the bar itself is inspired by the terrace where guests sat before their meal on the coast, north of Barcelona. 
"The easiest thing would have been to make a mix of the restaurants in Barcelona, but I don’t want to make a menu that doesn’t make sense, where suddenly you find a ceviche [just] because I have a Peruvian restaurant, 
," Adria says. 
"It's like the new Star Wars – people who go to see it have different expectations. Those who have seen the old movies are like the people who have been to El Bulli. And there's also a generation of new people that have only seen the latest movie."
"50 Days will be true to the past but it is not the same thing. For people who don't have that past connection, they will either like it or not. But we have to work with perceptions. My goal is to make as many people as possible happy."
"One thing I have come to realize is that more isn't necessarily better. At El Bulli it was different, but that was what they were selling there at that time. I don’t want to feel we are like a good movie that is 40 minutes too long." (The last time I dined at El Bulli, 
.)
Adria says he needs to see how 50 Days is going before even considering a brief extension to the London run. Also, he is working on separate projects in 
 and in Barcelona, where he 
.
Interviewed at the Cafe Royal, where he is helping to create the restaurant's layout, perfect the tableware and develop the menu, Adria is smiling and at ease. Will his brother come to London to try 50 Days?
"Yes, he will come. He is curious. He is like a kid.
"He is very excited about what is going on, what we're doing. And he was very easily convinced about this project. Normally, he says, 'No, no, no, think it through.' But this one he was, 'OK, when am I coming?'"

=== Title: Tudor North Flag Hands-On: Upping the Ante With Its First In-House Movement - Bloomberg ===

Big news from Baselworld: The new North Flag is the first Tudor watch to feature an in-house movement.
And it's mighty fine on the wrist. 
Tudor was founded in 1926 by Rolex patriarch Hans Wilsdorf as a less expensive alternative that would offer the same robust performance; a big part of that value proposition has always involved using stock movements brought in from outside suppliers. Creating its own movements is a huge step forward for Tudor and a major shift in the brand’s identity.
The North Flag is immediately recognizable as a modern Tudor watch. Its 40mm steel case has a satin finish and a combination steel-and-black ceramic bezel. The dial is also matte-finished and has luminous markings at each hour as well as a subtle date window at 3 o'clock. Bright yellow accents add some color and the hands 
, last year's big release. It's sporty, it's cool, and it doesn't get caught in the bling-watch bear traps that so many sports watches succumb to today.
Unlike any previous Tudor or Rolex, though, the North Flag has a sapphire caseback, letting you see the new MT5621 movement inside. This is a truly in-house movement—yes, designed and made by Tudor. It's automatic, chronometer certified (meaning it's extremely accurate), and resistant to both shocks and magnetism. Decoration is clean and attractive without being showy. It has a 70-hour power reserve, counted down on the dial side by a disc with a painted hand pointing to yellow markers. It also has hacking seconds, meaning they stop when you pull the crown, letting you set it precisely.
Watch buyers have been all but demanding in-house movements from brands over the last few years. Because of the significant R&D, manufacturing, and personnel costs associated with designing and making a watch movement independently, it's seen as a major source of both value and individuality to consumers. Additionally, Swatch Group is in the process of restricting sales of ETA movements (a popular supplier owned by the Swatch Group), ratcheting up the pressure on outside brands to find alternatives before the well runs dry. 
On the wrist, the North Flag is comfortable with angled integrated lugs and a more modest size (40mm as opposed to 41 or 42mm, like most Tudors) that allow it to sit evenly. Though the bracelet adds a little heft, it's a suitable daily-wear watch with either strap option. Little details such as the layered bezel and the power reserve disc make it feel like a much more expensive watch than it is. 
And that brings us to the price. As announced at 
Let that sink in for a minute. 

=== Title: Swiss Watch Exports Decline Amid Smartwatch Encroachment - Bloomberg ===

Swiss watch exports posted their first annual drop in six years, hurt by slumping demand for less-expensive timepieces that are competing for buyers with 
 and other smartwatch makers.

=== Title: TAG Heuer to Undercut Rivals With Cheapest Swiss Tourbillon - Bloomberg ===

TAG Heuer will undercut rivals with the least expensive Swiss-made chronograph featuring a tourbillon as the industry lowers prices to gain market share.
The 14,900-franc ($14,700) Carrera Heuer-02T will be showcased at the March Baselworld trade fair, the watchmaker, owned by 
, said Thursday. A tourbillon -- French for “whirlwind” -- is a spinning mechanism that’s one of the most complicated features of an automatic timepiece.
The industry is seeking new ways to gain clients after exports of Swiss timepieces dropped in 2015 for the first time in six years. Luxury watchmaker 
 earlier lowered its entry-level price to 150,000 francs from 298,000 francs.
The Carrera Heuer-02T will be the cheapest such chronograph certified by COSC, a Swiss regulator that checks watches for accuracy, according to TAG Heuer. The company will also sell 250 pieces of a limited version called the Black Phantom for 19,900 francs each.

=== Title: Kricket Brixton: Inside One of London's Best New Restaurants - Bloomberg ===

As career moves go, quitting a job in corporate finance to open a temporary restaurant in a tiny shipping container could be too risky for some.
For Rik Campbell, 27, who joined 
 immediately after graduating from 
 in politics and history, it might just work. Kricket, which serves small and inexpensive light Indian dishes, along with cocktails, was a hit from day one, garnering acclaim from professionals and punters alike.
Kricket's space in the 
community campus for startups is 40 feet long (12 meters) and 8 feet wide, with the kitchen occupying one-third. The container seats 20 at communal tables, with space for eight outside.
Less than a year after opening in south London last June, the restaurant seems set to expand, possibly overseas. 
 "We had a guy come in the other day, he enjoyed it so much that he wrote his number on a piece of paper and said, 'Call me: I have £100,000 to invest,'" says Campbell.
"Not even joking. We had a guy from Australia with shares in a group of companies and he said, 'You would absolutely kill it in Melbourne.' Talked about flying us out to look at sites over there.  We've had a lot of interest."
Campbell founded Kricket with his college friend Will Bowlby after spending three years as an associate in transaction services at Deloitte. Initially he planned to open a cocktail bar, building on his experience creating an events business at university. "By the third year, we'd built a pretty solid promoting and events business that turned over six figures," Campbell says.
After leaving Deloitte, Campbell worked part time in his mother's business while plotting his next move.
(His mum, 
, is no slouch. She spent 32 years with the Royal Bank of Scotland Group and now runs 
, the ATM provider that she bought in a buyout. She was named 
 in 2014.)
Campbell's friend Bowlby then returned to the U.K. after two years as a chef in Mumbai, where he worked at Cheval Bar & Restaurant. Together, they came up with the idea for Kricket. 
"It cost us £50,000 to set up the restaurant," Campbell says. "Half of that was done from our own savings and half was from a personal loan from a family member. And I am happy to say we are coming to the point where we have little or no debt. When we were getting started, a bank took us twice to the 11th hour and then dumped us out. We've got about £10,000 of debt and we've paid off all our costs."
Expansion to a second site, even overseas, is on the cards.
"But ideally, we want to retain 100 percent of our business, like everyone [does]. I'd like to build our brand a bit more, make it more valuable first. The plan is to do four or five in key locations around London, Brixton, East London, Soho, West London, maybe Bermondsey, and keep them not too big. We want to keep the quality, not overdo it.
"From people we've spoken to, I think Kricket could really work in cities outside the U.K., like Melbourne for example, San Francisco. A lot of these places really haven’t pushed the boundaries with Indian food."
(He still faces significant risks. The restaurant business is notoriously tricky, although the oft-quoted figure of a 90 percent failure rate 
.)
While planning expansion, Campbell and Bowlby have been spreading the word. They have done collaborations/residencies with East London venues such as 
 and 
  and plan a pop-up at 
.
How does all this feel after Deloitte?
"I feel great because I walk to work with a big smile on my face every time," he says. "I am my own boss. I don’t have to answer to anyone. I don’t have any investors. But it is much more stressful because you don’t switch off. 
"When Will and I opened, we were working every day for two months, seven days a week. And the problem was that you were tired, absolutely knackered, we looked awful. But we couldn’t get to sleep a night. All I was thinking is what can I do to improve this, to improve that. I went to bed with 10 things in my head I could do better the next day.
"The stress levels are definitely higher but it is a good stress."

=== Title: Richard Mille RM 07-02: A $980,000 Watch Made of Pink Sapphire - Bloomberg ===

When you want a watch to be lightweight and durable, you make it out of steel or titanium. When you want it to have some gravitas, you make it out of platinum or gold. And when you want it to be totally absurd, you make it out of solid pink sapphire. I'm not even kidding with this one.
The new 
 from Richard Mille, nicknamed the Pink Lady Sapphire, is an automatic watch encased entirely in pink sapphire. It's important to note that this pink sapphire case isn't carved out of a massive, naturally occurring stone. It's made from the same sort of synthetic sapphire used for watch crystals. First the huge piece of pink sapphire has to be created in a lab with sufficient purity and clarity to allow the light to shine through without inclusions. Then it takes almost 40 days for CNC machines to mill the case shape out of the block. If something goes wrong, the whole thing will crack or shatter and must then be thrown away. The cost to Richard Mille of making one of these cases is more than a lot of luxury watches cost at retail. It likely runs into five figures, although reps declined to confirm the exact amount.
Once you get past the sapphire, you'll find other precious materials involved, too. The central dial section is a piece of smokey mother of pearl, and set around the dial and into the winding rotor on the back are dozens of small diamonds. The entire movement is itself made from solid red gold, including the winding rotor, with a grained finish and beveled edges throughout. The skeletonizing shows off the gears and mechanics inside while leaving enough gold to let the wearer thoroughly appreciate it.
The RM 07-02 isn't all about looks, though. Say what you will about Mille's choice aesthetic, his engineering is downright brilliant. The titanium screws used to hold the case together are a special design that reduces the torque involved in sealing the case parts together, which keeps the sapphire from cracking and ensures a tight seal. The balance spring in the movement is also free-sprung, and a watchmaker can adjust its weight distribution to get super-accurate performance, plus the winding rotor can be fine-tuned for the right amount of force. Mille didn't pull any punches here.
The price tag? A whopping $980,000. That's a lot less than the $1.65 million that Mille's last all-sapphire watch, 
, sold for, but it nonetheless makes the RM 07-02 one of the most expensive watches commercially available today. It's not a limited edition watch, but the combination of a difficult production process and limited demand means will probably limit production, anyway.

=== Title: Google, Intel, and TAG Heuer Team Up on Luxury Smartwatch - Bloomberg ===

Swiss watchmaker 
 is creating a smartwatch in partnership with American technology companies Google and Intel. The watch is an attempt to compete with devices by consumer-electronics makers, particularly the much-hyped watch by Apple. While TAG is the first traditional watchmaker to pair with Google, the partnership could open the door to other collaborations with high-end brands owned by LVMH, including Hublot and Zenith. One of the questions raised by Apple's $10,000 gold smartwatch is whether users will consider it a luxury item and wear it for status as well as convenience.
In his announcement at the Baselworld watch expo today, LVMH watches chief Jean-Claude Biver said this was his "biggest announcement ever" in his 40 years of working in the industry. He predicted the device would be the "greatest connected watch." David Singleton, the head of Android Wear development for Google, added: "When I think about the watch, it's always been a marriage of beauty and utility. We're going to do that with our partnership." TAG Heuer is set to handle design and manufacture, while Intel will provide an SoC platform and Google will lend its Android Wear platform and help develop software. The watch is set to be launched by the end of the year, at which point price and functions will be announced.
The global market for smartwatches may rise to 28.1 million units this year, from 4.6 million in 2014, with Apple capturing 55 percent of the market despite its belated entry, according to researcher Strategy Analytics. Even for the typically conservative Swiss watch industry, these numbers prove too large to ignore.
The number of Swiss watch brands adding electronic features has blossomed since Apple joined the battle for customers' wrists. 
, Breitling, Montblanc, and 
 are among those that have entered the fray, with products ranging from a messaging device that clips to a watch strap to a gold-plated watch containing a fitness tracker. TAG Heuer’s smartwatch won’t be made in Switzerland, with the company relying on partners in Silicon Valley and the usual international electronics supply chain instead.
This isn’t TAG Heuer’s first foray into electronic devices. In 2008, the brand introduced a mobile phone called the Meridiist, and the 2013 Oracle Team USA Americas Cup team (sponsored by TAG Heuer) wore electronic wristwatches with sailing-specific functions co-developed by TAG Heuer and partners.
"The difference between the TAG Heuer watch and the Apple watch is very important," Biver said. "That one is called Apple and this one is called TAG Heuer."
 

=== Title: Piaget's Newest Watch Is an Electromechanical Marvel - Bloomberg ===

For this one, you need to leave your snobbery about mechanical watches at the door. Piaget's latest creation, the Emperador Coussin XL 700P, uses a new hybrid movement that combines mechanical power with electronic timekeeping. Once you get rid of anti-electric bias, you realize just how awesome this is.
The foundation for this new watch is the Emperador Coussin XL collection, a group of timepieces that blend clean dress-watch looks with the kind of oversize proportions you see more often on sport watches. This bad boy is 46.5 mm across and is solid white gold, meaning it's probably best to start working out your wrist if you want to wear one. The black bezel is ADLC-coated and does a nice job of giving the case some needed contrast and visual structure. While I'm not sure I agree with Piaget's marketing department in describing this watch as elegant or black-tie appropriate, it's certainly striking and handsome.
But the movement is what really matters here. First, a refresher on exactly how a mechanical watch usually works. A standard mechanical watch feeds power from a tightly coiled mainspring (the thing you wind by hand) through to a balance wheel, which swings back and forth three or four times per second, counting out the time. That wheel moves a little fork back and forth, and with each tick and tock, a gear is turned. That gear then turns other gears, and you get hours, minutes, seconds, and whatever other units of time are tracked all from those little movements. That wheel-fork system is called a regulator, and it's what allows a watch to keep time.
Here, Piaget has kept the mechanical spring as the power source and is still using gears to implement the timekeeping, but the mechanism actually keeping the time is a quartz crystal (like what you'd find in, say, a Swatch). What makes it different from a lesser quartz watch, though, is that instead of a little circuit board telling the first hand to move once per second, the quartz crystal regulates the movement of a spinning flywheel, which in turn controls all those other gears. The crystal oscillates at 32,768 Hz vs. the 3 or 4 Hz you get from a traditional watch. This means you get a perfectly smooth seconds hand and a much more accurate watch.
The technology is new for Piaget, but it's not the first to try something like this. Most notably, there's 
 line of watches (including 
), which all function like this. An engineer at Seiko first had the idea in the ’70s, but the first Spring Drive watches rolled out only in 2005. Piaget decided to go down this route to commemorate the 40th anniversary of its very first quartz movement, the 7P, which was one of the first luxury quartz watches produced in Switzerland, a decendent of 
. While Piaget might not be first to the party here, it does seem like a development that makes sense, not simply a bid for customer attention.
To make sure you don't miss anything, Piaget placed both the winding rotor for the mechanical spring and the regulating wheel front and center on the dial. It actually took me a second to find the hands the first time I looked at the 700P (they're down to the right, FYI). The movement is also blackened and skeletonized with polished gears, another way to make sure no one mistakes this for a cheap quartz knock-off.
Piaget has not yet announced a price for this watch, and it really could be anything. It's hard to predict what the R&D costs are to develop technology such as this, especially since only 118 pieces are being made, so we'll have to wait for SIHH in January to see just how expensive this watch is going to be. The big question for me, though, is a larger one: Is this a standalone tribute watch or will Piaget be developing more electromechanical watches down the line? I seriously hope the answer is the latter. 

=== Title: Here Are the Problems With The $10,000 Gold Apple Watch - Bloomberg ===

So, Apple has released a $10,000 watch. It's one of the most expensive products Apple has ever produced and the brand's first attempt at creating a real luxury good. Apple didn't divulge too many details about the watch and where it will be sold, and the questions remain who’s going to buy it and why?
The big rub with the Apple Watch Edition is that the watch is technically identical to its lower priced siblings. Unlike with a traditional mechanical watch, where an increase in price is also typically accompanied by more complex mechanisms and more hand-craft, the Apple Watch Edition is simply shrouded in gold. If you set that case aside, it has the same sapphire glass display, sensors, and electronics as the $549 Apple Watch. That's a mark-up of eighteen times the lower price.
Some people will think the gold is beautiful; the yellow doesn't photograph well, but looks better in person. (I personally prefer the look of the fake gold 
.) There's also rose gold, and both make the watch much heavier and less practical for daily wear. Compared with the aluminum Apple Watch Sport, it feels like a brick. Sure, you're not running a marathon with the thing, a la Christy Turlington, but you don't want your wrist to tire before the battery. 
Apple is careful to point out that the 18k gold used is a proprietary alloy that's between two and four times harder than typical gold. According to 
, this special gold is created by impregnating a gold matrix with ceramic particles for added toughness. In the same patent, Apple also alludes to future cases made of silver and platinum, so this might not be the only Apple Watch Edition we see.
A hardened gold alloy isn't an innovation unique to Apple. Since 2012, Swiss watchmaker Hublot has been using a proprietary alloy called Magic Gold that is also a mixture of ceramic and gold certified as 18k. However, Magic Gold scores close to 1000 on the Vickers scale, making it more than twice as hard as Apple's gold, using a ceramic matrix to support gold particles (the opposite of Apple's method). Apple has also taken other materials from traditional watchmaking like aniline-dyed leather and sapphire crystal, which have been used for decades.
The Apple Watch Edition will see limited production, though there's no word yet on what exactly counts as limited. Distribution will be restricted to select retail locations, though Tim Cook was careful in today's presentation not to limit this to Apple Store locations. There has been speculation that the Apple Watch Edition could be sold alongside tradition luxury watches in jewelry and watch boutiques, though this is yet another detail that will not be revealed until closer to the launch next month.
The has been no mention yet at all of the biggest elephant in the room: what do you do with a solid gold watch when it becomes obsolete? One would hope for some kind of trade-in or recycling program that prevents all that gold from sitting unused in a drawer, but it will likely be a while before we know of anything real. (Many $10,000 mechanical watches actually rise in value after you purchase as the years go by.)
Ultimately this signals a small shift in Apple's identity. Apple's mobile devices have always been the attainable luxury products for the everyman, but these are true luxury goods much closer to a Gucci clutch than an iPad.

=== Title: The Swiss Have Finally Started Making Luxury Smartwatches - Bloomberg ===

Everyone’s been waiting for it, and now it’s happened: The Swiss have finally entered the smartwatch fray.
Coming only a few weeks 
 it will release a smartwatch to compete with the Apple Watch, a new Swiss company called Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT) has introduced a line of smartwatches made in Switzerland. MMT is a joint venture between Silicon Valley wearable-technology company Fullpower Technologies and Union Horlogère Holding, which owns Swiss watchmakers 
 and 
. You might think you haven’t heard of Fullpower’s MotionX technology, but it’s what powers your swanky Jawbone and Nike wearables. MMT was created specifically for this project and is headquartered in Geneva, allowing it to market the watches as officially Swiss.
Before the end of 2015, MMT will release 10 different models under the banner Swiss Horological Smartwatches. These will be split between the Frederique Constant and Alpina brands and will include models for both men and women. The details have been made available for only two models, one from each brand, and the remainder of the collection will premiere at the Baselworld trade show in March. Watches will go on sale in June, and prices will start at $995. The gold-plated Frederique Constant model shown below will retail for $1,295.
Before we get too deep into the clumsily named Swiss Horological Smartwatches, we need to be clear on what MMT means by “smartwatch.” The category is extremely loosely defined and can include everything from a 1980s-style Casio wrist calculator to devices like the Samsung Gear S and the Apple Watch. A Swiss Horological Smartwatch sits somewhere in the middle. It’s like the 
 (not a bad thing), as it tracks activity and sleep, and then it displays that information on an analog dial and through a smartphone app. Sorry, no texts, Instagram, or Tinder—there’s no digital display on the watch itself.
The “smart” parts of the watches are basically the same across the platform, even if the cases, dials, and straps vary. At 6 o’clock on the watch dial, you’ll find two concentric subdials in addition to the big hour and minute hands you’re used to. One of the subdials shows the date, with the addition of a sleep indicator and a counter up to 100. This can be used to display progress toward a goal set through the app, like number of daily steps, and both iOS and Android are supported.
Part of MMT’s strategy is to license the technology to other watchmakers as the 
 continues to grow. Fullpower currently has more than 45 U.S. patents issued and more than 75 additional patents pending for everything from sensors to software. While giants such as Swatch and TAG Heuer have already begun work on their own smartwatches, MMT sees its platform as giving smaller and lower-priced brands a way to get into the smartwatch game with a sophisticated system.
Mondaine, best known for its Swiss Railways watches, is the first third party to take advantage of the MMT technology, and its new timepiece was also announced today. The Helvetica No1 Horological Smartwatch (seriously, is there no one working on these names?) looks just like 
 but with that extra dial at 6 o’clock. The watch will also be unveiled at Baselworld. As the trade show approaches, we’ll be curious to see whether any other partners announce similar Swiss Horological Smartwatches.
Looming over all of this is the multibillion-dollar question: Is this the kind of smartwatch people actually want? 
There are certainly upsides to a smartwatch like this. By using a battery-powered quartz watch movement and Bluetooth low energy, there’s no recharging required (just a battery swap every two years or so). The indications are clear and simple, so it’s easy to incorporate the device into your life without any major changes. And, possibly most important, it has a form factor and an aesthetic that customers are familiar with and that’s already an aspiration for many consumers. In other words: It looks handsome and makes sense.
There are also some serious hurdles to clear. Fitness trackers have been doing what a Swiss Horological Smartwatch does (or something close to it) for years, yet most customers stop using these devices within six months of buying one. This might be OK for a $150 rubber bracelet, but it probably won’t fly for a $1,295 gold-plated watch. Additionally, it’s going to be tough to compete with more feature-rich devices, especially once price becomes a factor. Without mechanical movements, these are still consumer-oriented devices that probably won’t appeal much to the watch collector.
As the Apple Watch is set to completely transform the wearable-tech ecosystem in ways we can’t yet plan for, releasing an analog smartwatch is a bold move. We’ll just have to see whether it’s one that’s ahead of the curve or behind the times.

=== Title: Hublot Classic Fusion Carlos Cruz-Diez Watch - Bloomberg ===

Sometimes calling a watch a work of art is meant figuratively. In this case, it’s literal. The 
’s dial is a kinetic work of art created in partnership with the artist himself—and it’s bonkers.
Cruz-Diez is a Venezuelan artist best known for making pieces that change as the viewer moves around them (and for the installation in the lobby of the 
). For the watch, Hublot asked him to start from his 1964 work 
The piece involves a screen print of bright colors with a distorting medium in front that, when moved, creates new colors and shapes as the visible areas shift. (
 if you can’t quite picture it.) The idea was to bring the same principle from a wall-mounted installation to a tiny watch dial.
The watches start with Hublot’s basic 45-millimeter Classic Fusion case, in either black ceramic or king gold (a proprietary alloy with a higher platinum content). Then things get crazy. The actual watch dial is printed with an array of bright colors, but you never get to see the dial on its own. Over the top is a black grid that produces an almost eye-watering visual effect, as the dial looks different from every angle. To enhance the effect, the grid rotates every minute, completing a full revolution in 12 hours, so the appearance evolves over the course of the day. You can see it at work here:
If one of the core watches isn’t enough for you, there’s also a limited-edition tourbillon model. Same 45mm case, this time in platinum, with a choice of different-colored composite rings around the case, plus the same mechanical dial. Below the black grate you can see the one-minute tourbillon whirring away. Even excluding the rest of the dial, I really like the partially hidden tourbillon here; you get the complication without it being quite as blingy (though I don’t think anyone afraid of bling is going to be wearing one of these).
The watches were unveiled internationally on Monday at the opening of 
,
a retrospective of the artist’s work at Espace Expression Gallery in Miami, though they’d been shown previously in Venezuela. 
The 
 in king gold ($46,580) is limited to 40 pieces; the ceramic ($22,580), 50 pieces; and the tourbillon ($210,000), just 10 pieces, available exclusively at Hublot’s Miami Design District and Caracas boutiques. All three come with both alligator straps and a special strap with an iridescent look meant to mimic that of the dial.

=== Title: Own a Real Cosmonaut’s Omega Speedmaster X-33 Watch - Bloomberg ===

Space watches are the ultimate sport watches, aren’t they? Forget deep-sea diving, flying fighter jets, or hauling up the world's tallest mountains; there's nothing like rocketing past the atmosphere that captures the mix of nerdiness and machismo that attracts watch collectors. Just over 500 people have left the earth and come back, and Christie's is giving a true fanboy a chance to own one of their watches. 
As part of its latest online-only watch auction, Rare Omega Watches, Christie's is offering this Speedmaster X-33, worn by Russian Cosmonaut Sergei Zalyotin on multiple missions at the turn of the century. While traditionally NASA and a few other space agencies used the Omega Speedmaster Professional as their mechanical timekeeper of choice, the thought was that by 1995 technology had come far enough that the decades-old chronograph was outdated and no longer the best tool. So Omega was asked to come up with a successor and what we got was the strange X-33. 
First, the X-33 is an electronic quartz watch, making it more accurate than a mechanical watch. The 41mm case is made from titanium to reduce weight and increase strength, and the dial is a hybrid of analog and digital displays. The basic time display still uses hands but the chronograph and alarm functions utilize the LCD screen to simplify the dial. The crown also adjusts functions with a series of presses, which is supposed to make it easier to use with space gear on. In addition to being used by astronauts and cosmonauts, the X-33 was often issued to military test pilots as well.
Zalyotin was given this particular X-33 by the Russian Federal Space Agency in 2000 and he wore it that year on a mission to the Mir space station as well as on later missions to the International Space Station. According to Christie's, this is the only wristwatch to have ever been worn on both space stations. The watch is being sold by a collector who purchased it directly from Zalyotin and included with the box, papers, and accessories are two signed photographs of the cosmonaut himself.
It's been a big year for space-worn watches selling publicly. Usually, because the watches worn by astronauts, cosmonauts, and other space travelers are equipment issued by space agencies, they remain in government hands forever. But when they do make it to public markets, prices are appropriately high. In December, 
 for nearly a quarter-million dollars, and just a few months before that 
 fetched over $1 million. 
This Omega Speedmaster X-33 is part of Christie's online-only Rare Omega Watches auction, which runs from Jan. 28 through Feb. 9. The estimate for this watch is $10,000 to $20,000. 

=== Title: The Nine Ugliest Watches of Baselworld 2015 - Bloomberg ===

A lot of 
 were shown at Baselworld this year, but also a lot of terrible ones. Whether it’s a case of too much bling, anachronistic design, or a bout of flat-out ugliness, bad timepieces were out in full effect.
Here are the worst offenders (and what you should be looking at instead):
This is as good a place to start as any. Technically speaking, the movement is exciting, with two types of rotating escapements packed in side-by-side. But the brushed platinum case feels blobby and unrefined, and the movement finishing, hands, and luminous numerals feel like something out of a failed Michael Bay movie. The best thing about this watch is that only 50 will be made. Oh, also it costs $373,130.
Instead, reach for the more refined 
. It’s the same impressive mechanism in a properly detailed package.
Oof. This watch takes everything great about Rolex—understatement, tool-watch credibility, versatility—and throws it out the window. Sure, it’s still built like a tank, and crafting colors to match those gemstones is harder than it looks, but please check yourself before asking your local Rolex dealer to let you try this one on. One color scheme apparently wasn’t enough, so Rolex is offering green, orange, and purple variations. Pass on all three. Price is on request, but like we said: Don’t even ask
Instead, check out the 
 on the funky new Oysterflex rubber bracelet. It’s a little weird, but darn cool.
You can talk to me all you want about craftsmanship, tradition, and dying arts, but I still can’t get behind this one. Jaquet Droz specializes in automata and repeaters, but this execution feels like a copy of something from a museum instead of a wearable timepiece for 2015. Also, I’m sorry, but watching tiny enamel birds feed one another isn’t the most appealing thing I can do with half a million dollars. Cost is 500,000 Swiss francs (about $520,000).
Instead, grab Jaquet Droz’s 
, with its tiered enamel dial and simple layout.
This watch is the perfect example of “just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should.” Omega, we know you’re really awesome at making ceramic watches and that white ceramic requires extreme levels of expertise. The Dark and Grey Side of the Moon watches (especially the latest releases) are killer, but this has none of the cool-guy cachet. It’s more Ed Hardy T-shirt than Balmain jacket, and the only blemish on an otherwise impressive collection from Omega. Price is $12,000.
Instead, snatch up one of Omega’s other 
 watches, especially the distressed vintage edition. More Fonzie, less Sonny Crockett.
Yes, this is exactly what it sounds like. And yes, those figures do exactly what you think they do when you press the pushers. It’s really hard to have any reaction to this watch other than “Seriously?!” It’s crass, it’s tacky, and it will set you back more than a new Maserati. There’s actually a long tradition of erotic automata and watches, but some traditions die out for a reason. This should probably be one of those traditions. Price given upon request.
Instead, check out Ulysse Nardin’s 
, which has a traditional chronometer dial and a technologically advanced escapement. It’s pretty much the opposite of the Erotica.
He might be one of the world’s greatest soccer players (if not the greatest), but Cristiano Ronaldo’s watch falls shorter than the U.S. World Cup team. The shade of green was chosen because it’s the color of a soccer field. I’m not kidding—I wouldn’t have been able to make that up. From the matte black case to the carbon dial to the CR7 logo at 3 o’clock, the whole thing looks like a promotional toy. It’s a far cry from the other awesome chronographs TAG showed this year. This one costs $1,450.
Instead, skip right to the TAG Heuer 
, which looks almost exactly like the original 1962 Carrera. There’s nothing more fun than fooling vintage watch collectors.
There are lots of things you don’t need on your wrist. A moving replica of an oil derrick is definitely one of those things. Chronograph maker Louis Moinet has connected the escapement to a rotating system that moves the derrick at 12 o’clock up and down as the tourbillon spins. It’s as cheesy as a dueling bear and bull automaton would be, and if you’re caught sporting one, everyone will know you just need better work/life balance. Price is 300,000 Swiss francs (about $312,000).
Instead, look to the 1770 MicroMegas double tourbillon from fellow independent brand 
. It’s still plenty adventurous but with some easy-to-appreciate panache, too.
For the 10th anniversary of its Big Bang collection, Hublot went a little too big and made 10 different gem-set Big Bang watches, each a single unique piece priced at $1 million, for a $10 million collection. This version, covered head-to-toe in black diamonds (including the strap's buckle), is a dust-and-fingerprint magnet that screams “I swear I’m really cool, just look at my watch!” loud enough to drown out a full house at Madison Square Garden. If you can believe it, the ruby edition is even worse.
Instead, steer clear of the diamonds and go for the 
, made of Hublot’s proprietary scratch-proof gold. It’s twice as hard as 
.
I don’t know how Arnold Schwarzenegger finds the space to include “body builder, actor, governor, and watch designer” all on his business card. Good problem to have, I guess? You would think the seasoned collector of watches from the likes of Panerai and Audemars Piguet could come up with better designs than Terminator skulls and barbell motifs, but apparently not. That said, I can’t help but chuckle when I look at them, which is something, I guess. Still, Arnold should probably stick to workout tapes. Prices range from $565 to $2,790.
Instead, just don’t buy a watch. Seriously.

=== Title: Where Chefs Eat in London: The Best of 2015 - Bloomberg ===

Chefs and restaurateurs know more than most of us about eating out and about changes in the London dining scene.
So which new establishments have they enjoyed most this year? After giving 
 on London’s best newcomers, I asked more than 30 of the U.K.'s culinary stars for their views.
They chose restaurants spread around London’s centre, from Brixton and Clapham in the south to Hackney in the east, Islington in the north, and Mayfair in the centre. London’s affluent western neighborhoods, among them Kensington and Notting Hill, miss out this year.
Here's what the chefs had to say.
"
. The menu is classically British with great, carefully sourced ingredients which Tomas Parry lets speak for themselves. I like the simple and pure décor at 
, as well as the menu of simple yet delicious Portuguese sharing tapas dishes. The combination of the two creates a joyful and laid back atmosphere. Last but not least, 
 offers a mixture of sophisticated traditional Chinese specialties and creative fusion dishes."
"
. It's relaxed dining with some top British Cuisine. And 
. It's a lavish new addition to London - think red velvet curtains and 1930s glamour."
"
. I love it. I can go back anytime and it is exactly what we need in Frith Street (Soho). What a street!"
"
. The environment is a bit basic. It's all about the food and the service, and I love the food. The puddings, especially, are very original, although the menu has a classic element as well. I also like 
. They have kept the values of a traditional pub and added great food and service."
"
, in Clapham. I love Robin Gill's food. It's unique and it's clean, with no bells and whistles. It's just a very good restaurant. 
, in Brixton, does great barbecue. it's cheap and cheerful and packed with great flavor. Food is moving out of Mayfair and the West End. You can get really top cooking away from W1."
"
 is a really good restaurant and it's unusual for anyone to do something with such impact from a standing start. The food is delicious. It’s really simple thing done incredibly well: It's just chops with flatbread that soaks up the juice, and the sides are great. A neighborhood restaurant that stands out is 
. It's excellently conceived and executed Indian food with near-zero resources. I love it." 
"
. It's great to see someone doing old-school classics really well. I love the feel of the place and the snail pithivier was amazing. The service was warm and friendly."
"
. It's refreshingly different, not bandwagon-jumping. It's tiny, it's cramped and it's noisy but the food is brilliant. What I like particularly is if you order the whole menu, they send you a shot of Jameson."
"
. I really enjoyed it on every level. Chef Tomos Parry has done a great job and I love the size of the space , style of service and of course some of the legendary dishes that I see every day on my Instagram. It has become a new classic very quickly. In fact, I must book in again soon."
"The 
 on Rathbone Street. I just love the food. It is very simple, with English produce. Also Jun Tanaka's 
. It has just opened and it is very promising."
"
: Their day-to-day food is great but the Sunday roast is something else. And 
. They (
) get it right every time, every restaurant they open: The food, the decor. It's almost annoying. And I love 
 in Broadgate. He puts his heart and soul into it and you can feel the love in the food.  I like to go there after work and have a beer and a few small plates.  The prawn fritter are insanely good."
"
. The chef is fantastic and it is a great wine list. The menu changes all the time. It is nothing too fancy, just very good."
"
 in the City because they are doing the kind of tapas I really like to share with friends. The quality of the ingredients is very high and the prawn fritters are the best."
"
. I really enjoy it. It's very relaxed. There's only a limited menu but there are good daily specials and some cracking wines you might not normally get. The cooking is very good. We also had a cracking meal 
, which has just opened."
"
. There are many exiting restaurants in London now but if you want to go somewhere classic, to a grown-up restaurant, Piquet has really great cooking and service."
"
.  The food is wonderful and it is near my home, so I like to go there. 
: It's beautiful and it feels like it has been there for a long time, which is an achievement for a new restaurant. And 
. It's great to see street food moving into restaurants."
"
. Nieves (Barragan's) food just gets better all the time.  The dishes are simple; the ingredients are impeccably sourced; the food is always delicious. And there's always a great fun vibe."
"
. The style of cooking is very simple. It's based on the ingredients and it is very tasty. I like 
 because it is a new style of cooking for us. Portuguese cuisine isn't normally considered to be part of the elite of cooking but there are some good dishes. I love 
. I am not a big lover of Indian food but 
has the right balance of spice. It is one of my top discoveries of this year. 
 is another. The quality of the ingredients they use is something you find in three-star Michelin restaurants."
"
. I went with a bunch of guys from work and we had a really good time. It was fantastic. The food is simple but really good."
"
 is such an unadulterated, unbending labour of love that it really makes itself stand out. Lee (Tiernan) is an amazing cook but didn't want to do the same kind of stuff as he did at Bread and Wine but focus on his love of Turkish food. Also Kate, his wife, is a very charming host."
"
. It's a great addition to the London scene. I used really to enjoy their street food on 
 and it's fantastic that they are now so busy in a great Soho site. My other favorite opening is 
, in Hackney. It's a very clean design and clean food. I really like the space."
"
. It is so neat and tidy and the food is consistent and delicious. The service is  very charming and they are doing really well.  I love seeing customers lining up : It gives you a good feeling.  And 
. What they are doing is really lovely. I love the gruyere and truffle macarons."
"
. Nuno (Mendes) went back to his roots, and his respect for ingredients is second to none. He can do great Michelin star cooking but also great rustic food without compromise. I had a fantastic dinner at Park Chinois. The duck is to die for. I was also impressed by 
. It's great to have such a good restaurant in Islington."
"My favorite opening of the past 18 months or thereabouts is 
. I love it so much and sometimes I wish our place was more like it;  other times, I'm happy we are a little different. More recently, I have loved 
, 
 and the 
 on Adelaide Street. They are all instant classics. London really is firing on all cylinders right now. And it's brilliant to see Ed Wilson back in the driving seat at 
."
"
. It used to be called Mission but they have a new chef, new manager, new sommelier. The food is amazing. And I was blown away by 
, in Brixon. The food there is amazing. There's a little bit of Goan influence and it reminds me of my days in Goa. And I like what Leandro Carreira is doing at 
. It's Portuguese but it's his style, a little different."
"
, N5, which opened about 18 months ago. It's got the most refreshing natural wine list and the food is simple yet flawless. I had the most deeply flavoured mushroom barley risotto last time i was there. It is really, your ultimate neighborhood restaurant."
"
. It was the most memorable meal of the year. For me, it wasn't so much about the food. (That level of spicing doesn't sit well with me at lunchtime.) It was everything else:  The welcome, which was incredibly warm and genuine:  the level of staff knowledge and the attention to detail, which is among the best I have come across in London. I also enjoyed 
. The room is understated, the welcome is very reassuring and the food is delicious."
"
. I love Sri Lankan food and here it is delivered with such style and taste."
"
 and 
were great openings that showed brilliant diversity in the London food scene.  I had my standout London Sunday lunch at the 
, in Hackney. I love 
. And Aulis (the research kitchen at 
) is very exciting, with great, unique and special cooking."
"I'm a Neanderthal when it comes to new restaurants: I don't seek out new places. I like 
 very much: I enjoyed the concept of pared-down with nice food and nice staff. The cooking is very good. I also like 
, 
 and 
."
"
. It's my favorite restaurant of the year and I have eaten nothing better than their pork sandwich."
"
. There's something deeply satisfying about fried chicken and KFC is unjustifiable these days, so I was very happy when this place opened. the fry is always perfectly crisp and ponced-up with some pickled watermelon on the side. And 
. The pork pluma is insanely delicious, along with just about everything else on the menu."
"
 was a real stand-out for me this year. In less than two months, it has already become a huge hit with its southern Indian/Sri Lankan influences. It's a great example of how the London food scene is becoming more diverse in its approach to new concepts and regional cuisines."
"
. Since its relaunch, it perfectly reminds you what a brilliant institution it is. It's a symbol of London restaurants' old-school glamour and hospitality. It's nice to sit in such a glamorous room and eat bangers and mash, or shepherd's pie. 
 is another favorite. I like the seasonality of the ingredients and the flavor from cooking over wood. I went the other day and had a brilliant plate of langoustines. I like the simplicity. It's fun."
"
. I liked it a lot. It has a classy feel and a really nice balance between dining and entertainment. The food was good. It's nice to shave something very chi-chi with a different menu so I like the fact that it is Chinese. It is glamorous and sparkly."
"
 .They've really hit on a great concept there and the food is delicious. The new 
 bar is also superb: The wine list is predictably brilliant, one of the best in London. I also like 
 for classic, all-day dining in opulent, sophisticated surroundings. The food is great, too."
"
. It's simple and pared back in just the right way - great service, exceptional (and craveable) food, very good value for money, unpretentious environment."

=== Title: McDonald's New Premium 'Signature' Burgers: Are They Good? - Bloomberg ===

Even 
  the world's largest restaurant chain, has noticed the emergence of small burger outfits such as 
 and 
 that are helping to change tastes in the U.K.
The Oak Brook, Illinois-based company is trying out a new 'Signature Collection' of premium burgers in 28 stores in London and the south of England. They've been designed by a team of chefs, feature 100 percent British and Irish beef and are made to order.
At £4.89 ($7.58), they are expensive by the standards of 
, where you can pick up a cheeseburger for £0.99, but cheap compared with MeatLiquor, there 
, and Byron, where 
.
So are they any good? Richard Turner, the executive chef of 
 steak restaurants (where 
) agreed to put them to the test. Turner is also co-owner of 
 meat suppliers and takes his beef seriously. (He's writing a book on it.)
Turner is not a McDonald's hater: He has visited corporate headquarters in Illinois, says the company in the U.K. uses good ingredients and has even been known to order the occasional Big Mac.
Here's what he had to say at the taste test of the new Signature Collection in the Cannon Street outlet of McDonald's, in the City of London.
"The packaging looks great: It's nice and clean. The burger is very neat, well put-together. But the bun is sweet and the patty is dry as hell. There's not enough fat and the grain of the meat feels woolly. It needs an awful lot more fat to make a good burger and (as is always the way with McDonald's) it's well done. Because it's a thicker patty it's actually harder to eat than the other ones. It's not as good as a Big Mac, which has a thinner patty, more salad, more moisture. This is trying to be a modern burger like a MeatLiquor burger, but without the meat, the fat and the cooking needed. There's 30 percent fat in a good burger. This is probably 10 percent. We went through a period in the '80s and '90s and later when we cut the fat but fat is flavor and juice and moisture. McDonald's are still doing that here. They are giving us a lean burger. The bacon is OK. It's not bad. They are trying harder but the problem is the patty." 3/10
"The overriding flavor is barbecue sauce and it's not a very good barbecue sauce. It tastes a bit cheap and synthetic. These are good-looking burgers. I didn't want to come in here and slate them. McDonald's isn’t a bad company in this country. It's fairly ethical, they use reasonable ingredients. It's easy for me to sit here and pick it apart but when you're rolling this out, there are safety margins you put in. Like maybe they can't cook fatty burgers because of the risk of fire. I am just guessing. But this is disappointing. Again, it's not as good as their standard range. They've dropped the ball. If they're going to make a better patty, they need to add fat. This is pretty horrible." 2/10
"This is actually quite well-seasoned and it's got loads of sauce on it and quite a bit of salt in it. So it is actually quite tasty but again the patty is bone dry. It's saucier, it's moister and it's juicier but not the patty, just the ingredients. This is the best of the three because it's got salt in it and sauces in there making up for the bland, tasteless dry meat, and chili covers a lot of ills. 4/10
For comparison, we tried the regular Cheeseburger.
"It's a much thinner patty. It doesn’t matter that it's overcooked with no fat in it because the ratio of meat to the rest of the ingredients works better. It's still not a great burger but it's a better burger than those three. It's still sweet as hell. It could be a dessert."

=== Title: Monday Morning Find: This 1970s Ingy SL Is an Unsung Masterpiece - Bloomberg ===

Gerald Genta is the most important watch designer you've probably never heard of—and this is his unsung masterpiece.
Watch designers rarely get much public credit for their work, since it's the brand's name that sits on the dial instead of their own. But Genta is regarded by many collectors to be the most important watch designer of the 20th century, his most important creation the high-end steel sport watch. First he designed the 
, which debuted in 1972, and then came the 
 in '76. Both of these watches get tons of attention, but the same year the Nautilus appeared, so did a more understated Genta creation from IWC: the Ingenieur SL.
The Ingenieur first debuted in 1955, but it looked more like a dress watch than what you see here. It was designed to be a watch for engineers, who came in contact with magnetic fields at work, and was resistant to the negative effects of magnetism on the watch's inner workings.
The watch was made for well over a decade, but it wasn't until the introduction of the Ingenieur SL in 1976 that the design got an overhaul. The sporty 39mm case has a round bezel held down with five evenly-spaced screws and broad shoulders that mesh with the custom bracelet.
It's a bold watch and one that wasn't terribly commercially successful—IWC says it only sold about 550 SLs, making them highly collectable.
Even more than with most watches, the details make this watch what it is.
Look at the dial straight on and it appears to be deep black. But tilt it just a bit and the combination texture and checker-board pattern reveal themselves. The hands and baton hour markers are steel, and all but the central seconds hand have luminous fill, so you can read them in the dark. The date window at 3 o'clock is black with creamy print, making it blend in much better than a white disc (a cheaper, but not nearly as refined, solution).
If you have any doubts about the Genta provenance here, just look at the SL's bracelet. It's nearly identical to what you'll find anchoring the Patek Philippe Nautilus, but with fatter H-shaped links and rounder central links. Genta's bracelets are some of the most comfortable ever made, so the fact that you can't put a leather strap on this watch isn't going to be a problem at all. 
IWC has continued to make watches under the Ingenieur name, but straying from the original tool-watch-for-nerds archetype hasn't gone well. The 2013 collection of oversized carbon fiber and titanium chronographs were some of the least appealing watches IWC has ever produced. Luckily, the current collection does include 
 that is clearly modeled on the SL you see here. It's awesome and a great alternative if you like the look of the vintage original but want something built like a tank.

=== Title: Best New Perpetual Calendar Watches for Leap Year 2016 - Bloomberg ===

Since 2016 is a leap year, all but the most complicated calendar watches are going to be flummoxed come the end of February. The perpetual calendar (also called a QP, an abbreviation of the French term 
) is the tool for the job, seamlessly counting everything from seconds to leap-year cycles so you never have to fiddle with it. Since we know you've read our complete 
, we'll stop here and just show you the five best new QPs for 2016. 
As part of the newly revamped pilot's watch collection, IWC added 
 as the crown jewel. It's the rare perpetual calendar that doesn't try at all to be a dress watch. If you wear a suit to work, keep this one (on a watch winder) for the weekends. The movement has been used in previous models, including an Ingenieur and a Portuguese, showing the date and month, each with oversized windows instead of small hands. The 46-millimeter case is massive; IWC also fit a chronograph in there, for good measure.
 
There is no better deal in perpetual calendars than this Jaeger-LeCoultre, period. It's that simple. For $20,400, you get a fully integrated in-house movement with automatic winding and a moonphase indicator on a sleek, brushed-black dial, all packed in a slim, stainless steel case. The 39mm case is only 9mm thick so you get the right balance of comfort and legibility; there is a lot of information to parse. It's a real stunner. Showing the full year on the dial is a little novel and divides collectors into two camps. I could probably do without it, but it doesn't detract from this otherwise immaculate watch.
 
For its latest perpetual calendar, Vacheron created an elevated take on a simple daily-wearer. The case looks like that of the
, but it's much slimmer, at 8.1mm, and it's white gold instead of the more utilitarian steel. The gray and blue dial looks just modern enough to balance the extremely traditional dial layout, with the months for all four years in the cycle in that top register. You get a metal bracelet, alligator strap, and rubber strap that can all be swapped without tools, so you can keep it fresh. Sure, the $91,400 price tag puts it in the upper echelon of QPs, but that's right where it belongs.
 
The Royal Oak was the original luxury sport watch. This version dials back the sport and amps up the luxury in a package that's still pure Audemars Piguet. The solid yellow gold case and integrated bracelet look extremely fresh against a sea of rose gold watches (contributing to the $95,700 price tag), and the deep blue dial displays the day, date, day of the week, week in the year, year in the leap year cycle, and phase of the moon, not to mention, the time. Bonus: The movement is new and completely in-house.
This is what watch aficionados knowingly refer to as "serious business." For years one of Lange's most complicated watches, this version—priced at €315,900 ($345,000)—is also one of the most expensive. The display is unique, with the month around the edge, the day of the week as a retrograde scale on the left, the big date, a small window at the bottom for the leap year counter, and a discreet moonphase in the seconds register. This new combination of gray dial and white gold case breathes life into a true modern classic.

=== Title: Burma and Myanmar: From Junta Repression to Luxury Tourism - Bloomberg ===

It's happy hour in the bar of 
 in Yangon. 
A smartly dressed barman mixes a Strand Sour as fans slowly revolve below the high ceiling. Musicians play. Tourists at tables beside the teak-lined walls check guidebooks and discuss where to go for dinner.
How about 
, an elegant villa on the shore of Inya Lake? It serves fine French food, and offers an $87 tasting menu featuring dishes such as lobster salad, prime veal fillet in pistachio crust, and Grand Marnier souffle with orange sauce. Or maybe the hotel's Strand Grill, with its vaulted ceiling and marble-inlaid floor, where lobster thermidor costs $44?
 It's no longer the British colony where my father was born in 1904, nor the 33-year-old independent state (then called Burma) I first visited in 1981, then returned to in 1992. That was a scary place, brutally governed.
In 1992 the country was ruled by the State Law and Order Restoration Council, 
 that held onto power even after Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy 
.
Visiting then as part of a group of Hong Kong-based foreign journalists invited to see that things really weren't as bad as they were reported overseas, one thing quickly became clear: they were. 
My taxi was followed at night, and foreign diplomats spoke knowingly of the ways of the junta's intelligence-gathering efforts.
“Their methods aren't that sophisticated,” a foreign envoy assured me when I interviewed him the following day. “Just pulling out fingernails, that kind of thing.”
When no-one else was close enough to hear, people would whisper their support for Aung San Suu Kyi. A cabbie wouldn't risk being seen driving me past the villa where “The Lady” was detained. He dropped me a block away and took a detour to pick me up on the other side. (These days, the road past the house, decked out with bold posters for the National League for Democracy, is busy. Then, it was quiet.) 
One of the official minders in 1992 boasted to me that I was being followed and that they knew who I was meeting.
One Burmese man publicly engaged me in conversation to practice his English. A policeman quickly appeared and began shouting before handcuffing him behind his back and then hitting him in the face. He hauled him off to a police station. I followed to register my outrage. My courage quickly evaporated when a desk sergeant began to question me and I left. I’m rather attached to my fingernails.
My father was born in Mandalay on Nov. 24, 1904. When I first traveled to Burma in 1981, after his death, it was virtually a closed country, with only half dozen cities accessible to foreigners. The maximum tourist visa was one week.
Most foreigners then would travel a loop, taking the train to Mandalay from Yangon (then called Rangoon) - a gruelling, daylong journey - and then spend another uncomfortable day, plagued by mosquitoes, sitting on the bare deck of an old boat to Pagan. That ancient city, with thousands of temples reaching to the horizon. was stunning and unspoilt. Now renamed Bagan, it is becoming a popular tourist destination.
Junta-era Burma seems so distant today, when modern-day Myanmar is opening up. Traveling in the country today, it is clear foreigners are now welcome. Roads are busier, with monuments and cultural landmarks spruced up, as these images of Yangon's Sule Pagoda in 1981 and 2015 clearly show. 
Yes, there is poverty away from the tourist sites. Even in Yangon (the new name for Rangoon, and no longer the capital - that honor goes to 
), many people work hard during the day before returning to ramshackle homes. I watched one woman on a building site construct a tower of bricks on her head before delivering them to the bricklayers. As I stopped to stare, she simply smiled.
In years past, travel was slow and uncomfortable and accommodation was generally basic. Today there are luxury hotels and fine restaurants; new airports are served by taxis with meters that work. A country that was always strikingly beautiful and full of friendly (if nervous) people is now waking up. 
The Strand, which opened in 1901 and became a sister to 
 was badly run-down but also inexpensive. By 1981, lobster thermidor still cost just $1. The hotel was only in marginally better shape when I returned in 1992. In December 2015 it was truly luxurious, with prices to match.
My suite cost a total of $851 for two nights. 
With its polished teakwood floors and wicker chairs, the hotel is almost the last word in colonial style. But the 
, where I also stayed in Yangon, comes close and costs more. This property is owned by the company whose hotels include the Cipriani in Venice and Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons near Oxford, in the U.K.
For two nights I paid £696.86, the equivalent of $1,045.
The Governor's Residence occupies a colonial-style mansion dating from the 1920s in the embassy quarter of Yangon. There's al fresco dining beside the pool, shaded by tropical vegetation. And there's an Indian buffet at about $48 a pop that you might care to try after a $90 facial.
You don't have to pay much to eat well in Yangon. I had a great Indian dinner at a shop called Nilar Biryani & Cold Drink for 11,600 kyats ($9) and paid rather more ($78) at 
.  (Most of that was for wine.)
The changes are almost more striking in Mandalay, my father's birthplace. Arriving by train at night in 1981, I remember no street lighting, while transport was by pony and trap or bicycle rickshaw. This time, I flew with 
 roundtrip from Yangon. The streets are now filled with cars, motorcycles and trucks. 
I stayed at the boutique 
, with tea served on the terrace in the afternoon and cocktails by the pool at night. There's a spa and a good restaurant.
On my last day in Mandalay, I set out to find the chapel where my father was christened in 1904. An old church, east of the moat that surrounds Mandalay Palace, fit the picture I had. It was built around the turn of the century and was rundown. I had to find someone with the key to let me in.
Honestly, I don't know if it was the right place, but even with the rumble of traffic outside, the heat and the thickness of the air, it was peaceful. I loved Burma when I first visited 34 years ago. That fascination continued in those disturbing days of 1992 and is in no way diminished by development.
And now that Myanmar looks set to emerge from decades of repression, there is finally hope.

=== Title: Five Avant-Garde New Watches from SIHH 2016 - Bloomberg ===

The past year might have been tough on the Swiss watch market, but that doesn't mean top watchmakers are slowing down or dumbing down their creations. In fact, if one looks around the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) watch show in Geneva this week, one sees countless examples of brands big and small doubling down on their most extravagant creations, adding new complications, turning concepts into reality, and making modern classics better. Here are five watches that prove there's still horological ground to be broken in 2016.
Last year 
 (the RD1), a prototype that was supposed to be a totally new kind of minute repeater. Sure, it sounded great, but there was only a single working model, details were mostly under wraps, and it was never going to be for sale. This is the production version of that watch. It's a massive titanium tourbillon chronograph with a special chiming mechanism inside. By using a new kind of mounting system for the resonating gongs and an altered mechanism for striking those gongs, the Super Sonnerie produces loud, crisp sound you'll want to hear over and over. (Good thing, because you will.) Only 50 will be made, it will take two years to make them all, and each will sell for $597,400.
Yes, what you're looking at is a watch that actually tells the time. As if 
 wasn't crazy enough, the mad scientists at MB&F have gone a step further and made the front and back portions of the case entirely out of sapphire. In total are 11 pieces of sapphire: a front plate, a back plate, five domes on the front, and four domes on the back, and they're sealed off with a bright blue gasket so the watch is still entirely water resistant. The clean cover lets you see all the mechanics, including the angular gears and the adjustable metal shield that can be closed over the tourbillon. It is available in either red gold (350,000 Swiss francs, approximately $348,000) or platinum (380,000 Swiss francs, approximately $378,000) and each will be limited to just 10 pieces.
 was one of my favorite watches from SIHH 2015. While that was mostly an aesthetic update, this year Lange's totally reengineered the watch from the ground up. The result is a sporty platinum chronograph with a sleek black dial that packs a large date, moonphase, perpetual calendar, and power reserve indicator up front and a beautiful tourbillon in the back. To add the tourbillon to the movement, Lange had to start nearly from scratch, and therefore the caliber looks distinct from that of its predecessors. This is the rare megawatch you could actually wear every day. Only 100 pieces will be made, with a price of 295,000 euro (approximately $320,000). They're going to go fast.
Back in 2011, Greubel Forsey showed a concept movement with two balance wheels, each tilted at 35 degrees. 
 were made in the ensuing years, but this Double Balancier is the first real production piece to feature the idea. The angle has been adjusted to 30 degrees, and the balances have been placed so they can never be perfectly vertical and horizontal, respectively. To start, Greubel Forsey is making 33 pieces, all in white gold, with a 350,000 Swiss franc (approximately $348,000) price tag. This is a watch that was worth waiting half a decade for.
Montblanc has been somewhat split as a watchmaker over the past few years, making more affordable watches targeted at mainstream consumers while also dreaming up crazy movements at their Villeret manufacture. This model is the first in the accessible Timewalker collection to feature a movement from Villeret, and it's a doozey. For $39,400, you get an aggressive-looking tourbillon with Montblanc's signature chronograph layout (with the two little dials below the main time-telling dial). It's the best of Montblanc's two worlds. 

=== Title: The Watch that Saved a Classic Company: The Audemars Piguet Royal Oak - Bloomberg ===

There's a point in the world of horology at which rugged sport watches and dizzying complications meet. The Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar is that point. 
When the Royal Oak made its debut in 1972, it was a time-only sport watch in stainless steel, the very first to house a meticulously finished movement inside a well-detailed steel case. It is widely credited with being the first luxury steel watch, in fact. Until then, Audemars Piguet was known for making dressy perpetual calendars, chronographs, and minute repeaters, almost always in gold and other precious metals.
Sales were down and the company was in a rough spot, so it took a gamble that would pay off handsomely. The Royal Oak became an icon, sending shockwaves through the watch industry. More recently, it has become one of the most widely seen watches on the wrists of celebrities and athletes around the world. 
Eventually, Audemars Piguet would build on the Royal Oak, adding complications and features to the octagonal case with signature screws around the bezel, usually keeping the integrated bracelet in the mix, too. (Versions are available on leather straps, but the bracelet is as important as any other part of the Royal Oak, if you ask me.) 
This 
 for sale from an Italian broker (price on request), is one of my most favored versions of this watch. It dates to the 1990s (reference 25654, for the nerds out there), so it's not technically vintage, but it looks and feels more like a vintage watch than you'd expect. The silver dial has a soft texture, instead of the waffling you usually see on the Royal Oak, making it a little more elegant. The slim hands are easy to read, while unobtrusive. There's also no leap-year indicator, further cleaning up what can sometimes be a cluttered type of watch. At 36 millimeters across, it's smallish by today's standards, and the slim case and comfortable bracelet make it wear like a dream.
Audemars Piguet just came out with a 
 that's pretty awesome, too. The case is a little larger, at 41mm, and the caliber 5134 movement inside is larger than its predecessor as well. The movement is crazy thin for a perpetual: only 4.31mm. Overall, it's a great reincarnation of the Royal Oak Perpetual, though I wish there weren't the 52-week counter around the edge of the dial, with a full-length hand. It clutters up the dial with a piece of information no one realistically needs at a glance. The watch is available in both stainless steel ($60,900) and red gold ($95,700), although I think this is a watch at its best in the more rugged, understated steel.

=== Title: Ten Spectacular Sport Watches from Baselworld 2015 - Bloomberg ===

Sure, it's Monday, and you may be strapping on 
 like the ones we listed for you last week, to go with your office kit. But slim, fancy, gold perpetual calendars aren't the right accessory for 
 occasion. Sometimes you want something more robust, more sporty. Luckily, the Baselworld expo running right now in Switzerland showcases every kind of watch; here are ten off-duty timepieces that will have you dreaming of a few days vacation.
In addition to 
, TAG Heuer released a number mechanical watches that balance value and good looks. The Carrera Caliber Heuer 01 uses a beefy Carrera-style case to frame an open-worked version of TAG's in-house chronograph movement. It's one serious piece of engineering and shows it all off. It might be a little aggressive for some, but if that's your thing, it's hard to do better for anywhere close to the same price. 
You might not think of Japan when you think of bomb-proof dive watches, but Seiko's been making them for 50 years. To commemorate the anniversary, the watchmaker released a number of special editions, and this is our favorite. It's rated to resist water pressure at 300 meters (deeper than even most pro divers go), comes on an extremely comfortable bracelet, and doesn't look a bit like its Swiss cousins. That it's limited to only 1,000 pieces is the cherry on top. 
Speaking of Swiss dive watches, this blue chrono from Blancpain is tough to ignore. The case is matte grey ceramic (pretty cool, right?) and the blue dial looks vivid even in dim light. It houses the same in-house flyback chronograph movement as its black sibling and wears really well. The only downside is that the 250-piece limited edition is likely already sold out. 
This is one of those watches I didn't expect to like nearly as much as I did. It's kind of brash, it's large (46mm across and 49mm tall), and the skeletonized case and dial are a little ornate. But, I can't help it, I really enjoyed the few minutes I got to spend with the Spidolite on my wrist. It's really well designed, wears comfortably (even on my small wrist) and kept me intrigued the whole time. The rose gold version also impressed, but titanium is definitely more beginner-friendly. 
British military watchmaker Bremont's newest collaboration with Boeing included a pair of complicated watches, one basic and one chronograph. The simper option, the Model 1, is about as good as a modern GMT watch can get. It's lightweight because of the special titanium alloy case (courtesy of Boeing's engineers) and the GMT is easy to set and read. Forget flying a plane as a pilot, I just want to wear this in business class. 
Tudor made waves the first day of Baselworld by 
. In addition to using the movement in the new North Flag, Tudor is also utilizing it in a new blue version of the Pelagos dive watch, which is inspired by 
. I don't love that there are now five lines of text at the bottom of the dial, but the color is superb and the titanium dive watch is one of the best out there. There is also a new black version with the in-house movement which will replace the old Pelagos by year's end. 
At 43mm, this watch is downright small for a Breitling (though I'd still like it a tad smaller). The style is faithful to vintage Breitlings without being contrived or overdone, and the faded luminous phosphorescence on the numbers doesn't have any of that muddy "we couldn't quite figure out how to simulate age" color to it. If you look closely you'll notice the two-tone quality to the dial—which is even better in person. The mono-pusher feels great and the chronograph action is crisp and precise. It's limited to, you guessed it, 1915 pieces. 
People were a little puzzled when Rolex unveiled its big novelty for 2015: a rose gold Yachtmaster with a matte ceramic bezel and rubber bracelet. Sure, it's a little confusing, and I'll admit I wasn't thrilled at first, but on the wrist the new Yachtmaster is spot on. It's comfortable, the dial has a ton of depth to it, and that rubber/titanium Oysterflex bracelet (yeah, that's a thing now) makes you rethink the difference a good strap can make. There's also a smaller 37mm size, which is actually great if you're into vintage-sized watches. 
Creating an in-house chronograph movement is the stick by which true watch manufactures are measured. Here, Alpina has packaged a brand-new in-house chrono caliber (that has a flyback function, no less) into a sturdy steel case for an aggressive price. The black and white dial is easy to read with big patches of lume at the hours and on the hands, and the telemeter scale around the edge is a nice nod to military aviation. 
Some people love chunky dive watches (see that Seiko above), but others like a slimmer option that still evokes a trip to Nassau in the 60s. This Oris diver has funky numerals, a discrete date window at six o'clock and a period-appropriate Tropic-style rubber strap. If you have a James Bond fantasy, but want the conveniences of modern waterproofing (and not shelling out $50,000+ for a Connery-style Submariner) this Oris is an awesome choice.  

=== Title: French Chef Who Worked With Jamie Oliver Returns to His Own London Kitchen - Bloomberg ===

French chef Greg Marchand and his wife, Marie, have picked London for their first establishment outside Paris, where their fashionable 
 restaurant and neighboring wine bar are regularly packed.
The menu at Frenchie Covent Garden, scheduled to open in February, will reflect its Paris counterpart on Rue du Nil in the 2nd Arrondissement, where Marchand's 
 and laid-back style is influenced by 
, Spain and the U.K., as well as by French tradition. He will use mainly British ingredients.
Marchand is a veteran of British kitchens: Frenchie was the nickname given to him by Jamie Oliver when he worked in the TV chef's kitchen at 
restaurant. He also worked in London with chefs 
in Foliage at the 
 and 
 at the 
, as well as with 
 owner Nick Jones at the 
, before moving to New York to join 
. He opened Frenchie in 2009.
French restaurateurs don't have a great track record in London, where 
 before Le Chabanais closed earlier this year. How concerned is Marchand about his reception in London?
"I'm very scared because I understand that the market in London is much more competitive and complicated than in Paris," he says. "The economy is much better, people have much higher spending power, there are so many restaurants here and the level of expectation of customers is much higher in London than in Paris. But I don't think other French chefs have spent as much time in the U.K. as I have.
"I spent years here and I now have an apartment in Covent Garden. I've spent three days a week here for the past month and at the opening it will be five days." He plans to return to Paris at weekends to see his son Tom, aged seven, and daughter Lily, who is four.
The London restaurant, designed by Emilie Bonaventure, will feature an informal ground floor restaurant and bar with whitewashed walls and exposed brickwork, similar to the Frenchie Bar a Vins and Frenchie to Go in Paris, with 18 seats available at the bar for walk-ins.  The basement will be home to an open kitchen with tables, where a tasting menu will be served along with a la carte options.
He aims to keep prices down, with a set lunch priced at about £22 ($33) and three courses for about £28. He is expecting average spending (including tax and service charge) of about £40 at lunch and £60 at night. 
Marchand says he and his wife will own 100 percent of the establishment, for which they received financial backing from Bpifrance, the French state-owned investment bank. He says he has spent months scouring flea markets with Bonaventure, a stage designer, and that he's involved in every detail of the restaurant. He says it was a similar story when he opened Frenchie in Paris, where Rue du Nil is now home to several food businesses.
How did the terrorist attacks in Paris affect him? Was he there?
"We were at the restaurant and heard about it on the social media," he says. "It was quite far away, but then the news was they are still free and they are coming your way. So we closed and we got all the people in cabs, staff and guests. We opened Saturday morning for breakfast at Frenchie to Go and then we never closed. Obviously, we're not in the epicenter of what happened but it was just a way of saying ... we are going to go on living.
"So I asked my staff if you don’t want to work I understand. But we all got touched.
"The butcher on the street got two bullets in his arm and his girlfriend of 14 years has died. Today is the funeral. My head chef girlfriend's best friend died.  She was at the Bataclan. So we all got touched to a certain degree. The atmosphere in France right now is not great. I could really see it last week, when I came to London on Tuesday and I went back to Paris on Thursday. And it was grim and gray, and it was terrible.
"People are starting to get over it little by little. People are out again, sitting on the terraces of cafes. Let's hope it stops now."
Frenchie will be at 
. 

=== Title: MBF Legacy Machine Perpetual: Hands-On Video - Bloomberg ===

Usually the yearly Legacy Machine watch from MB&F is one of the brand's more sober moments, a chance for it to offer something a little more reserved and less out there than 
. This year things are a little different. There's no question about it: The Legacy Machine Perpetual is MB&F's most ambitious creation yet.
As MB&F founder Max Busser describes it, the Legacy Machine collection is meant to show what MB&F watches might look like if the company were operating 100 or 150 years ago instead of today. The 
 has all the basic elements collectors have come to expect over the past few years. The 44mm case has that exaggerated domed crystal to accommodate the 14mm balance wheel that hangs over everything else via the swooping bridge. The time is shown on that small white enamel dial (here accompanied by ring-shaped enamel subdials that appear to float over the skeletonized movement). And if you turn the watch over, you'll see the traditional finishing, including Geneva stripes, deep beveled edges, and mirror polishing, that adorns the other LM movements.
But fundamentally, the LM Perpetual is a watch about doing something new.
For this project, MB&F brought in Irish watchmaker Stephen McDonnell and let him try a totally new kind of perpetual complication based on a 28-day month, using only gears to make the adjustments. The result is an accurate calendar that won't experience as much wear and tear over the life of the watch by better managing power and tension within the mechanism. There are no springs to bend or snap, and gears don't have to rapidly speed through those extra days on shorter months. It's better engineering that makes the customer's life easier in the end, plus you can see the 650 components at work right on the front of the watch.
The first three Legacy Machines were all time-only watches. The first showed two time zones, the second used two timekeeping mechanisms to display one super-accurate account of the time, and the third was an attempt to make a smaller, more wearable LM at a slightly lower price point (not unlike this year's 
). The LM Perpetual moves in the opposite direction. It could easily have been a disaster, muddying up the clear vision of the line, but I think MB&F has done a nice job keeping the visual cues while creating an interesting watch that stands on its own and offers something genuinely unique beyond marketing language. 
The LM Perpetual comes in two versions, each limited to 25 individually numbered pieces. The rose gold version is lower-contrast, a little more conservative, and will set you back $145,000, while the platinum edition has a vivid blue dial behind all the mechanics and is priced at $176,000.

=== Title: How Colonel Sanders Inspired Student Who Went on to Help Found Nobu - Bloomberg ===

 co-founder 
 was a student at the 
 in the mid-1970s when he got to meet 
 - the face of 
. 
"He came to lecture at Cornell and I found out he was staying at the 
," Nieporent says. "And because I've got chutzpah, I went along with my housemate Ray Lund and knocked on his door. He was a total hero to me because I loved the chicken back 41 years ago, and I still love it today."
The hotel door was opened by the gentleman in the white suit, who was more courteous and welcoming than a couple of scruffy uninvited guests might expect. He took the time to talk with them, and to pose for photographs. As Nieporent was leaving and thanking him, he said, "Son, with boys like you, America's got nothing to worry about."
Nieporent has made his mark in hospitality. His Myriad Restaurant Group has opened about 40 restaurants around the world, including 
, which he created in 1990 with business partner Robert De Niro and  investors such as Bill Murray, Sean Penn and Mikhail Baryshnikov.  He opened 
 with De Niro and chef  Nobu Matsuhisa in 1994.
(How involved is De Niro?  "He is very active because he loves food and he loves the restaurant business. He's into it. When he's around I speak to him quite a bit. It's not like, 'Bob, we just changed the purveyor of the beef.' But I'll keep him in touch with our goings on.)
Nobu went on to become the ultimate celebrity destination in New York and in 
, which is still going strong almost two decades after it opened on Feb. 17, 1997. Nieporent says his partners initially weren't sure they wanted to open in London. He and Matsuhisa finally decided to visit the site in what was to become the 
 hotel on Old Park Lane.
"Nobu flew over on the Concorde and I took a late flight and landed in London in the morning," he says. "As my cab was pulling up at the hotel -  it was called the Londonderry at the time and it was closed - Nobu had a big smile on his face. I got out of the cab and said, "I guess we’re doing London." He goes 'yes.' We went around the corner had lunch, and got back on the Concorde."
It's difficult to overstate Nobu's impact on dining in London, where restaurants from 
 through 
 to 
 carry its DNA. Nieporent says the increased competition hasn't depressed sales at Nobu London or 
, which opened in 2005.
"We've never had a down year, which is curious because when you talk about all the competition, you'd think they would slowly but surely peck away," he says. "But the reality is that we have never had a bad financial year. We feed close to a thousand people a day in London between the two places." (Ubon, an offshoot at Canary Wharf, was less successful and closed in 2008.)
"I've been coming for over 20 years and I love it here," he says. "At one point I sort of related to it that it was about 10 years behind New York, but that's not true anymore. I would say you’ve probably caught up. I've always said that London is the best eating city in Europe."
Nieporent still loves New York, where his 
has won several awards as best new restaurant.
"It used to be a lot of restaurants treated customers like guinea pigs and a lot of the food was very experimental. And now the balance has leveled out a bit and restaurants are opening with the thought in mind of pleasing the customer, not just the chef. "
Colonel Sanders' influence hasn't rubbed off.

=== Title: Vintage Universal Genève 1940s Split-Second Chronograph - Bloomberg ===

When collectors clamor over Universal Genève, it's usually the affordable takes on triple calendars and basic chronographs from the middle part of the 20th century they're getting excited about. This here is another breed of Universal Genève chronograph, possibly the rarest one of all.
Looking at this chrono, something should stand out immediately. Yep, the numbers go to 24, not 12. This is because the watch was made for military pilots to use for navigation, so the watch keeps military 24-hour time. It takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, reading is quick and easy. To further enhance legibility, the watch is a massive 44 mm across (though it remains quite slim). Big even by today's standards, it was downright ludicrous when the watch was made in 1940.
Compared with the overall size of the watch, the chronograph registers are rather small, though they're still easy enough to read with the high-contrast printing on the creamy dial. The minutes counter is also unusual, in that it counts up to 16 minutes instead of the usual 15, 30, or 60. The chrono is also a split-second, so there's another hand hiding under the main chrono hand that lets you time a second event by pushing the button hidden in the crown. This is a difficult complication to engineer, and it was just starting to migrate from pocket watches to wristwatches in the '40s.
Powering the watch is a manually wound movement that has nice, if not ornate, finishing throughout. It's a Valjoux 55 with 17 jewels, and it isn't a movement unique to Universal Genève. In fact, it's the very same caliber that sits inside the famed Rolex ref. 4113 split-seconds chronograph, which became 
 at Christie's Geneva back in 2011. The big difference here is that the movement has been modified to show the time on a 24-hour scale, while the original (as seen in the Rolex) uses the usual 12-hour format.
That A. Cairelli on the dial at 6 o'clock might look familiar, too, and for good reason. 
through the Roman retailer, which was fond of co-branding its watches when possible. Because there's so much open dial space, it's almost necessary to keep the watch from looking like a dinner plate. That, and the simple Universal Genève signature at 12 o'clock, are the only markings other than those for tracking the time. There isn't even a tachymeter or telemeter scale around the outer edge. Simply gorgeous. 

=== Title: London’s Salon QP Is a Watch Fair for Everyone - Bloomberg ===

Trade shows in the wristwatch world tend to be opulent events populated by retailers and journalists, mostly closed to the outside world (the actual customers). They are less about celebrating modern watchmaking and more about straight commerce. Think of London's
 as the people's watch show.
Every November, all art is cleared from the Saatchi Gallery, and watchmakers move in. 
, a watch trade magazine owned by the
 newspaper, plays host to such household names as Tudor and Montblanc and to niche brands like Urwerk and Habring2. They all set up booths for three days.
"What makes QP special is that it's a public event," said Timothy Barber, who edits 
 and organizes the show. "You can pick up the watches, talk to someone like Kari Voutilainen, you can get up close with this stuff. It's fun. It's not too pretentious."
 three-story booths and marble facades are absent, and there's no free-flowing Champagne as at 
. Everything is relatively understated and accessible. No secret appointments, no pretension, and often the person you end up speaking with is the owner of the company, a watchmaker, or at the very least, an executive.
It all sounds romantic and idealistic, but there's an obvious upside for the brands to connect with customers in this fashion.
"We sell watches directly to clients; we don't deal in intermediaries" says Alexandre Meerson, who launched his eponymous brand last year at Salon QP. "This is really the only show where there is the right crowd of connoisseurs and where we can share who we are."
A few brands will offer new releases. These are mostly low key additions to core product offerings. (Read: watches people buy, not showstoppers that grab headlines.) In addition to brand exhibitions, this year's visitors can check out the full honor roll of 
, a display of colorful gem-set watches, and an historical overview of the chronograph.
Salon QP, at the Saatchi Gallery in London, will be open to the public on Friday, Nov. 13, and Saturday, Nov. 14. You can get all the details and purchase tickets

=== Title: Ressence Type 5 Has a Clever Advantage Over Other Dive Watches - Bloomberg ===

When Ressence first showed off prototypes of 
 watch in 2010, its system of rotating discs (instead of traditional hands) was something totally new. Then, with 
, Ressence upped the ante and added sealed chambers filled with oil to the mix. While the watches have contained a few different features over the years (date, temperature gauge, day of the week), the formula has always been pretty consistent. So the question for collectors has always been, "what comes next?" The answer is a dive watch.
The Type 5 starts with the same basic formula as Types 1 and 3 but adds some new features specific to diving. The 46 mm titanium case has a prominent silver-colored bezel around the main timekeeping dials, where the date indicator would be on the Type 3. It has grooves protruding from it between each of the 10-minute markers, letting you turn the bezel to time your dive (just as you would with 
). Crucially, it's not sealed inside the oil-filled compartment with the other discs, so it operates independently of the timekeep mechanism itself, and it's unidirectional, meaning you can't accidentally give yourself more underwater time than you have air for.
The dial itself contains a few indicators, all nested as with previous Ressence watches. The main hour dial now has big bubbly numerals at the 3, 6, and 9, making it a little easier to read quickly. What looks like the seconds dial is actually a "runner," a requirement for the watch to meet international diving watch standards (
). This one makes a rotation every 90 seconds, not every 60, and functions as a shock absorber for the oil inside the watch too. Finally, an indicator for the temperature of the oil sits between the sapphire crystal and those discs (giving them that seamless appearance). On the Type 3, that indicator was mostly for fun, but here it's critical, as on deeper or colder dives the oil could cool off, gumming up the works.
While a diving watch might not seem like the most logical direction for Ressence (I was pretty surprised when I saw a prototype a few weeks ago), there's a major benefit to a watch like this under water: Because the oil projects the markers up to the crystal's surface, you can view the time perfectly from every angle. There's no space between the crystal and the hands to create distortion or reflection, and the watch looks exactly the same in or out of water. There is a lock on the side of the case, too, preventing you from twisting the case to manipulate the time under water. That Ressence chose to make this an actual ISO-caliber diver (it's currently undergoing external certification) instead of just a "diving-inspired" watch, which is to be applauded.
The Type 5 isn't going to appeal to everyone who loved Ressence's earlier watches, though. While those have a restrained, minimalist aesthetic, this watch is a little more brash. The black and white are punctuated by bright green, blue, and red, the numerals are on the funky side, and the overall look is much bolder. These aren't bad things, necessarily. Rather than just create another extension of the Type 1/Type 3 families, founder Benoît Mintiens has made something genuinely new that might bring some new customers into the fold who found the previous models a little too austere. From early photos, I didn't think I would like the watch nearly as much as I did in person. It's new and different, but still very Ressence.
The Ressence Type 5 is priced at $35,800, putting it between the Type 1 and Type 3 in the lineup. The first pieces are hitting retailers now, and production will likely be limited to between 100 and 150 pieces per year, though it's not a limited edition.

=== Title: The 10 Best New London Restaurants of 2015 - Bloomberg ===

This hasn't been a stellar year for restaurants in London.
Yes, they have opened in record numbers. Yes, there are some exceptional new establishments. And yes, it's great that there are more casual places where you can eat well without paying through the nose.
But some of the most-anticipated openings were disappointments, and there has been a marked lack of originality. Trends have been followed rather than set. (How many more barbecue joints will the market take?) The third outlet of 
 was more exciting than almost all the "new" restaurants.
Most disturbing has been the spread of ageism, whereby restaurateurs turn up the volume to a level where only young people can stand it. White noise has replaced 
.
Despite all this, there were some great additions to the London restaurant scene. Here are the 10 best new places where I ate in 2015.
This small Soho cafe serves dishes from Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu and stood out from the crowd in 2015. The cuisine is little-known in central London and the cooking is stunning. It is so good, you may have to queue for a couple of hours to get to taste it. The bone marrow, varuval, roti (at £4.50/$6.83) is particularly good, as is the black pork kari (£5.50). The owners - chef Karam Sethi and his siblings in 
 - have opened a bunch of original establishments, including 
, 
 and 
.
This low-key restaurant has achieved prominence based on quality rather than publicity. The seasonal dishes are original and well-balanced, with just a few ingredients. The wine list is adventurous and keenly priced, and the service is professional while appearing casual. Snacks such as white truffle and Gruyere macarons, and crispy chicken skins with liver parfait, candied walnuts and muscat grapes cost just £3 each.
This is an unlikely best new restaurant as it traces its history to 1917. But The Ivy is exceptional since it reopened after a six-month refurbishment. I keep going back. It is glamorous, it is buzzy and the menu is as Catholic as I was in my years as an altar boy. I keep ordering the bang bang chicken (£9.75) and the crispy duck salad (£11.50) . The departure of some diners to the blingy 
(I always want to say Essex Fish) has improved the crowd at the Ivy.
No-one was more surprised than the owners when this small Mayfair establishment (which opened late in 2014) quickly became London's hottest restaurant. First-time diners may be surprised by how unshowy Kitty Fisher's is. There's a bar and a few tables on the ground floor and the main dining room and kitchen are squished into the basement. Chef Tomos Parry cooks on a wood grill, and the Galician beef (from old dairy cows) is a must. Kitty Fisher's is special. 
This restaurant and bar at the back of 
 represents a contemporary take on old-fashioned glamour. It's a welcome haven from the no-reservations smaller venues that are proliferating in London.  (I like a lot of them, but not all the time.) The menu offers treats such as a classic Welsh rarebit (£9.50) and knickerbocker glory (£12). The place is also fun just to go for cocktails.
Snuggled among the pseudo-KFC outlets of East London, Chick 'n' Sours stands out like a gourmet destination. It just doesn't look or feel like one. No money was wasted on fancy furnishings or designs at this local fried-chicken shop. All the effort has gone into sourcing great birds and then expertly seasoning and cooking them. Just try House Fry: drumstick & thigh with seaweed crack seasoning and pickled watermelon (£8).
The movement of street food indoors is one trend greatly to be welcomed. Bao was a stall on 
 in East London before the Sethi family backed its opening as a cafe in Soho. Bao serves Taiwanese snacks, particularly steamed buns with fillings such as slow-braised pork in soy sauce or lamb shoulder with coriander sauce and garlic mayo. As at Hoppers, you may face a long wait for a table.
Chef Jose Pizarro serves some of the finest Spanish food in London. It's not just that he can cook, which he certainly can. More important is the fact that he sources wonderful ingredients and refrains from messing about with them. His Presa Iberica shoulder cut of pork is epic, with a flavor so deep you seem to drown in it. A starter of pan-fried chicken livers with garlic, shallots and dry sherry is as rich as Donald Trump and much more palatable.
Portuguese food is little-known in London and chef Nuno Mendez's new taverna is a homage to the country of his birth. He has traveled Portugal in search of the best produce and wines. His menu here (with head chef Antonio Galapito) reflects his love of the cuisine. The custard tarts (£2.50) he serves at breakfast are epic and so soft you need to eat them with a spoon. Other favorites include the runner-bean fritters with clam and coriander juice (£5) and the cheese and charcuterie.
This tiny restaurant at POP Brixton, where you squeeze onto communal tables, serves small plates of Indian food, centered on Goan cuisine. The plates are among the prettiest I've seen and the flavors are complex and layered, with chili heat generally remaining in the background. The dishes are so good that it's best just to order the lot, though the Keralan fried chicken is particularly good, as is the kichri, which features smoked haddock and a raw egg yolk.
This ultra-luxurious Mayfair establishment resembles a 1930s Shanghai nightclub where Chinoiserie meets Art Deco. Every detail speaks quality and taste. The restaurateur is Alan Yau, who helped revolutionize Chinese when he created 
 in 2001. His attention to detail is extraordinary, from design through uniforms to food. The cooking here is impeccable, and the live music just right. Park Chinois has just opened, so it is too early for a full verdict, but it looks like becoming London's sexiest and most glamorous restaurant, a rival to 
.

=== Title: Watches and Wonders 2015 Best New Releases - Bloomberg ===

While 
 and 
 are the two biggest trade shows in the world of luxury wristwatches, they're not the only ones. This week 
 arrived in Hong Kong, bringing the first big burst of new watches since March. Most of the headline-making watches are either gem-encrusted or high-complication items made mostly for marketing. But I've sifted through the more outlandish offerings and found six that are understated and highly-wearable.
These are the new releases that matter.
Rolex might have the 
 out there, but it certainly doesn't have the monopoly. The new 
 has an oversized date window at 12 o'clock, as well as a circular day-of-the-week indicator at 3 o'clock. A running seconds dial at 6 o'clock and a power reserve meter at 9 o'clock balance the dial out, so things don't look lopsided. The eight-day power reserve (that's 192 hours) means you can put this into regular rotation with your other watches and not have to reset the day and date every time you strap it on. The massive 45-millimeter diameter size and dressier dial don't quite sync up for me, but if larger watches are your thing, this Portofino is a nice mid-level complication. 
 
The basic time-only 1815 is one of the simplest watches in Lange's line-up, as well as one of the best. It has a handsome, easy-to-read dial, sharp hands, and a versatile 40mm case. The movement inside exemplifies what German watchmaking is all about, with the large plate on top, the engraved balance cock holding the spring and wheel, and the high degree of decoration on every surface. 
 commemorates the would-be 200th birthday of the brand's founder and is made in Lange's proprietary "honey gold," which has a warm hue similar to that of the German silver used in the movement. There are only 200 of these, each individually numbered, and I can't imagine they'll last very long in the boutiques. 
 
Understatement isn't very common in the world of women's watches. The more diamonds and the brighter the colors, the more watchmakers seem to think women will want the watch. With the 
, Piaget takes a different approach. This watch is all about admiring the large moonphase complication that takes up most of the top half of the dial. Little details such as the star on the back of the seconds hand and the subtle textures in the dial make this a watch you want to keep looking at in search of more, and it all sits in a curved, 36mm case. The only glitz present is a fairly discrete wave of diamonds under the moonphase disk that doesn't overwhelm the rest of the watch. This is Piaget we're talking about though, so if you need more diamonds, you can opt for a diamond bezel as well. 
 
This is another take on Montblanc's popular 
 (like the one 
 star Rami Malek wore, 
) adapted to the Vasco da Gama theme that has developed across the brand's limited releases this year. With only 238 pieces made, Montblanc adds a red gold crown and bezel to the standard steel case, giving you the look of gold without the weight and price of a solid gold watch. The dial has also been spruced up with a stars motif tucked into the 24-hour dial at 12 o'clock and a 3D globe illustration in the seconds register at 6 o'clock. These elements are taken from the much more expensive models in the collection and make this watch look more complicated than it is. It's a little more in-your-face than the all-steel version with the plain dial, but it's still easy enough to wear day in and day out. €
 
Cartier invented the "
" in the late 19th century and recently resurrected it in wristwatch form. The signature style has hands anchored in the center of a transparent dial, so it looks as if they're floating in mid-air. (In reality, the mechanics are hidden around the edges.) Here, 
 an asymmetrical version to fit in a palladium Clé-style case. The contrast between the exposed mechanisms on the right and the totally see-through dial on the left (it's tough to see in this photo because of the white background, but your skin would show through the dial) is really stark and gives the watch an element of dynamism. If you've got hairy wrists, it's probably best to steer clear, but otherwise this is a watch that will baffle everyone you meet. 
 
Not every Panerai is big enough to use as a dinner plate. These models use the familiar 
 with angular edges and sturdy lugs, but it comes in a 42mm diameter instead of the more common 45mm and 47mm sizes. You can opt for either steel or red gold, and both are powered by Panerai's in-house P.1000 movement, which is hand-wound and has a three-day power reserve. While these might be Panerai's "entry level" watches, they punch far above their weight class and offer good value in both aesthetics and mechanics. 

=== Title: Thanksgiving Dinner 2015: 11 Restaurants to Try in London - Bloomberg ===

Let's face it, Thanksgiving and Britain aren't natural bedfellows.
Americans probably don’t want to be in London for Thanksgiving. As for us Britons, that last thing you need is a turkey dinner before Christmas. Right?
Well, not exactly. David McIntyre, executive chef at CUT by Wolfgang Puck, says his restaurant is always packed with both locals and expats for Thanksgiving, which quickly sells out. 
"We've been doing it since we opened in 2011 and it's been popular since day one," he says.  "About 90 percent of people go for the traditional fare."
So if you want to celebrate Thanksgiving this Nov. 26, here are 11 restaurants you might like to try:
The three-course menu features traditional dishes with a twist by Executive Chef Thomas Piat. A butternut and chestnut velouté with duck confit is followed by a dégustation of turkey including breast and leg galantine with all the trimmings; white sausage and sage stuffing, Brussel-sprout fondue, sweet potato purée and cranberry compote. Desert is pecan pie. The menu is available all day on Nov. 26.
This Covent Garden restaurant, an import from New York, is celebrating its Franco-American roots with a 
on Thursday, Nov. 26, only. The menu features all the usual suspects plus an option of baked cod with thyme and Parmesan crust.
This charming mini-chain of cafes is serving a Thanksgiving dinner in two outlets (St Paul's and Holborn) and it is safe to expect some fine pastries. The 
 includes turkey & mash cupcake as well as pumpkin soup and turkey.
This American-style barbecue restaurant with outlets at King's Road, Covent Garden and Canary Wharf offers a 
 served family-style, featuring butternut squash soup and herb-roasted turkey with Southern slow-cooked cornbread stuffing.
Executive Chef Nuno Mendes has created a Thanksgiving feast. Centre stage is hay-roasted organic turkey with sausage, truffle and foie-gras stuffing, buttered brioche and a sour berry jus (£32) with sides of maple bourbon sweet potatoes (£6) and green beans almondine (£6). Pecan Pie with Bourbon Cream is £9.
This is one of London's oldest American restaurants, tracing its history to the distant days of, well, 1991. It is housed in a quirky and dramatic building that was at various times a papier mache factory and a casino. The ambitious three-course menu offers plenty of choice, including blackened shrimps with sunchoke and truffle cream, shaved Blue Mountain truffle and pistachio crumbs. It is available on only Nov. 26 itself.
Chef Wolfgang Puck's CUT is one of the finest restaurants in London, with prices reflecting that. The Nov. 26 
is a wondrous thing, with a wide choice of dishes. There's just one catch, assuming you can get a table: the cost.
 (Unless you pick wagyu beef, where there is a £95 supplement for the Japanese version.)
American Executive Chef Seth Levine has created a seasonal feast. (He's a former Hell's Kitchen competitor with the scars to prove it.) It features fig brulee; autumn greens salad with spiced butternut squash, goat curd and apple cider vinaigrette; butternut squash risotto; and roasted turkey with cranberry sauce and chestnut brioche stuffing.
Served from Nov. 24 to 26. 
This pop-up promises lashings of South Carolina hospitality with a Thanksgiving dinner, accompanied by craft beer, small-batch Virginia bourbon and cocktails. The menu features slow-cooked turkey chilli with homemade sage cornbread; plain green beans become smoked cheddar jalapeno. And there is Pumpkin Pie on the menu. The dinner is on Nov. 21 at 
.
This American restaurant in Marylebone is serving a 
for lunch all day on Nov. 26 and 27. The menu includes a glass of sparkling wine, smoked turkey with oyster and country ham stuffing with collard greens and pumpkin pie.
 
This casual restaurant has been celebrating Thanksgiving for more than 15 years, including selling takeaway pumpkin pies. Both outlets are serving a special menu where the options include butternut squash soup, roast bronze turkey with chestnut stuffing and pecan pie.

=== Title: Hakkasan Restaurant to Hit U.S. Malls With Michelin-Starred Tea House - Bloomberg ===

Hakkasan Group, which grew from a basement Chinese restaurant on a side street in London to become a Michelin-starred global hospitality player, will step up its international expansion next year by adding two new establishments in the U.S. as well as entering Indonesia.
The new sites in malls at Houston and Honolulu mark the entry into the U.S. of the Yauatcha chain of dim-sum tea houses, which are more casual and less expensive than Hakkasan restaurants, known for fine dining and high glamour, with prices to match.
"Hakkasan is the kind of operation where you dress up and splurge whereas at Yauatcha you can just pop in for a cup of tea and a pastry or a business meeting," said Nick McCabe, Hakkasan Group president. "There is huge potential because it's more scalable than Hakkasan. It's always been my favorite brand in the portfolio."
The group is expanding aggressively, with revenue increasing almost 600 percent since 2012. It has outlets in Miami, New York, Las Vegas and San Francisco, as well as cities including Mumbai, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha and Shanghai.
In Houston, Yauatcha will open in partnership with Simon Property Group Inc. at the Houston Galleria. In Honolulu, it will open at the International Market Place, which is being developed by Taubman Centers Inc. and CoastWood Capital Group LLC with Queen Emma Land Co.
"It's a great way for us to take the brand into the U.S.," McCabe said. "We have to learn how the U.S. responds to the food offering and the experience. Once we perfect it, we can take it to the U.S. market."
"Yauatcha needs high volume to be profitable, which isn't the case with Hakkasan. So we wanted to maximize the footfall of the kind of customers we want, and we know they will be in those malls."
The group has had some big successes, including in Las Vegas, but was less successful when it opened a flagship restaurant in New York's Hell's Kitchen in 2012. The negative headlines included, "Broadway Turkey Serves $345 Peking Duck." McCabe said the company had got it wrong.
"It was the wrong piece of real estate and it was tough to turn around," he said. "We had a level of arrogance and it was like we were beating our chests: 'Here we come, New York.'"
"The choice of location maybe revealed a lack of understanding of the tribal nature of New York, where you need to get the right neighborhood and even the right street. But we try to learn from our mistakes and it has made us a lot more cautious."
The company even looked at closing Hakkasan and moving, but decided against it because the restaurant's luxurious fit-out cost millions of dollars and also the price of obtaining a new site would have been so high, McCabe said.
"All companies have failures but we always try to improve the odds," he said. "The level of research in new markets and the financial discipline we have now is far more stringent."
McCabe said Hakkasan's expansion always depends on finding the right partners, and that dictated the choice of Jakarta over other cities when opening in Southeast Asia. The development will involve three brands: Hakkasan; Sake No Hana, a Japanese restaurant; and Omnia, a nightclub. 
 
 

=== Title: Alinea Chef Grant Achatz Picks Best Burgers, Sushi, Pizza in Chicago - Bloomberg ===

Here's what he had to say, with a little prompting on particular cuisines:
"I like 
. Matthias Merges is a great chef. He was executive chef at Charlie Trotter's for years. It's Japanese yakitori primarily.  One of the great Japanese restaurants is Katsu. It's probably our favorite restaurant in Chicago. And it's a 
. They've been there for more than 20 years and not that many people know about it because it's way north. Just awesome sushi, like the best sushi I've had outside of New York, LA and Japan.
"For a burger, I enjoy 
. (Owner) Brendan (Sodikoff) used to work at 
and he's done a really great job in the city, opening very focussed projects. Au Cheval is a place where they have no qualms about giving people what they want. You get the burger and the burger is awesome.  They buy in the patties and they don't hide that.
"Typically if I 'm in Chicago I'm in my restaurant: I eat out more in New York than I do in Chicago. But I like
. It's kind of like the 
(in New York): Charcuterie, a lot of pork products, farm- to-table type cooking.
"I have two young boys 14 and 12 and the restaurants are all closed on Monday and Tuesday, so usually I cook at home with them. If we go out, we go up to Devon (Avenue) and we have Indian. We don't have a favourite Indian restaurant: We just bounce around. For Vietnamese, we go to a place called 
and we go have rice paper rolls and all that stuff. Or we go to Chinatown. We go down to Archer street and just bounce and they are all good.
"Mexican?  It seems clichéd but (chef Rick) Bayless:  You go to 
 (Grill) and it's awesome. But, then again, if you go into the neighborhoods you can find some casual Mexican cuisine that's really great. South American? I went to 
 when it opened about a year and a half ago. It's (chef) Gaston Acurio and it's very good. Other than that, there's not a whole lot of Peruvian going on here yet. It will come.
"Chicago deep-pan pizza? I've had a change of heart recently. I used to like it and now I don’t. It's too doughy. I prefer thin-crust. The best deep-dish, the best place to find it, would be 
 up on the west side. They have this cast iron pan they bake it in and the crust gets really crispy. That's where you should go."

=== Title: Vintage Rolex Watches in Rose Gold - Bloomberg ===

There's no question about it: we're in the era of 
.
But not all rose gold is the same, and not all rose gold watches are created equal. When it comes to vintage Rolexes though, the alloy is often overlooked and incredibly appealing. These are vintage watches you should be eagerly hunting down.
For most of the 20th century, yellow gold was much more common than rose gold, but when watches were made in shades of pink, they tended to be lighter and softer—reflections of the taste of the time. If you look at a pile of vintage rose gold watches, you'll see tons of variation, and almost none of the watches will look like anything made today. Therein lies the charm.
Almost all gold used for watches and jewelry is an alloy with various levels of other metals added to the pure element for color and strength. White gold usually includes nickel or palladium, while warmer shades use a mixture of silver and copper to dial in the right hue of yellow, pink, or red. Modern watch brands seem to prefer alloys with a higher proportion of copper, giving the gold an almost red color, on the assumption that men will prefer this to a pinker color. 
I'm here to challenge that belief. For proof, just take a look at the four vintage Rolex beauties below.
In vintage Rolex alone, there are enough hue options to satisfy almost any collector. You can jump into the deep end and opt for a pink-on-pink Day-Date, like this 
. The case, dial, and hands are all that soft shade of almost salmon-pink that is impossible to find in modern watches. Even the disks for the day and date displays have a pinkish hue that blends them in, and the mix of brushed and polished surfaces really shows off the gold. Think of it as the more accessible cousin to the 
 that fetched $1.5 million at the Phillips One auction back in April.
 
If you want to stick with an all-gold construction that has just a splash of rosy highlights, you can go for a simpler three-hand or date model from the 1950s, with either a 
 or 
. The extra color will soften the effect, and because the gold used in this period has a little less copper in it, it takes on a warmer tone. I still recommend holding out for a watch with a matching bracelet: Sure, you'll save money by getting just the head and wearing it on a leather strap, but the result won't be nearly as striking.
This may be more of an outlier than the other two, but as I've said before, 
 are under-the-radar hits waiting to happen. 
 uses a very light shade of 14 karat pink gold for the bezel, crown, and bracelet accents. The gold is almost beige because it's so light, but it pairs perfectly with the steel case, champagne dial, and darker gold markers and hands.
You can also dig farther into the archive to discover this 
, an unusual watch from the early days of Rolex. This example comes paired with a solid, pink gold, beads of rice-style bracelet made by legendary bracelet maker Gay Freres, a find in itself.
Next time you're looking for an elegant vintage Rolex, remember: Think pink.

=== Title: What Is a Calendar Watch: Date, Full, Annual, Perpetual - Bloomberg ===

 the calendar watch is a descendant of the sundial, which various ancient cultures carefully calibrated to a specific spot on the earth so the sun’s shadow would fall in exactly the right position over the face. But a watch that would tell the date, month, and year has only recently made its way from 
 to something more wearable.
“A calendar watch is not only a mechanical computer,” says John Reardon, international head of watches for Christie’s, “but also an artistic representation of the passing of time. Layers of mechanical artistry must work in perfect harmony to present a seemingly simple result: what day it is.”
The 
 (seen above) is a perpetual calendar watch. It automatically accounts for the shorter months, and even adjusts for the notorious challenge of February—that this month adds a day once every four years has bedeviled watchmakers for generations. The timepiece is also one of the slimmest self-winding ones on the market, and the latest in the brand’s collection since it kick-started the trend in 1925, says David Bonilla, technical manager of Patek Philippe in New York. And as long as you keep it wound, you won’t need to adjust it until March  1, 2100, the next time our calendar skips a leap year. It might even be your great-grandson who will do it. 
It’s a synthesis of time, space, and engineering and therefore speaks naturally to a large majority of watch lovers.
We need to add more than 160 components in about 1.8  millimeters of space. Some of those are as thin as a single hair, and they all need to be adjusted perfectly. In addition, the movement is extra-thin, which adds complexity because the space to make adjustments is very limited. 
In 1955, Audemars Piguet introduced the first perpetual calendar wristwatch with the indication of the leap year. Only 
 were made between 1955 and 1957. Although the ref. 5516 is 60  years old, it still looks so contemporary.
The Greubel Forsey 
. It uses clever technical solutions.
 
Consider it a gentle introduction to the idea of a calendar watch. The gold standard of this category is the 
, which displays the date on the right-hand side at 3 o’clock and the day of the week written across the top in a straightforward, less-is-more way—a design that’s remained mostly unchanged since it made its debut in 1956.
 
 
 
Now we’re talking. The day, date, and month are the three critical components of this watch, but it usually also includes an indicator for the phases of the moon, adding a little romance. Appropriately enough, the dial of this special edition 
 is made from a sliver of real meteorite. 
 
 
 
All the information of the full calendar, with more convenience: You need to push the watch forward only at the end of February. The 
 ingeniously positions the days of the week around the edge, while the month is located in a curved window at 6 o’clock. A large numerical date is right up top at 12 o’clock. 
 
 
 
You’ve arrived. These finely tuned machines account for leap years as well as the day, date, and month, so you need to adjust it only when a leap year is skipped (roughly every 100  years). Although there’s no day of the week indicator on the 
, a small arrow points out from the hour and minute hands to the 12-hour markers to indicate the month.

=== Title: Luxury Watch Bosses Respond to Swiss Franc Shock, as Confused as the Rest of the World - Bloomberg ===

Whether it’s on the busses to and from the fair or at lunch tables or over cocktails, you can’t go anywhere at SIHH this year without hearing people whisper “currency volatility” under their breath like they’re dirty words. (This is 
, after all.) The Swiss National Bank’s recent lifting of the cap on the Swiss franc in relation to the euro hasn’t eclipsed the excitement surrounding all the new watches, but the news is definitely in the background at all times. Everyone is sure the 
, but one key question remains: how big?
When the news hit last week that the SNB was lifting the cap, which had been in place since summer 2011, watch executives, retailers, and enthusiasts panicked. The artificial stability that had kept pricing tight between markets was suddenly gone only a few days before 16 of the most prominent luxury watch brands were set to introduce their new wares and to start taking orders from retailers around the world. It quickly became received wisdom that this was bad news.
After speaking with executives and retailers, though, it becomes clear that no one is quite sure exactly how bad the news is and who comes out in better or worse shape. Will these fluctuations level out at a lower exchange rate after the European Central Bank gets involved? Will Richemont absorb some of the additional long-term costs, keeping prices lower for retailers and consumers? Do people buying $250,000 double tourbillon watches even care about an extra 5-7 percent on the price tag? In short, no one quite knows, and it looks as if it could be a while before we get any real answers.

=== Title: Eight Watches You Need to Know About Right Now, From SIHH 2015 - Bloomberg ===

There are literally hundreds of watches unveiled at SIHH in a matter of days. It’s easy to feel like there are too many to sift through, and not all of them are worth paying attention to, either. Here are eight of our favorites that you want to check out before retailers’ waiting lists get too long.
 
With ex Jaeger-LeCoultre CEO Jerome Lambert at the helm, Montblanc has been creating traditionally high-end complications at more affordable prices. Last year there was a steel perpetual calendar for under $13,000 and now we have a true world timer with a day/night map on the dial for under $6,000 in steel. The price point opens this complication up to an entirely new audience. We’ll always applaud that.
 
Usually Greubel Forsey’s watches are all about depth, so we were surprised to see them slimming things down with the 24 Secondes Vision. The tourbillon still needs breathing room, so there’s a sapphire bubble coming out of the caseback; this looks awkward but was actually engineered with the bone structure of the wrist in mind so you don’t even feel it. This watch has all the finishing and know-how of its larger brothers, but in a more discrete package. 
Price upon request, 
Non-round watches have been a big part of Cartier’s collection since the first Santos was made in 1904. The Clé is an entirely new shape that’s tough to describe. It’s sort of tonneau shaped, but with a round dial and a back that curves to fit the wrist snugly. The crown is actually rectangular like an old clock key. In short, it’s awesome, and with an in-house movement and 26 variations in white and rose gold, with and without diamonds, it’s going to make a lot of people happy.
From $19,700, 
 
This is a watch that could easily have slipped into gimmick territory. JLC has outfitted an existing triple calendar with a dial made of a sliver of meteorite taken from a stone in Sweden. Yes, it’s from an actual meteorite. The steel version has a natural-colored dial while the rose gold version is stained slightly darker. Both look great even if you don’t know the astral history, and you’re not suddenly going to become Captain Kirk to your co-workers. 
$12,400 (steel) and $23,900 (rose gold), 
 
Ultra-thin is Piaget’s bread and butter, but the flagship Altiplano line of slim watches has never contained a chronograph. This first attempt is one of those watches that you have to wear to truly understand. The case is insanely thin for a flyback chronograph that also includes a GMT function and the balanced proportions keep it from feeling like a dinner plate. My biggest complaint is that it’s only available in red gold unless you want a diamond bezel. 
$28,000 (rose gold), 
When you mess with a classic, the results are often disastrous. And, if we’re being honest, IWC’s gone that route before. But with the 75th anniversary limited edition of the Portugieser, IWC nailed it. By distilling out the best elements of the 1939 original while adding an updated modern movement, IWC has created a watch that had all the vintage collectors fighting to try it on. You’ll notice it’s also no longer called the Portuguese: it got it’s original name back in addition to the face lift.
$11,500 (steel, 750 pieces) and $22,000 (red gold, 175 pieces), 
Mechanical watches are entirely outdated technology, which is why I love it when a complication is less about utility and more about the romance associated with timekeeping. Days are not truly 24 hours long year round, and an equation of time measures the few minutes plus or minus between the time your watch reads and the actual time based on the Earth’s rotation. By putting it in a simple, understated package, Panerai’s created a (limited edition) thinking man’s sport watch.
$22,800 (steel, 100 pieces), 
This watch has been a long time coming. The hands telescope in and out to always be the same distance from the edge of the oval case, and this mechanism still required perfecting after Parmigiani first announced the model two years ago. It’s ready for customers now, though, and it’s fun to watch it work. Something tells me that if I owned one I might spend more time spinning the hands around the dial than actually using the watch to tell time.
$60,000 (white or rose gold), 
It’s hard to consider this a real “release” since it’s a concept watch not for sale. That said, Audemars Piguet has created a minute repeater that sounds better than any I’ve ever heard before. It’s loud, crisp, and sounds like a musical instrument not a broken alarm clock. When this technology finds its way into actual production pieces, AP is going to blow everyone away. If you’re ever lucky enough to get a chance to see the RD#1 in person, don’t pass it up. And invite me along.

=== Title: It’s Time to Learn About the Wide Variety of Military Watches Worth Collecting - Bloomberg ===

Collectors love military watches. It's as simple as that. Naval dive watches, like the Rolex Submariners used by the British Ministry of Defense and the 
 used by the American Navy, are definitely the most collectable and fetch the highest prices. But they're not the only handsome and valuable military watches out there. Here are three pilot watches in 
 in New York City that are worth a look.
The Breguet Type XX is an anomaly for the brand. High complications and elegant dress watches are what most people expect from Breguet, but in the 1960s it made a few variations on a chronograph for the French military pilots. This one is the 
 ($7,000 to $10,000 estimate), which has a distinctive "big eye" subdial at 3 o'clock to count out the minutes for the chronograph (the 12-hour dials is down at 6 o'clock). The matte black dial has big luminous numbers and hands, plus the 12-hour rotating bezel for timing long flights.
For a slightly simpler chrono, there's 
 ($3,000 to $5,000 estimate) from circa 1960. It has just two resisters, with the minutes counter going up to 30 minutes for the chronograph. The bezel is actually like one you'd see on a dive watch, graduated in minutes with numerals at 15, 30, and 45. The chrono seconds hand has big luminous triangle at the tip and if you look at the bottom of the dial you'll see "A. Cairelli Roma," the boutique in the Eternal City that retailed these watches.
And finally the outlier: the 
 ($2,000 to $3,000 estimate) pilot's watch isn't a chronograph at all and was made for the Czech military in 1935. There's a little red triangle mounted to the round bezel that can rotate and act as a marker for timing out an event and the hands look like something you might see on a World War I trench watch. The cushion-shaped case is anti-magnetic (as noted on the dial) and it's a unique look in the world of military watches. 
All three of these are hitting the auction block at 
, taking place in New York City on December 15.

=== Title: Hands-On With Patek Philippe Ref. 5524G: A Strange Pilot’s Watch - Bloomberg ===

Patek Philippe is known as one of the world's greatest watch brands for a number of reasons. Making pilot's watches isn't one of them.
One of the 
 to come out of this year's 
 was the reference 5524G, also called the 
. First designed to be strapped over flight jackets in the days before digital instruments, pilot's watches are usually large, have high-contrast dials with legible numbers and hands, and place a premium on accurate timekeeping. Patek made a few pilot's watches back during the two world wars but has since stayed out of the aviation realm. This new pilot has little in common with the originals; encouragingly, it shows a willingness on the part of Patek, one of the most tradition-minded brands in watchmaking, to push the envelope a little.
The real question is: How did Patek do?
The 5524 is a strange beast. Its 42-milimeter diameter and bold, luminous hands and numerals speak to legibility and toughness, but then you realize the entire case is made of brushed white gold, not steel. A soft, heavy metal doesn't make a lot of sense for a tool watch. The textured blue dial is absolutely lovely, but the lume on the numbers and hands is a pale green color reminiscent of the paint that has historically been used to poorly restore vintage pilot watches. While it's something that only watch nerds would pick up, it's not a great choice.
Powering the 5524 is Patek's Caliber 324 SC FUS, an automatic movement that has a fully adjustable GMT hand for tracking a second time zone, as well as a date function. The GMT hand can be easily adjusted by using the pushers on the left side of the case, meaning no fiddling with the crown, and the pushers lock with a quarter turn to make the case waterproof. However, since the movement was originally developed for the much smaller 
, there's a massive gold bezel around the movement on the caseback. It's not terrible, but you know the feeling when you use your iPad to run an app sized for the iPhone: It looks kinda cheap. 
The price is a further point of contention. Sure, $47,600 is completely understandable for a white gold Patek Philippe with a dual-time automatic movement inside. But a pilot's watch just doesn't feel like something that should cost almost $50,000. These are meant to be hard-nosed tool watches for daring aviators (or for those of us who like to pretend at our keyboards), not rarified creations for those who wouldn't dare to wear a non-precious metal. Add that relatively few 5524s will be produced—there's not a set number, but we're told distribution will be kept tight—so they're likely to sell for even more than MSRP.
Even with all these contradictions, I'm glad Patek created the 5524. The watch itself may be frustratingly imperfect (I 
 wanted to like it), but the idea behind it is a good one: Patek understands that it needs to look beyond its traditional customers and styles if it's going to survive deep into the 21st century and beyond.
Watches such as this are an overt attempt to court a younger, more casual watch buyer. And while I wouldn't advise those collectors to snatch up the 5524, I'd tell them to keep their eyes on Patek for what comes next. It is likely to be awesome.

=== Title: Out-There Watchmaker MB&F Hits Lower Price Point for Anniversary - Bloomberg ===

To celebrate 10 years of making absolutely crazy watches, niche brand MB&F is releasing Horological Machine X (HMX for short). Instead of making its most complicated watch to date, MB&F went in the opposite direction and made its most affordable watch yet. At $30,000, it's a fitting birthday present for the world's devotees of haute horology.
The HMX looks like something from the future, but reading the time is extremely easy. There are two rotating discs, one for the hours that jumps instantaneously and another that spins slowly to show the minutes. They are horizontal, but a pair of lenses projects them onto the vertical plane, and you just read the time as on a digital clock. The color accents come in four different colors, blue, red, green, and black, to suit different tastes.
If you're an MB&F fan, you've probably already noticed that the HMX looks a little familiar. It closely resembles the 
, nicknamed On The Road—both are inspired by 1970s wedge cars. The HMX is a little more rounded and has that domed crystal on top instead of the fins on the HM5. But while the inspiration is the same, the mechanics and construction are radically different. 
The movement's engine styling is more than just decoration; those little caps on the engine block bridges can be removed by a watchmaker, allowing him to oil and lubricate the bearings that hold the time discs. Underneath is a full, disc-shaped rotor made from 22-karat red gold that winds the watch. To optimize value, MB&F chose to use a gear train from movement maker Sellita to power the two-disc module, instead of developing something new entirely in house. Snobs might scoff, but it's a conscious decision and for the right reason—to keep price down and the watch within reach for more people. 
Holding all this is the steel and titanium case, with the dramatically curved sapphire lens on top. This lets you admire the movement, but more importantly, it's critical to allowing in enough light to make the projections of the time discs visible, even in dim rooms. The watch isn't small, but the materials keep it lightweight and wearable.
For a brand known as a boundary-pusher to rein things in and do something restrained and customer-focused like this for its anniversary is refreshing. MB&F could easily have made a handful of million-dollar pieces, with high margins, and sold every single one of them. But not only is this a treat for dedicated collectors; it also offers a way into the brand's history for those who have been watching from the sidelines for the past decade. I like it.
The HMX is limited to 20 numbered pieces in each of the four colors (for a total of 80, a high number for MB&F), all priced at $30,000. 

=== Title: Ringo Starr’s Patek Philippe Fetches Almost $180,000 at California Auction - Bloomberg ===

On Thursday, Los Angeles-based Julien’s Auctions hosted a 1,367-lot sale dedicated to the property of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and actress Barbara Bach. Buried in the couple’s possessions, among everything from Lichtenstein prints to old scarves and Adidas sneakers, was Lot 167, a gold Patek Philippe wristwatch that fetched $179,200.
Forget the connection to Ringo—
. The ref. 3448 was the first automatic perpetual calendar made by Patek, and only 586 were produced. Julien’s listed the watch with a $40,000 starting bid and an estimate of $80,000 to $100,000, which is significantly less than you’d expect for a basic 3448. For comparison, one 
 at Christie’s for $136,300, though that watch appears to have been in better condition than this one. Ringo’s was clearly worn and isn’t pristine, but it’s by no means trashed or damaged. The watch is on a worn-in strap from famous London jeweler Asprey, indicating he may have purchased it there to begin with, adding value for collectors.
A closing bid of nearly $180,000 (about 30 percent higher than the 2012 example) is a strong result for this watch, if not a gobsmacking one. Yes, crazed Beatles fans dueling with their auction paddles could easily have driven the price much higher, but those kinds of results only distort the market. The price paid for this watch would be high without its provenance, but it seems like a reasonable premium (if one can even try to assess the value of such things).
Looking at other celebrity watches for a sense of scale, an actual 
 drew $365,000 last month at Phillips, and in 2012 a 
 sold for almost $800,000, under two very different sets of conditions. Ringo’s Patek sits almost halfway between the two: The Bond watch doesn’t function and is just a movie prop at this point, but it was still sold at a dedicated watch auction, while the McQueen Monaco is a functioning timekeeper sold at a thematic auction of Hollywood memorabilia.
There’s another, even more desirable Beatles watch out there somewhere, too. John Lennon is known to have worn a yellow gold ref. 2499, which is a perpetual calendar chronograph (to one-up Ringo’s “basic” perpetual calendar). The watch is clearly visible in multiple photographs of Lennon, but its whereabouts today are entirely unknown. Considering a yellow gold 2499 
 at Sotheby’s in May 2015, Lennon’s watch could easily achieve something astronomical.

=== Title: Chiltern Firehouse Chef Wants to Crowdfund New London Restaurant - Bloomberg ===

A Michelin star-winning chef wants to create a world-class restaurant on the banks of London’s River Thames. So far, so 2015. The difference this time is that he’s offering diners at his existing restaurants the chance to invest in the new venture via a crowdfunding website.

=== Title: Monday Morning Find: A Rare Naval Dive Watch With Big Deal History - Bloomberg ===

Watch collectors love dive watches. They just do. Rare dive watches are even more appealing. This Fifty Fathoms is a rare creation from a Swiss factory for a century-old American watchmaker, and you can count the number made on one hand.
The history of Waltham Watch is confusing. The company was founded in 1850 under a different name in Massachusetts, then a big watchmaking and clockmaking hub. The name changed a few times over the years as the company continued to make nice, affordable watches and clocks on U.S. soil. After declaring bankruptcy in 1949, the company restructured. In 1954, it opened a Swiss subsidiary that teamed with manufacturer Blancpain to make watches there. The entire venture went belly-up in 1957, and the brand sat mostly dormant until some Swiss investors launched a brand under the old name in 2014. I know, it's a mess.
The watch here was made by Blancpain under the Waltham name in 1957, the company's final year in business. The design is almost identical to that of Blancpain's own Fifty Fathoms dive watches, but it has a large Waltham logo on the dial, caseback, and movement. It's a slightly different situation than the one that produced 
 back in the 1930s, but it follows a similar principle.
The Fifty Fathoms watches were were first produced in 1953 and were made for various military dive units. While everyone knows about the Rolex Submariner, the Fifty Fathoms was actually the first watch to have an external rotating bezel that could be used to time dives with the 60-minute markers. The oversized bezel, large 41mm case, and luminous markers present here are all hallmarks of the style.
Beyond the dial signature, some further aspects make this Waltham unique. Instead of the combination of bar- and dot-shaped luminous markers, this watch has 3-6-9-12 numerals, in addition to some bars—all of which are intact. (As are the hands, also filled with glowing material.) 
If you pop off the Waltham-signed waterproof caseback, you'll see the 1361N movement. It has 17 jewels and is automatically wound with the large, heavy rotor. Even though the movements came from Blancpain workshops, they were signed "Waltham," just like the rest of the components. The movement is shielded with shock protectors and an antimagnetic cage to make it battle-ready.
Original Fifty Fathoms are collectable for a number of reasons. The first is that they're military watches—much more accessibly priced military watches than the 
. The second is that they were made in a large number of tiny variations, meaning that there are only a handful of models of any given configuration. There are variations in dials, bezels, and even tiny caseback markings. The Waltham Fifty Fathoms are particularly rare, and the seller of this watch claims that only five are known to exist with this dial. That sounds about right to me, though there's no way to know for sure.

=== Title: Ressence Type 3 Limited Edition: A Wild, Oil-Filled Watch Only for the U.S. - Bloomberg ===

The Ressence Type 3 is a watch made for mad scientists.
Or maybe it's for those who can't decide whether they're more excited about the latest smartphone or a retro steam engine. It uses magnets to rotate discs in an oil-filled chamber—yes, you read that right—to indicate the time, date, day of the week, and even the internal temperature of the watch itself. (You read that last bit right, too.)
Unlike the 
, which is meant to look raw and unfinished, the Type 3 is all about polish. That oil (technically a naphtha-type liquid hydrocarbon) serves an important purpose: By sitting between the rotating dial discs and the domed crystal, it acts like a lens, projecting the markings and giving the illusion that they're painted right on its surface. Unless you really squint, you can't even see the edges of the various black discs, completing the effect.
This made the Type 3 the winner of the first "Best Horological Revelation" award at the 2013 
, given to the top creation from a young watchmaker. 
Utilizing the edges of the larger 44mm size, the Type 3 has a date ring around the edge of the dial that rotates, lining up the current date with the blue arrow at the bottom. There's also a 
 gauge that tracks the internal temperature, indicating whether the watch is too hot or cold, both of which negatively affect the oil inside. 
This engineering is right in line with the most currently available Type 3 around the world—so what makes this one unique for the U.S. market?
Of its few limited-edition traits, most significantly it's the first Ressence to feature a black case. Because of the large domes on the front and back, you can see only a sliver of matte black titanium between the two as well as the integrated lugs holding the strap.
There is also a new red, white, and blue color scheme subtle enough that people probably won't pick up on it unless you tell them. The icy blue is really incredible and very easy to read against the inky black background.
From top to bottom, the Type 3 is a wild watch.
The movement is totally sealed in the bottom dome to protect it from the liquid that fills the top portion. To move the discs, magnets mounted on gears exert their force through the thin titanium center section, never actually touching the components above. Also, you'll notice there's no crown or stem of any kind; to set the watch, you rotate the entire back dome. There's even a gravity-activated clutch that allows the rotation to set different functions when the watch is upright vs. upside down. Like I said, wild.
If this bizarre, beautiful feat of engineering excites you, act fast—the six special-edition pieces are pretty much all spoken for, even with a $42,200 price tag. Contact your favorite 
 to test your luck.

=== Title: Ressence Type 1 Genesis Watch Is Meant to Look Like a Prototype - Bloomberg ===

It's no secret that I'm a big fan of Belgian watchmaker Ressence and its dedication to slick engineering and creativity, evident in signature nested dials. (Heck, I lobbied to include the Type 1 in our 
.) It's one of the few modern brands doing something truly innovative and unique with horology—something that could never have been done in the past. 
To celebrate its fifth anniversary, 
 has created a special edition of its signature product: the Type 1 Genesis.
Founder Benoît Mintiens's concept was to look back to the very first prototypes for inspiration, creating a Type 1 with parts as fresh as possible off the assembly line. No hand-finishing, no SuperLuminova filling in the numerals, no polished edges. It's meant to invoke the earliest successful Ressence experiments. Hence, the name Genesis.
In case you've forgotten how to read a Ressence, it's pretty straightforward. The long-hand shape marker on the main circular plate points to the minutes around the edge of the dial. As it rotates, so do the three disks inside. The disc marked 1-12 shows the hour, the disc with 12 indices shows seconds, and the disc with seven indices shows the days of the week. (Hollow for weekdays and double-engraved for weekends.)
It seems complicated. But after you wear one for a day or two, the process becomes as intuitive as reading a normal watch face. And seeing the entire watch face make a full rotation every hour never gets old.
Technically, the Type 1 Genesis is exactly the same as the standard Type 1 variations; it's the finishing that's different. While the Type 1 typically features a highly polished one-piece titanium case, the Genesis's case is totally matte and still shows the marks from the milling machine. The nickel silver dial has been sandblasted to a uniform finish and the hand-shaped markers galvanized for legibility, but the rest has been left alone. Without the glowing SuperLuminova filling them up, the numerals and markers offer incredible visual depth that gives the dial a notably different look from other models. Even the Barenia leather strap is untreated, so it will gather patina with age. 
As so many brands are pushing to "add value" through 
, 
, and 
 (not always a bad thing), it's refreshing to see a brand take a special occasion as an opportunity to highlight the beauty of the engineering itself. The Genesis reminds the wearer that a mechanical watch is a piece of industrial artwork that is inextricably tied to the machines and minds that created it.
Let's just say I haven't wanted a watch this badly in a long time.

=== Title: SIHH: The Most Luxurious Trade Show You’ve Never Heard Of - Bloomberg ===

With all the hand-wringing inspired by the recent economic news coming out of Switzerland, it’s easy to forget that the country’s watchmakers are still hard at work. This week Geneva plays host to the 25th annual 
, the first major event of the year for the wristwatch industry. It’s the most luxurious trade show you’ve never heard of. 
Only 16 brands show at the invitation-only event, the 13 owned by luxury conglomerate 
 and three high-end independent brands that opt for the gentility of SIHH over the more democratic chaos of the more popular Baselworld show that takes place each March. While there are more accessible watches by such brands as  
 and 
, SIHH is also where the likes of 
 and 
 show off their most insane creations.
Unlike most trade shows, the retailers, journalists, and collectors who attend are not relegated to devouring sandwiches on a few free square feet of floor space. You want fois gras or sushi for lunch? No problem. You’d prefer truffle risotto and a glass of champagne? It’s on the house. The swag on offer is much more likely to be a tablet than a tote bag. (Editor's note: Bloomberg doesn't accept swag.) It’s nothing short of a shock and awe campaign to make sure that when you think of luxury, it’s these brands that come to mind.

=== Title: OneOf Accuracy Tells You Exactly When to Get Your Fancy Watch Serviced - Bloomberg ===

Even for the most knowledgable watch collectors, there's an element of uncertainty as to what's going on inside the machine on your wrist moment to moment. The OneOf Accuracy is a gadget that aims to fix that. Think of it as a well-designed check engine light for that Patek you love so much.
 itself is a 3.75 inch square made of dark brushed metal with a simple headphone cord coming out of it. Simple enough. You just plug it into your iPhone/iPad/iPod touch (sorry Android fans) and the app lets you control everything through an extremely clean interface. The technology itself seems rather simple, but tolerances are so low that everything must be extremely precise or the whole thing becomes useless. Here's what it does:
There is a vibration sensor under the metal plate that picks up on the movements of a watch's balance wheel. As it beats away, the sensor picks up the sound and feeds the data through the headphone port to the app on your phone. A proprietary combination of hardware and software means the Accuracy can measure your watch's rate within +/-0.1 second per day. This means it can tell you how, well, 
your timepiece is and will continue to be. If there's something going on with the movement—if it's off beat or running too slow or too fast—this is how you'll know.
The company making the Accuracy has been making tools for professional watchmakers and brands' manufacturing facilities for years. This is their first consumer-facing product, but it's coming from experts with experience.
The Accuracy is a beautiful little object and the app is very well designed. It looks perfectly at home on Apple's hardware. I tested one out for a few days and was impressed with the results. You put your watch on the pad, hit a button, and in a few seconds you get a live readout of the balance wheel's activity, the frequency, the amplitude, the average variation, and the beat error. You can set up profiles for each of your watches and track them over time too, which would be nice for monitoring performance long term. The only hiccup I found was that some watches with metal bracelets needed to be propped at an angle on the surface, otherwise the bracelet interfered with the sensor.
While the OneOf Accuracy isn't a necessity by any means, there are plenty of reasons that it's a smart thing for a collector to have around. A big question, especially with vintage watches, is when to have them serviced. Getting your watch fixed up can be expensive (plus it's off somewhere other than your wrist for weeks, months, or more) but if you let all the lubrication dry out or misaligned gears grind against each other, you can do serious long term damage to your watch. The Accuracy is a good way to keep tabs on your collection at home, meaning you know when you 
 to visit a watchmaker, rather than having to guess.
Service utility aside, the Accuracy is a good tool for learning more about mechanical watchmaking and a lot of hobbyist collectors will just find it downright fun to use. Watch collectors tend to be, ahem, obsessive people and this is yet another way to spend time staring at tiny mechanical marvels and fixating on data.
The OneOf Accuracy is $578 and can be ordered through

=== Title: How Daniel Wellington Made a $200 Million Business Out of Cheap Watches - Bloomberg ===

It began, unlike many watches, with the strap. In 2006, Filip Tysander was backpacking through Australia when he met a wanderer named Daniel Wellington. This was back before everybody had a smartphone, when people still wore a watch to tell time. Wellington’s stood out for its bracelet—a minimalist black-and-gray nylon band, known as a NATO strap, securing a chunky Rolex Submariner to his wrist. After a few more chance encounters with Wellington between Melbourne and Cairns, Tysander became obsessed with the military-inflected accessory. So much so that he went home to Uppsala, Sweden, and built a whole company on the idea, naming it after the stranger who inspired him.
, or DW as the company is often abbreviated, makes watches that are both instantly recognizable and so generic they verge on invisible. They come with polished-steel or rose-gold-colored cases, in five sizes from a diminutive 26-millimeter to a medium-large 40mm. The dials are all white, with slim lines marking each hour and hands just wide enough to be legible. The only thing that noticeably sets DWs apart from each other is the strap, which comes in a half-dozen colorful nylons and a few leather options, none flashy enough to mar the luxurious look. With a watch, you often pay extra for minimalism—think A. Lange & Söhne or Piaget—but DWs are cheap, running from $149 to $299.
“Our watches are inspired by the upper echelons of the watch world but at a very accessible price point,” says Frans Sjo, business manager for the U.S. “It’s fair to say that we want everyone to be able to own a Daniel Wellington.” Four years ago, Tysander invested $15,000 to start the company. In 2014 it sold more than a million timepieces and took in $70 million. This year, Tysander projects $220 million in revenue. By comparison, Rolex, which sells $5,000-plus watches, and Tag Heuer, which focuses on $1,000 ones, consider it a good year if they sell a million units.
Which means that, right now at least, it’s good business to sell very expensive watches—or very cheap ones. DW competes with countless other brands in the $100 to $500 sector, including the Bauhaus-style Mondaine and the more military-looking Tsovet. But, in the same way that brightly colored plastic Swatches dominated the 1980s and utilitarian Fossils took off in the ’90s, Daniel Wellingtons own the current decade. “Often a designer watch whose core reason to exist is that it is fashionable this season is probably no longer viable next season,” says Steve Bock, former president of Fossil and current president of Bedrock Manufacturing, the parent company of Shinola watches.
Beyond getting the styling right, Tysander picked a good moment to build a watch brand. After dipping during the financial crisis, the industry has grown every year since. About 40 million analog quartz watches were sold in 2014 in the U.S. alone, up from about 33 million in 2009, according to market researcher Euromonitor. Corresponding revenue rose by an even larger rate, jumping from $3.7 billon to $5 billion. And even though the Apple Watch—which sold 1.5 million timepieces in only a week—might have looked like a deadly threat to traditional watchmakers such as Daniel Wellington, sales have since dropped as much as 90 percent, says a recent report by Slice Intelligence, an analytics firm in Palo Alto. Two-thirds of the Apple Watches sold were the cheaper $349 Sport model.
When Tysander, 30, started his company in 2009, he also was running an online necktie store with his brother and producing a line of plastic Rolex look-alikes. The Chinese factory he worked with on the watches happened to also make nylon bands, so he began thinking about what kind of face might look handsome paired with them. “I designed a thinner case and added some color to go with the preppy trend going on at the time,” he says. The first Daniel Wellington was 40mm and rose-gold, and it came with one of four bright nylon straps.
In person, Tysander bears a striking resemblance to the watches he’s created. He’s slim, with that particular color of shockingly blond hair that seems to exist only in Sweden. On the day we met, he was in a streamlined navy suit. “One of the biggest challenges in the beginning was that it was just me, no co-founders,” he says. At first, he recruited classmates from Uppsala University to help. Now his team has more than 100 people throughout five offices, in Los Angeles, New York, Stockholm, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen, China. Only recently has he started adding senior staff, including a chief executive officer, Roger Kylberg, who used to run a popular Swedish children’s clothing brand.
Although DW bills itself as a Swedish company, the watches are manufactured in China, which is how the company keeps prices so low. The internal quartz movements—a battery and vibrating crystal to keep the time, essentially—come from Miyota, a Japanese supplier popular with lower-price brands, because their products are reliable and they always have a massive inventory. The rest of the components are made and assembled in Shenzhen, a manufacturing hub.
The distribution is similarly international. At first, Tysander began selling the watch online in Sweden and through local storefronts. A year later he came to New York to find American partners, and now the watches are carried in major department stores such as Bloomingdale’s and Nordstrom, as well as at niche fashion boutiques including Haberdash in Chicago and Lizard Lounge in Portland, Ore. Soon after, the DW team began attending Baselworld, the industry’s largest trade show, held each spring in Switzerland. Unlike other brands that aim to stay exclusive by not selling to any old shop, DW will distribute to most retailers that want its product. There are now more than 5,800 partners worldwide, in places as far-flung as Kazakhstan, the Faroe Islands, and Andorra. Tysander says he wants to expand into places such as Africa that are underserved by the watch market.
The company also has a habit of giving its product away for free, specifically to social-media stars and prominent personalities. Tysander refuses to pay for traditional advertising, instead working with thousands of bloggers, celebrities, and other “influencers” worldwide. One of them, Blake Scott, 27, has been collaborating with Daniel Wellington for a little more than a year, sharing the watches with his 318,000 Instagram followers. “I first found out about Daniel Wellington via Instagram: Everyone outside the States was wearing one, and it seemed so cool,” he says. Soon after, someone from the brand reached out and said he wanted to give Scott a couple of watches to post on his feed. Eventually he negotiated a deal with the company, which paid a few hundred dollars for a multiweek campaign.
By being so blatant on social media, Daniel Wellington’s Instagram account has gained more than a million followers, almost quadruple that of competitors MVMT (238,000) and Fossil (236,000). Traditionally, watch brands have avoided using social media, so Daniel Wellington has filled the void for online watch content.
But a plain watch gets boring after a while. So, in April, Tysander announced Daniel Wellington’s latest style, the Dapper, its most complicated watch yet. And, at $299, its most expensive. It has black Roman numerals, instead of the typical stick markers, and a date window, a first for the brand. Instead of gold, the hands gleam metallic blue. And, in the gravest departure yet, the company suggests wearing it not with a NATO strap but a more sophisticated leather band.

=== Title: What Is a Chronometer? A Guide to These Top-Notch Watches - Bloomberg ===

The watch world is full of jargon that's tough to understand. Chronometer might sound like a mouthful, but it's just a fancy word for "really, really precise watch."
The word chronometer goes back to the early eighteenth century, when an English clockmaker called Jeremy Thacker invented a vacuum-sealed clock. Without air resistance, it was extremely accurate; Thacker dubbed his creation a chronometer. The name was later used a few decades later to describe marine chronometers—clocks suspended in gyroscopic boxes that helped ships determine longitude and traverse the world's oceans. Today you can wear their precision-crazed successors on your wrist.
As with most things in the Swiss watch industry, the term "chronometer" is closely guarded. A watch must pass through the Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres (
) in order to carry the term on its dial. The COSC, a testing institute, subjects a watch's movement to a multi-day examination that places it in five different orientations and three different temperatures to gauge its precision amid varied conditions. The final result must be a daily variation no more than -4 or +6 seconds per day for a mechanical movement. (There are standards for battery-powered watches, too, though very few brands produce them.) Only 3 percent of watches produced in Switzerland make their way through COSC's certification process; some equally precise watches are not submitted for testing.
A lot of factors can contribute to a watch making it through COSC's grueling tests (or failing, for that matter), but two qualities must be present for a watchmaker's work to qualify as a chronometer: good materials and high quality control. Better metal alloys and such materials as silicium are less susceptible to expanding and contracting when the temperature changes. Nor are they as easily degraded by friction. When you're relying on a steadily beating spring and some gears to keep time, this is paramount. And even if you have the best raw components, they need to be assembled properly to function at their peak. Pinions need to be well-oiled, gears precisely cut, and everything locked together nicely and tightly.
Whether you're new to chronometers or have a collection of always-on-time watches, here are a few to look out for.
You don't have to spend a small fortune to get something mechanically reliable. Tissot makes a few chronometers with three-figure price tags, but you should spend just a little more to spring for the 
. It has a souped-up automatic movement that won a national chronometer competition when it was first released in 2012, beating out watches that cost more than 10 times as much. 
Just as marine chronometers pushed exploration by ship, accurate pocket watches made it possible to standardize time across the U.S. railroad system. Ball pioneered these pocket watches back in the 1800s and is still making wristwatches in the original style. The 
 has an enamel dial and bright luminous markers that are actually tiny, gas-filled tubes for maximum glow. 
The British brand might not be subject to the Swiss chronometer regulations (nor do most of their watches say chronometer on the dial), but almost every watch in its lineup is COSC-certified. The 
 is an evolution of Bremont's signature watch, inspired by a famous fighter-jet ejection seat. It adds a second time zone hand to the mix, while still being easy to read—and nearly indestructible. 
Omega's upping the ante with the 
, introducing an even more stringent grade of certification, the Master Chronometer. Not only does this watch go through the usual temperature and movement tests, but it is tested in strong magnetic fields—something that's increasingly practical because everything, from your cell phone to your refrigerator, contains magnets these days. Way to ruin it for everyone else, Omega. 

=== Title: Rolex’s “Big Egg” Is a Quirky Watch From the 1950s: Monday Morning Find - Bloomberg ===

Even if you're a beginning collector, you've no doubt heard about the more common Rolex models such as the Submariner and the Daytona. What you might not know about is the Ovettone.
The term is actually a nickname, coming from the Italian for "big egg," that describes a broad category of oversized watches with the bubble-shaped casebacks used in the 1940s and '50s. These casebacks screw into the rest of the Oyster case, making the watches waterproof, but the winding rotor for the movement sticks up too high to make the back sit flush. Hence the signature egg-shaped bubble.
This Ovettone dates to the mid 1950s and looks the part. The dial has faded from what was once probably a bright white to a parchment color, and the tone is even across the entire dial. The black printing is clean and easy to read but has lost the inkiness it probably had fresh out of the box. All these things are good: they indicate that the piece is original and hasn't been retouched at all.
The Rolex coronet at 12 o'clock is a shorter crown than what you're used to seeing on later models, and the date window at 3 o'clock doesn't have the magnifying cyclops in the crystal above. (That wouldn't be invented for a few additional years). 
The two-tone gold and steel construction furthers the period effect of this Rolex. The main case is all steel, but both the crown and the textured bezel are yellow gold. That slight pinkish hue is due to age. The coolest part is the way the two-tone bracelet is executed: This style of bracelet is called a "rivet" bracelet by collectors because the folded links have end pieces and visible pins holding everything in place. Not only are the center links gold, but the end caps on the sides of the bracelet are, too. 
If the world of collecting 
 is all about finding old, rugged tools and projecting a sort of McQueen-esque cool, collecting Ovettone and Bubble Backs (the Ovettone's smaller cousin) is about preserving relics of the early days of wristwatches with a certain laid-back insouciance. Think 1970s Ferraris vs. 1950s Jaguars. Also, because these watches are generally smaller in size and less well known than their popular sporty cousins, you can get a great watch for a lot less. 
This Rolex Ovettone is available from 
 and €6,500 ($7,100).

=== Title: Five Watches to Buy Instead of That $10,000 Apple Watch Hybrid - Bloomberg ===

Earlier this week, new watch brand 
 burst on the scene by unleashing the Pinnacle into the annals of infamy. It's a mechanical watch that has an Apple Watch integrated into the metal bracelet. It costs almost $10,000 in stainless steel and more than $110,000 in 18K gold, both of which sit squarely in "
" territory. 
Here are five watches that sell for less and will get you a lot more credibility along the way.
The 
 ($9,250) is an exercise in what Jaeger-LeCoultre does best: elegant engineering. It's slim at only 9.9mm thick (with a 4.9mm movement under the dial), and the aesthetics are classic and understated. The date display at 6 o'clock also houses a moon-phase complication, and the faceted hour markers make it easy to read in any light. The sunburst black dial is new for this year, but the traditional silver is a great standby.
 
Just because you don't have an Apple Watch jerry-rigged to your bracelet doesn't mean you need to go for a totally under-the-radar specimen. This 
 ($7,000) has an all-steel case and bracelet but with gold accents in the bezel and on the dial for a mellow two-tone execution. The best part: The Spring Drive movement is a hybrid electric/mechanical system that you can actually be proud of.
 
As you'd expect from Rolex, the 
 ($5,700) is all about getting the details right. The case is slimmer than most Rolexes and a size that transitions between casual and dressed-up easily. You'd be hard-pressed to find a watch that is a better daily driver. The dials come in a variety of color combinations that are more adventurous than the Swiss stalwart usually opts for, including gray and light blue, brushed blue and neon green, and even plum and raspberry.
 
The 
 ($8,000) has a 44mm case with a strong profile, but it's made of titanium so you can actually lift your wrist. Inside is a fully in-house P.9000 automatic movement, giving you three days of power reserve. It's a beefy watch perfect for this time of year. Also, Panerai opened an 
 just a few weeks ago, so getting your hands on one is a piece of cake.
 
Vintage-inspired watches are only getting more popular, and the 
 ($4,500) is a great example of why. The updated 45mm case size is big, even for today, but the styling is all reminiscent of very early wristwatches worn by soldiers in the trenches during World War I. The dial is inky black with gilt accents and the numerals are exposed metal, not painted, adding another textural dimension. The thin lugs hold a black alligator strap, making the otherwise sporty watch feel a little buttoned up.
 
All right, for a great solid gold watch, reach for this 
 ($34,900) instead of the Sunrise Pinnacle. Please. The unique case shape curves to the wrist, and the crown is reminiscent of a tiny winding key. And if you just have to have some tech, too, you can pick up the watch and a 
 for just a few thousand dollars more than the Sunrise Pinnacle alone.

=== Title: First Jaeger-LeCoultre Watch at Auction: Perpetual Calendar, 1937 - Bloomberg ===

Jaeger-LeCoultre is a key member of the pantheon of modern watchmakers, producing a healthy mix of easy to wear pieces, high complications, and gem-set watches, almost entirely in-house. This tiny perpetual calendar may be the first watch it ever made.
Antoine LeCoultre opened his eponymous watch manufacture in 1833 in the Swiss village of Le Sentier, itself founded by a member of the LeCoultre family in the 15th century. French watchmaker Edmond Jaeger didn't enter the picture until the turn of the 20th century, when he began licensing his designs for ultra-thin movements and for the legendary 
 to LeCoultre. Eventually it made sense for the two to join forces, and Jaeger-LeCoultre was born in 1937.
In the company's official history, a footnote mentions a unique watch made around 1937 to celebrate the merger. All we know for sure is that it was a piece-unique rectangular calendar watch. When the perpetual calendar watch now being offered showed up at the Fellows auction house in London, the specialist popped open the caseback and realized that it was probably the historic watch.
First things first: There is no way to prove that this is the watch, unless Jaeger-LeCoultre officially confirms it. The company will have kept the original watch's movement and case numbers in its archive, along with notes on the watch's appearance and features. While the brand has not commented on this watch's history, it has confirmed that it is genuinely unique and in proper order. The watch comes with an official certificate (an "archive extract" in watch parlance) from Jaeger-LeCoultre.
The watch itself is small, solid gold. It has a rectangular shape with an arched crystal over the top. Packed onto the dial are day-of-the-week, date, and month indicators, in addition to the large seconds dial with the moonphase tucked in the middle. No brand name is marked; only the words "perpetual calendar" curve across the top. On removing the caseback, you see the lozenge-shaped movement (based on the movement in the original Reverso) engraved with the bold Jaeger-LeCoultre signature.
During the period leading to World War II, almost no one was making perpetual calendar watches. There are a handful from that era, from a few brands such as Breguet and Patek Philippe, but they are exceedingly rare.
Then comes the strange complication name on the dial—that it's in English indicates that this was probably for the UK or U.S. markets—and the name of the newly formed brand hidden on the movement. Whether or not this is the merger watch, it's a special watch.
You're probably wondering at this point why Jaeger-LeCoultre confirms that this is watch is real and unique but won't confirm or deny that it's the special 1937 piece. The answer is simple: The company probably wants this important piece of Jaeger-LeCoultre history. If it hopes to acquire the watch for the company museum, it would be a bad idea to tell the world of its value before the bidding is resolved. Whatever the truth, I'd wager we'll find out after the hammer falls.
This unique Jaeger-LeCoultre perpetual calendar, possibly of historic import, is 
 in Fellows's Dec. 1 sale in London. It carries an estimate of £15,000 to £20,000 (approximately $22,850 to $30,465). 

=== Title: Fortnum & Mason’s New Restaurant: Snails, Style and Inexpensive Wines - Bloomberg ===

Some new restaurants scream for attention, throwing celebrity parties and gaining publicity more for their diners than their dinners.
And then there is 
, which opened quietly in October 
, which survived for 60 years at the back of 
. This new brasserie is clubby and, while it is beautiful, it is understated. The focus is on the food and wine, and the culture is of hospitality, not bling.
It already feels like a classic, within weeks of opening. I like it so much, I keep going back, if only for a drink. Louis Roederer Brut Champagne is £12 ($18) a glass and three bottles (including Veuve Fourny & Fils Blanc de Blanc) are priced below £50. But it is the food that, rightly, is the star.
The menu is accessible and need not be too expensive if you are on a budget. If you are, I would recommend against the caviar trolley, served tableside with scrambled eggs and baked new potatoes. I prefer to start with the oysters while deciding on a starter, which is quite difficult as there are three I want every time.
First up is Welsh rarebit (£9.50), which has been on the menu at Fortnum since 1926. It gives you a smack of mustard heat burning behind the sharpness of the cheese. And then there are the snails, served in shells filled with gorgonzola and garlic butter (£9). These leave a trail of fatty flavors as they slip down. But the star is a dish of grilled bones with Parmesan and parsley salt. If the marrow were any richer, it could run for president.
Not everything on the menu is cheesy, of course. There's a deeply flavoured game consommé with pearl barley, while a half Dorset blue lobster with Russian salad, which weighs in at £19.25.
The starters are more interesting than the mains, which include a flavorful Glenarm Estate rib steak with Café de Paris butter (£33.50) and more modestly priced options such as calves' liver with bubble & squeak (£16.25). Chef Lee Streeton does the business: when it comes to brasserie fare, familiarity breeds content and comfort engenders joy. A little experimentation is fine but too much is too much.
It's with the desserts that the pleasure principle lets rip, particularly with the Floats, which reference the restaurant's past.  (The Fountain was home to the first soda fountain in the U.K.) Take one single option: Strawberry, Neroli & Orange Blossom Syrup, Cognac, Soda, Peanut Butter Ice Cream (£12.50) . Who knew such disparate elements would get along so well? This is not one big hit of sugar. The sweetness is under control and there are layers of flavor.
I could happily spend an afternoon devouring the Mexicana coupe (tangerine ice cream with pineapple) or the Victoria (fruits soaked in Champagne with strawberry & pistachio ice cream).
But I wouldn't want to ignore the wine list. It is both adventurous (the first region listed is Herefordshire before Burgundy) and inexpensive (many bottles are priced much lower than you would pay elsewhere). About 20 wines are available by the glass and the carafe. Or you might like to jump straight to a bargain Pinot Noir (Domaine Drouhin, Dundee Hills, Oregon 2013) at £40.
45 Jermyn St. isn't pushing any boundaries. It's a bit like The Ivy and there are elements of Le Caprice. It is open all day, so it's a possible alternative to the Wolseley for breakfast. It is not over-ambitious. But what it does it does well. It's one of the best new London restaurants of 2015.

=== Title: What It Took to Make the Most Complicated Watch Ever - Bloomberg ===

A few weeks ago, Vacheron Constantin announced that it had made the 
 ever. When the massive pocket watch came to the United States, we sat down with Dominique Bernaz, director of Vacheron's bespoke watch department, to find out just what went into turning an idea into a watch. 
All in all, it took eight years for Vacheron to create the reference 57260, named for the watch's 57 complications and the company's 260th anniversary. It is nicknamed the Tivoli, which is much less of a mouthful. For a full list of the 57, along with an explanation of what they do and how they work, check out 
 from when the watch was first unveiled.
Eight years ago, a collector approached Vacheron, asking for a special pocket watch. The collector didn't start by asking for the most complicated watch in the world. He asked for a particular set of complications; at some point, the design process embraced the idea of adding a Hebrew perpetual calendar to the Gregorian calendar. This sent the watch over the line, earning it the crown of complexity.
Who is the mysterious collector? We don't know. Vacheron will not release his name, though it always refers to the collector as "he" or "him." Bernaz told us only that "he" is one of the top pocket watch collectors in the world, as well as a long time Vacheron Constantin client. An additional clue is that the star chart on the watch is calibrated to a particular location; the night sky that it shows looks a lot like what you see over or near New York.
Nor will Vacheron Constantin reveal how much this man paid for the Tivoli. As you might expect, an eight-year project involving three watchmakers and a lot of research and development doesn't come cheap. Bernaz said rumors circulating online that put the price between $8 million and $20 million are accurate. This is significantly more than the $5 million figure that was rumored when the watch was released. 
This price probably earns the Tivoli a lesser crown as the second-most-expensive watch ever sold. The most expensive watch ever sold is the Henry Graves Jr. Supercomplication, which
 last year at a Sotheby's auction in Geneva, smashing the $11 million record the Supercomplication set when it was sold in 1999. That watch was the most complicated watch ever made when Graves took delivery in 1933.

=== Title: This Heuer Watch Is a Rare Remnant From the Pre-TAG Era - Bloomberg ===

It was just a week ago that TAG Heuer unveiled 
, the first smartwatch from a Swiss luxury watchmaker. That could very well end up being the future (or at least part of it) for TAG Heuer, but if we dig back into the pre-TAG, pre-battery past of the Heuer brand, beauties like this are waiting.
The Autavia is one of the best-known watches from racing watch maker Heuer, from well before it was acquired by industrial manufacturer TAG in 1985. It was one of the first automatic chronographs in the early 1970s, and via 
 in 1972 it is sometimes credited with saving Heuer from bankruptcy. It's usually these later Autavias that people think of, with tachymeter (speed measuring) bezels and barrel-shaped cases.
This earlier 1967 Autavia is from the second major production series (called "second execution" by collectors) of the line, and it has a few distinguishing characteristics. First is the case. It's round, with the long twisted lugs found on a lot of watchcases from this era, since most were produced by the same few suppliers. It's just under 40mm across, which would have been very big for the era; today it wears a lot like a modern watch. Instead of the tachy bezel of later models, this has a dive-style bezel, graduated to 60 minutes. The dial is extremely open, with a lot of matte black space between the silver stick markers and white subdials: Below the Autavia and Heuer signatures, the only branding is a tiny "Swiss" at 6 o'clock.
The little details on this watch are all right, too. The edge of the bezel and the contours of the lugs haven't been overpolished, so you can still see the original shape and textures. The luminous dots on the dial and the luminous paint filling in the sharp hands have faded to a rich orange color, exactly what you want on this watch. Turning the Autavia over, you can still see the caseback engraving looks just like it did when the watch was new. This is a good sign the watch has been properly cared for, as this is some of the first stuff to go if a watch isn't handled right. Inside is a Valjoux 92 movement, which is manually wound and operated via the traditional pump pushers on either side of the crown. 
Vintage Heuer prices have started climbing over the past few years. They haven't quite caught up to the likes of Rolex in general, but there has been a steady rise since 
 after premiums at an Antiquorum auction in September 2013. Just a few weeks ago 
 for almost $45,000. It remains to be seen how much upside is left on a watch like this, but it's unlikely we've yet reached the peak of the market for these early, rare examples.

=== Title: Vintage Rolex Submariner From the Commander of Sealab III - Bloomberg ===

Military provenance is one of the easiest ways to add tons of value to a vintage Rolex. While this Submariner didn't belong to 
, it was on the wrist of the commander of the U.S. Navy's Sealab III mission, and now it's hitting the auction block. 
Commander Jackson Maxwell Tomsky hailed from San Francisco and enlisted in the Navy during World War II. After the war ended, he bounced around a few diving-related Navy jobs before he ended up running the Sealab III mission in 1969. The third installment of a Navy research program placed a habitable capsule 600 feet below the ocean (note the 660ft depth rating on this Submariner) that aquanauts could live in for two-month stints.
The watch comes from the family of the original owner, which vouches for its authenticity, though it doesn't come with government documentation or paperwork. Tomsky's granddaughter's word and the "Sealab 3" engraving on the caseback are all we have to go on. The U.S. Navy did not issue Rolex watches to combat divers during this era (unlike, say, the British Ministry of Defense), and a Submariner associated with U.S. military history is rare, indeed. 
Even if we ignore the provenance entirely, this is an incredible Submariner. The bezel, which started as black, has faded to an almost-white shade of gray, which is called "ghosting" in vintage-Rolex parlance. This is one of the most evenly and drastically ghosted bezels I've seen. Subs at this time had gilt dials, with all-gold printing, and the Rolex logo at 12 o'clock and depth rating at 6 o'clock are the exact same color, one very similar to the creamy, custard color the luminous markers and hands have turned. There's some flaking on the black dial, but it's not inconsistent with the wear-and-tear seen across the rest of the watch. The movement inside looks almost brand-new. 
It's worth noting that Sealab III encountered a few problems. During an underwater mission to repair the capsule in 1969, just two days after it launched, a diver died from of a mix of technical problems and human error, according to the Navy's assessment. Tomsky was formally reprimanded, though it didn't end his career. One has to believe that this blemish on the watch's history, by association with its former owner, will negatively affect the final auction price. 
This Rolex Submariner is 
 in 
 in New York. It carries an estimate of $30,000 to $50,000. 
 

=== Title: Only True Watch Nerds Will Appreciate Arnold & Son’s Latest Creation - Bloomberg ===

No one has ever accused Arnold & Son of being a mass-market brand. It makes complicated watches in small numbers for true mechanical watch fans—and with this new beast, it's appealing to the nerdiest of the bunch. 
The Constant Force Tourbillon is actually even more complicated than its name might suggest (considering it's already a mouthful to say). The watch starts with a pretty simple concept: to push precision to its logical conclusion. Then the watchmakers go deep into show-off territory, by revealing every little facet of the mechanics required to achieve that goal. Let's see what I mean by that, bit by bit.
First up, the tourbillon, which is somehow the simplest part of this watch.
A tourbillon is a rotating carriage mechanism that was originally designed to mitigate the negative effects that gravity would have on a pocket watch's accuracy, specifically how it'd weigh down the spring as it sat in your pocket, stretching it out of shape and ruining the amplitude. A tourbillon evened out that force—so for a wristwatch, it's an unnecessary complication given the spring moves into all sorts of positions throughout normal use. But it is considered a must-have for hyperprecise watches. 
Like I said, we're getting real nerdy here. 
As a tribute to the past—specifically marine chronometers created by brand namesake John Arnold and other British clockmakers—the balance beats at just 3 Hz, the traditional speed for a tourbillon pocket watch (most wristwatches function at 4 Hz). 
But let's move on to where things really get interesting.
You'll notice the two large power barrels at the top of the dial—they power the watch through a constant force system. This means that as the first barrel winds down, the second makes up the difference and keeps the amount of torque even throughout the full power reserve. When torque drops off, a watch becomes less accurate, so a steady flow keeps the watch performing at its best. 
To show off all the precision, Arnold & Son engineered a third and final nerdy flourish: a deadbeat-seconds mechanism at 7 o'clock.
Mechanically this isn't too different from what you'll see in 
, though aesthetically it's much more subtle. Most brands would have just thrown the seconds hand on top of the tourbillon cage, a perfectly acceptable, if simple, solution. The extra mechanism here is meant for the die-hards who appreciate the complexity and want to see each precisely measured second ticked out discretely.
Which is all to say, the mechanics on this watch are stellar. If you have a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering (yeah, I'm looking at you), this trifecta of complications is certainly impressive enough.
For the rest of us self-schooled watch nerds, the finishings are beautiful, too. The movement is housed in a 46mm red gold case; bridges are brushed on the surfaces and polished on the bevels; the back of the movement has a semi-industrial feel to it; and the signature Arnold & Son hands are present on the dial. I think that word you're looking for on the tip of your tongue is "squeee."

=== Title: Inside James Bond's Rolex, For Sale at Phillips Watch Auction - Bloomberg ===

On Nov. 8 in Geneva, Phillips is selling the 
 that Roger Moore wore as James Bond in 1973’s 
. Yes, this watch touched 007's suave wrist.
Looking at the watch, it seems like a simple enough 1972 Rolex Submariner (ref. 5513 for the nerds), but it's far from that. Production designer Syd Cain—basically a real-life Q—got hold of it prior and heavily modified it for filming. Nowadays, Bond watches are 
 and the Daniel Craig films have all heavily featured various Omega watches. The watch even gets a straight call-out during a tension-filled train ride in 
, during which Craig flat-out states that he doesn't wear Rolex, much to Eva Green's chagrin.
Unlike other Bond watches, though, this Rolex is more than a stylish accessory. Take a closer look at that bezel. Cain recut the teeth to look like those on a circular saw, so they face the clockwise direction instead of sticking straight out. Bond uses the saw to cut through some ropes holding him and a heroine hostage at a critical point in the movie.
The secret agent is also told that his new watch can generate a strong magnetic field on command, but he needs to test it out. Obviously 007 opts for using it to unzip actress Madeline Smith’s dress. If you look at the bottom of the watch, on the bracelet's endlink, the secret to this effect is revealed: There’s a tiny hole where a wire could be placed to hook onto the zipper pull. 
Looking inside the watch, there's a surprise: no movement, just a weight. So no, this watch doesn’t actually tell time, it’s purely a movie prop. That's going to be a deal-breaker for a lot of collectors, but as a consolation prize the inside is signed "Roger Moore 007." 
Provenance is everything for a lot like this, and in addition to the autograph, whoever buys the watch will get some original stills from the film’s production along with some of Cain’s hand-drawn sketches for the watch’s modification. They're little extras that make this feel a lot more like a complete package.
This isn't the first time we've seen this watch at auction. It first sold publicly back in 2001 at Christie's in London as part of a memorabilia sale. 
, about 30 percent above the $29,000 high estimate. Christie’s sold the watch again 10 years later in November 2011, this time at a watch-specific auction, and 
—a not insignificant jump after just a decade. Now the estimate is $150,000 to $250,000, so it’s entirely possible the watch sells for less this time around.
It might sound all too simple, but not being a functioning timekeeper is a serious knock. In 2012, a watch worn by 
 on the set of 
 
, and it's not crazy to think that if this watch still had the original movement inside, but just aesthetic modifications, it might be worth $1 million or more. 
Still, if you’re looking for a real James Bond watch, it doesn’t get any more legit than this.
Live and Let Die

=== Title: A Quirky Bulova Watch With a Surprise Under the Hood: Monday Morning Find - Bloomberg ===

With all the talk about "the Swiss watch industry," it's easy to forget that not every ticking mechanism is born in the Alps. In the early 20th century, Bulova was making watches in New York and the surrounding area, including this incredible little time capsule.
Bulova was founded back in 1875 and has been based in the borough of Queens for most of its history; today, under the ownership of Japanese watchmaker Citizen, its current world headquarters are in the Empire State Building. Though movements were made in Switzerland as early as 1912, Bulova had a case factory in Sag Harbor, New York, 
, and a watchmaking school at its Queens factory that worked with local schools to train up young professionals. It's a true American watchmaker through and through.
This vintage find, simply called a Reference 45, dates to approximately 1932 and looks every bit the part: long and rectangular. (Remember, this the same era that gave us the Cartier Tank.) 38mm wide by 22mm long with arched lugs and faceted case, the watch has a bit of a curved look. The ornate hands are what's called "lozenge-shaped," and they're a bright blue that stands out against the creamy dial.
You might be wondering where the crown is on this watch. No, it's not a crown-less 
, it's just tucked away. But where?
Underneath the hinged caseback is a small knurled crown along the edge and a tiny button too. Turning the crown adjusts the time, but pushing that little button winds the caliber 7AP movement inside. Theoretically, the outer caseback will press the plunger over and over as you wear the watch throughout the day, making this a sort of semi-automatic movement. I've never used one of these myself, so I can't speak to the usefulness, but it's a great concept. 
The only downside to the innovative mechanism is that the extra caseback makes the watch thicker than it would be if purely manually wound, but it's not too much.
The case is in good condition, still showing a mixture of brushed and polished finishes, and the dial has pretty even color for something that's 80-years-old. The scrolling Arabic numerals might look like discolored tritium in these photographs, but they're actually applied yellow gold with a polished finish.
If you're looking for a modestly priced piece of watchmaking history, I found it for you.

=== Title: Five Best Weekend Watches - Bloomberg ===

Hey, it's Friday. Time to loosen up.
You wouldn't wear a tie with your polo shirt, so once happy hour rolls around, you should take off that 
 and put on something a little more appropriate for the farmers market (or your kid's soccer game). You can go full-on off-duty with a big, brash chronograph, or you can pump the brakes and opt for something that's informal but understated. Whatever watch you choose, steel and titanium will take the place of gold and platinum (and you won't have to manually wind anything).
Here are our favorite weekend warriors. 
The Tissot PRS 516 is an underappreciated icon. It often gets lost among the Daytonas and Carreras of the sport watch world, but the PRS 516 has been around since 1965, making it 50 this year. The newest models carry through all the recognizable traits from the original, such as the steering-wheel-inspired strap and the hour markers that are suspended above the dial, letting the hands pass underneath. 
 has added some premium touches, though, like a black ceramic tachymeter bezel that won't get all scratched up and an automatic movement with 60 hours of power reserve. This is one you can beat up without a second thought. 
Bremont has designed 
 that are lightweight and wearable thanks to special titanium alloys developed by aviation giant Boeing. They're also bulletproof, if crime fighting happens to be on the weekend agenda. The bright yellow GMT hand and blue stitching on the strap add some color to the otherwise grayscale package. Short sleeves are suggested, since the watch is on the thick side, but a military-style spring jacket wouldn't be out of the question. There's also a basic GMT model sans chronograph (one of my 
), but this guy has a little extra edge that feels appropriate right now. 
The 
 is Shinola's flagship watch, and the basic design hasn't changed much since the launch in 2013. But each season, Shinola brings out new dial and strap colors, giving the line a little refresh. You can go for a bright color like 
 or 
 if you're trying to match your critter pants, but this gray-on-gray combo is my favorite. The straps are made in Florida from leather tanned in Chicago for a watch made in Detroit, upping the "Made in America" ante. If you're looking for a basic workhorse watch, the Runwell ticks a lot of boxes. 
When 
, I nearly fell out of my chair. Typically, the divide between modern and vintage Breitling watches is vast. The former are shiny, oversized, and scream for attention, while the latter are rugged, all about functionality, and get the tiniest details right. This watch looks every bit the part of yesterday's Breitlings, but with all the manufacturer's modern tech inside, including an in-house chronograph movement. The mesh strap is perfect for humid days (no wrist sweat, please) and everything from the red tip on the seconds hand to the little luminous markers in that top subdial make you lean in for a closer look. The 
 is one of the best Breitlings in years. 
Find me a better summer watch. I dare you. The bright blue color is inspired by 
 that collectors are clamoring over right now and extends from the dial to the matte ceramic bezel and even to the molded rubber strap. This 
 (previously only available in black) also adds the same in-house Tudor movement found in the 
, a first for Tudor. At 42mm it's a great size for wearing off-duty and because it's made of titanium, it won't weigh you down. The best part? It's only $275 more than the previous Pelagos, which used an ETA movement, bringing unbelievable value. 

=== Title: Patek Philippe Becomes Most Expensive Wristwatch Ever Sold - Bloomberg ===

On Saturday, at the Only Watch charity auction in Geneva, a one-of-a-kind Patek Philippe wristwatch sold for 7.3 million Swiss Francs ($7.26 million). This makes it the most expensive wristwatch ever sold publicly. Did I mention it's made of stainless steel?
The 
 is held every other year to raise money for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and brands big and small dontate unique watches to be sold. This year, Patek contributed 
, a grande complication that includes a tourbillon, minute repeater, and retrograde perpetual calendar all in a small, wearable package. The steel case is complemented by a rich blue dial and matching strap. It's beautiful, highly complex, and an obvious trophy for collectors. There was no question this was going to be the top lot of the sale.
The 5016A (the A denotes a steel case) carried an estimate of 700,000 to 900,000 Swiss Francs, and it blew that out of the water. The hammer fell with the bidder in for 7.3 million Swiss Francs, more than 10 times the low estimate and almost double the next highest price ever paid for a wristwatch. It's proof that unique Patek Philippe watches are seen as strong investments by collectors and I wouldn't be surprised if this watch spent the next decade or two in a vault before emerging back to the auction block.
This wasn't the only crazy result of the day though. 
 meant to look like the very first Tudor Submariner, fetched 375,000 Swiss Francs, more than 100 times the low estimate. At 3,500 to 4,500 Swiss Francs, the estimate was unbelievably low and the watch was clearly going to sell for much more, but considering you can get 
 for $3,100 the price is 100% attributable to the fact that this watch is one-of-a-kind.
If there were any doubts, rarity still seems to be king in the world of watch collecting.
Results did vary wildly though. Unsurprisingly, The 
, a mash-up of Journe's two most desirable watches, fetched 550,000 Swiss Francs, more than double the low estimate. And obviously the Tudor and Patek watches will be considered massive successes. But, the very first lot of the sale barely hit the low estimate, and a few of the 44 watches even sold below the estimates, including 
 that I expected to do very well. 
In all, Only Watch 2015 raised 11,268,000 Swiss Francs with 44 watches and clocks. 

=== Title: 'Peacocking' Men May Boost Pink iPhone Sales as the Hue Fades With Women - Bloomberg ===

Let's face it, the "rose gold" iPhone 6s is pink. 
We all know it. It doesn’t even seem as if Apple tried very hard to replicate the salmony glint of a rose-gold piece of jewelry. It went all in with pink.
"It's kind of a Kim Kardashian pink. It feels like an extension of the gold in that it's just kind of over-the-top glam,'' says Cas Holman, an associate professor at the Rhode Island School of Design who studies gender roles in design. So who will be running out to buy this new hue?
The question of colors and gender-association may seem outdated, but pink remains the color with the most gender baggage, says Holman, who also creates children's toys. She purposefully works pink colors into pieces of a building block set she designed that might otherwise be seen as a "boy" toy.  The issue of gender-specific clothing and playthings has come to the forefront recently, with Target 
 recently, and startup companies 
. The shift has garnered much discussion online. 
"The second I saw the rose-gold finish I had to get it," says Jorge Enrique, 26, a nursing student from San Antonio who has been chronicling each step of the process on his Twitter account. "I’ve always been partial to red, pink, and copper mixes and it stood out considerably from the other colors. It just pops more."
He says he has six friends who have preordered the rose-gold color for a new iPhone 6s and four of them are male. Apple has not given details on preorders of the phone and won't comment on the demand for the color, but blogs and social media posts suggest demand has already created a backlog for the specific color. (Apple watches are now
 in rose gold, too.) The rarity of the item contributes to its appeal, Enrique suggests.
And anyway, men are leaning in more to pink. According to the Color Association of the United States, four different pink colors will become popular over the next four seasons, while only one will wax transcendent for women. Leslie Harrington, executive director of the 100-year-old group, says men's color preferences show pink hues trending for this fall into next summer, even as women shift toward more muted tones, she says.
     
"Men have been peacocking it out over the last few years more than women," she says, noting, "You go to an event, and women are all black and white. The men have teal, turquoise—pink shirts—they're really looking a lot at color."
Whatever the reaction from men, Apple isn't going out on any limbs with the choice of rose gold, as the selection follows several years of increasing popularity that stems from the use in jewelry and makeup, says Allison Heape, a color stylist in the industrial coating business at PPG Industries, which sells coatings for some smartphones but not for the iPhone.
In recent years, the color has been showing up in accent piece such as vases at Target, a signal of mainstream appeal, she says. Her team has been watching the trend grow for at least the last two years, Heape says. Rose gold also captures a more luxury feel that helps justify the higher costs of the phones. In its recent Tiffany T collection of jewelry for men and women, the iconic American brand reports that the male versions of rings and cuff bracelets in rose gold have been very popular.
"Apple is very good at honing in on the perfect iconic thing and making it seem like they came up with it out of nowhere,'' she says. "They are very in sync with the sentiment of their time.'' 
The very idea that pink is a color for girls is a relatively new concept, says Jo Paoletti, an associate professor of American Studies at the University of Maryland and author of the book 
. Midway through the last century, in some places in the U.S., pink was considered more appropriate for men because it was a "strong" color and the "softer" blue was better for women, she says. Some such proclivities persisted into the 1970s, Paoletti says.
"Pink always means something,'' she says. "A guy wearing pink has to explain himself.''

=== Title: REC P-51, a Mechanical Watch Made from Old Mustangs - Bloomberg ===

Cars and watches go together like, well, cars and watches. Still, the new P-51 watch doesn't just take inspiration from the auto world. Its dial is made from metal that was salvaged from 1960s Mustangs.
The P-51 is the second mechanical watch from Danish brand 
, which started last year with a model that referred to another classic '60s car, the Mini. While that one was a little lower-key, more Mini, this watch is a muscular 44 millimeters, with a cushion-shaped case and an unusual dial configuration. Everything, from the numeral fonts to the shapes of the hands, is meant to recall the old cars. The top dial looks like a fuel gauge and shows the power reserve, while the speedometer-inspired main dial tells the hours, minutes, and seconds. Just below that is a date display meant to look like a mileage gauge. There's no mistaking the P-51 for anything other than a car guy's watch.
The real star, though, is the dial plate surrounding the various displays. It's cut from a sheet of metal salvaged from a vintage Mustang that was destined for the scrap yard. (No functioning cars were harmed in the making of these watches.) The little plate up around 11 o'clock tells you the year and chassis number of the Mustang, too. If you want to know even more about the car, each watch will come with a card you can scan with your phone to see a video about the specific Mustang your watch's dial came from. (A number of cars will be used in production, with a good number of watch dials drawn from any single car).
"There are a lot of Mustang wrecks out there, but many of these are 50 years old and have changed hands many times," said Jonathan Kamstrup, REC Watches co-founder. This can make finding the most interesting cars difficult. "We are teaming up with none other than the Mustang Club of America, the world's biggest Mustang community, in order to find just the right wrecks and stories." 
Powering all this is a Japanese Miyota 9130 movement. It is automatic (you can see the stylized winding rotor through the window on the back of the watch), packs 48 hours of power reserve, and has 26 jewels. It's a solid workhorse movement and presents great value vs. comparable Swiss movements. For such a watch, it's the perfect choice.
The P-51 comes in three color version, each with its own look.
The black-and-gold version has really elegant grey display dials but is definitely the most aggressive, while the version with creme dials and blue hands (the closest color scheme to what you might find in a vintage Mustang) is probably the easiest to wear. That said, the third choice, with a combination black PVD and steel case and black subdials, best captures the sporty vibe. All three work well with the worn metal dial, which sports a mottled brown-and-silver color rather like that of rust.
The P-51 is being launched 
. Pledges starting at $745 will get you a watch. When the items are available for retail—the company is just over a third of the way to its $200,603 goal—sale prices will be twice as high, at $1,495. If all goes well, the first P-51s will start shipping in March 2016.

=== Title: Here’s What Happens When a Famously Bulky Watch Goes on a Crash Diet - Bloomberg ===

Sometimes you know you’re going to love a watch right away. Sometimes a watch surprises you. I wasn’t so sure when I first heard about the 
 SpidoLite, because it’s big and futuristic-looking—but after a few seconds with it on my wrist, I was sold. In fact, it was one of my 
. Here’s why.
It ticks a lot of boxes. There’s the unique design, the robust construction, and the futuristic looks. For every trait that could have been troublesome, Danish designer Morten Linde seems to have found a fix.
I expected to find the SpidoLite’s size difficult to stomach. The case is 46mm top to bottom, 44mm across, and 15mm thick. This is a big one. But what makes the SpidoLite unique is the heavily skeletonized case. The art of cutting sections out of dials to show the movement underneath is popular right now, but Linde Werdelin has applied a similar method to the SpidoLite’s case. The company kept the distinct oversize profile while removing all the unnecessary metal, and thus weight. The result looks like something that might be used to fight off a Xenomorph, and it wears lighter and smaller than you’d expect.
That’s not to say the dial hasn’t been carved apart as well. Other than the markers around the edge, there are no large solid sections of dial to be seen at all. The asymmetrical cutouts are a little overwhelming at first, but they keep your eye moving all over the dial to check out how each bit is finished. The overall effect is one of controlled chaos.
Linde Werdelin claims that the open top of the barrel is a sort of minimalist power-reserve indicator, because you can see whether the spring inside is tight (full power) or loose (running on empty). That might be a bit of an overstatement, but the design is cool nonetheless. 
The biggest surprise of all is that I found myself wanting to take home the gold SpidoLite even more than the titanium edition. Oversize gold watches with ornate dials aren’t exactly my thing. I’m a worn-in vintage fan, more likely to drool over something 
 than over something like 
. But when a gold watch is this comfortable and starts to look better with age instead of just dinged up, that’s something special.
People have drawn parallels between Linde Werdelin’s watches and the likes of the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore and Hublot Big Bang. Sure, they’re all large sport watches with occasionally bold styling, but the SpidoLite sets itself apart with the complex case and quirky skeletonized dial. They might owe a little inspiration to big-brand predecessors, but they’re far from clones.
Is the SpidoLite for everyone? Absolutely not. Is it even for me (and my wrist) on most days? Not really. But it’s a thoughtfully designed and fun-to-wear watch that convinced me that ignoring a whole category of watches might be a mistake after all.
The 
 is available in titanium and rose gold, priced at 15,000 Swiss francs (about $15,700) and 27,000 Swiss francs ($28,300), respectively. Each is limited to 75 numbered pieces.

=== Title: Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve 2015 Nominees: Best Watches in the World - Bloomberg ===

The Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève (
) is the most prestigious award ceremony in watchmaking—and we have an early first look at this year's nominees.
Makers big and small submit their latest creations to a jury of experts (including celebrity guest judges who also happen to be watch nerds, like 
) to be considered across 12 categories. At this stage there are 193 watches from 84 different brands that meet the criteria worth judging. Before the Oct. 29 ceremony, a short list of finalists will be announced, clarifying things a little. Then the jury will huddle for two days in a Geneva hotel to debate each and every detail before voting on winners and crowning the watches of the year.
For now, the almost 200-strong list presents a macro look at the state of the industry in all its quirky glory. Here are this year's entries in alphabetical order and my thoughts on what to, well, watch.
 
These are watches where the mechanism inside is less important than the ornate work put into the cases, dials, and jewels—they grab your attention immediately. Enamel work and gem setting are in the field every year, but the layered metal Shakudo dial from 
 is truly unusual, and the sort of thing you could imagine yourself staring at for hours. It strikes the right balance between being a little over the top without going totally crazy.

Calendar watches come in many incarnations, and this is a tough field to judge. The 
 FreakLab isn't a full perpetual calendar, but it does have a unique setting mechanism that makes it a real contender here. However, for my money, it's all about that 
 Slim d'Hermès perpetual calendar. It's slim (duh), really easy to wear, and tracks a second time zone, too. It was 
at Baselworld 2015, and I'm still not over it.

Chronographs are extremely popular with collectors, so no matter which watches I tell you to pay attention to, someone is going to tell you I'm 100 percent wrong and have terrible taste. But here goes anyway: The 
 Carrera Calibre 18 isn't the most mechanically impressive chronograph, but it's the watch from this field I'd most want to wear, followed by the 
 Altiplano Chrono, which is razor thin and incredibly made. The winner here, though, is an easy pick: the 
 
. It's one of the most flat-out impressive watches I've ever seen and a totally new vision of what a modern chronograph can be. I'll be shocked if it doesn't take this category easily.

I mean, just look at what we're dealing with here ... if you asked me to judge this category, I think I'd struggle. It's more about the creative ways that gems are set and strung together, the ways that mechanisms are miniaturized to fit the delicate bracelets, and the originality of the designs. I think 
's large, multi-tier cuff and 
's colorful bracelet watch are both finalists, but beyond that I'm stumped.

The diversity here is staggering. I think it might be a more diverse field overall than the men's category. Sure, there are the usual suspects—adaptations of a men's watch, only a few millimeters smaller and covered in diamonds—but there are also some truly ambitious pieces. The 
 Boy∙Friend in beige gold is striking and elegant, while the 
 Millenary shows off the escapement. Whatever watch ultimately takes the day, you can count on it being something interesting.

Watchmakers used to largely ignore the super high end of the women's watch market, preferring to inflate price tags with sparkles instead of extra engineering. Those days are long gone. 
s highly skeletonized Altiplano has diamonds integrated into the structure of the movement, but 
's Lady 8 Flower has a tiny bubble above the main watch dial that houses a mechanical flower that opens and closes on demand. It's awesome, and when I first saw the watch a few months ago, I couldn't stop playing with it.

If you're looking for the crazy stuff, the "Mechanical Exception" category is it. The 
 Génie 03 Anemometer has a 
 built in (that uses tiny metal cups that pop up from the dial), and the 
 Key of Time lets you speed up or slow down the movement at will. Independent watchmaker 
's Complication One is beyond incredible with its oversized escapement on the dial, while the 
 Charming Bird has a miniature bird perched inside that simulates the sound of chirping when you activate it. These are all serious competitors, and I can't wait to see the short list for this category.

We might as well just call this category "watch." The only requirement is that the watch be targeted toward men. That's it. So there is a time-only watch made from fair-mined gold (thanks 
), the car engine-inspired 
 HMX, a technicolor worldtimer from 
, and an everyday army green chronograph from 
. See what I mean? But for me, there's a clear standout. It has a plain white dial, slim blue hands, and it's not even Swiss. The Credor Eichi II comes from

The "little hand" award is limited to watches that retail for less than 8,000 CHF (about $8,500). The focus is on watches that offer a lot of value, which can come in a lot of different forms. 
's North Flag has an 
 and a case that's built like a tank, while the 
 Heritage Spirit Orbis Terrarum has a true worldtimer complication for a tiny fraction of the price of a comparable Patek Philippe or Vacheron Constantin.

What makes a good sport watch is very different from what makes a great complicated watch. The finishing on the movement and the use of precious materials are superfluous (though sometimes nice). Instead wearability, durability, and legibility are the real keys. The blue update to 
's Pelagos has all of the above, plus the added bonus of an in-house movement. The 
 Manufacture Flyback Chronograph is the kind of watch you could throw down a mountain and not worry about. 
's decision to enter the TimeWalker Urban Speed Chronograph with e-Strap (Montblanc's 
) might be the most interesting thing buried in this category and is worth keeping your eye on.

Chiming watches are one of the toughest things a watchmaker can try to produce, so the number of brands that can really do it right is pretty small. The coolest thing about the field here is that it's not just jam-packed with traditional minute repeaters. 
's alarm repeater is present, as is the Tourbillon Chiming Jump Hour from upstart 
. The 
 Minute Repeater is actually a decimal repeater, meaning it chimes hours, 10 minutes, and minutes, instead of hours, quarter-hours, and minutes. It might be the most restrained-looking watch in this category, but it's my No. 1 pick.
A. Lange & Söhne — Zeitwerk Minute Repeater

Christophe Claret — Allegro
Franc Vila — Inaccessible Tourbillon Minute Repeater
Girard-Perregaux — Minute Repeater Tourbillon with Gold Bridges
Hublot — Big Bang Alarm Repeater
The tourbillon is essentially 
 complication when it comes to high-end watchmaking, even if the spinning cage isn't to everyone's taste (mine included). Making a fancy, visually striking tourbillon feels old hat, and I think the winner here is going to win on the merits of something more subtle. 
's Venturer Tourbillon Dual Time has an interchangeable tourbillon module, making the watch much easier to service over time, and the 
 
 has a constant force escapement and a slew of silicium parts for durability and accuracy. That said, counting out 
 in this category is always a big, big mistake.

=== Title: The Nordic Cook Book by Magnus Nilsson Recipes - Bloomberg ===

Chef Magnus Nilsson's restaurant 
 is housed in a hunting lodge deep in northern Sweden.
Visit in winter and the drive of almost two hours from Östersund airport is through a landscape that looks bleak and inhospitable, icy winds driving snow that thickly carpets the fields.
It is cold. Very cold.
It's not really the kind of place you might go looking for interesting food. But Nilsson shows the range and diversity of the region's cuisine in "
" (£29.95/$49.95, Phaidon). It's a hefty volume of 763 pages that's surprisingly accessible. One of the first recipes details how to boil an egg.
Nilsson, 31, is an approachable and accessible guy. He's got long hair and rock-star looks, with a twinkle in his eye and a quiet sense of humor. While he is proud of his Nordic heritage, and traveled extensively to research the book, he's more keen to communicate than to preach: He's serious without being earnest.
"I want people to see past the herrings and the gravlax and the meatballs," he says in an interview. "For me, it's super important with a book like this that it shouldn't be an idealized, fairy-tale museum version of reality. It needs to be a snapshot of what people actually eat today.
"There's a lot to discover because Nordic cuisine is very inaccessible. If we went to Spain and went into a random restaurant in Madrid, we'd be able to have a meal that's indicative of an everyday meal that someone could have in their house, a truly Spanish meal. If you go to Stockholm and try to do the same, it doesn’t exist. Food culture in the Nordics is carried in the home. It's not in restaurants.
"That makes it difficult for people to understand. This book shows that. I counted through and there are about 730 recipes of which about 50 no one will ever cook because they contain puffin or something like that that you can't get hold of.
 "They are still important for explaining a culture or a context. But the remaining 680 recipes are things that people actually cook on an everyday basis."
Nilsson, who was born in Selånger and raised in Östersund, says that few people he meets even know the difference between Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway and Denmark) and the Nordic region, which encompasses Finland and Iceland, as well as Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Åland.
He says that the quickest way to understand the region's food culture is to eat an open sandwich topped with butter and hard cheese.
"I'm asked so many times to name a couple of Nordic dishes and really there aren't any: They don’t exist," he says. "One of the few things that tie the region together is that the seasons are defined and you have a winter season where you can't harvest fresh plant material, no vegetables, so you have to produce excess in the summer, store it and keep it for winter.
"That's the defining factor in the whole region. One of the only examples of a dish that shows this is the sandwich, because it is so different in different parts of the region.
"If you go to Denmark and have smørrebrød, it says a lot about the country. In Denmark, with all its trade and being a rich agricultural country with lots of food production, the sandwiches are piled so high, you can't even pick them up without making a mess.
"Then you go up to where I come from, north Sweden, the sandwich there will be a piece of flatbread with a layer of salty butter and a thin layer of cheese and that's it. Something you can eat standing up.
"And that says a lot about the circumstances in that area as being far less rich.
"In Iceland, they have few trees, and loaves of bread backed in ovens are a very new thing. Even today, in areas around volcanoes and hot springs, each village has a site where every family has a hole in the ground with a lid on it. You go there in the evening with your rye bread, put it in there and in the morning, it's baked, it's steamed.
"Nordic cuisine doesn’t describe one homogenous food culture. It’s a composite of various food cultures over an extensive area, much bigger than the whole of Europe put together."
If you would like to try Nilsson's dishes at Fäviken - such as Norwegian scallops cooked over fire - that may prove difficult.
The restaurant seats a maximum of 24 guests. Only five meals are served a week. It will be closed for about seven weeks between March and May. It's a real trek to reach. And it is heavily booked. If you do get in, the meal costs 2,200 kronor ($258) plus drinks.
It's worth it. "The Nordic Cookbook" helps to show why.
Here are some sample recipes, along with thoughts on each from Nilsson.
This mix of shrimp (baby shrimp) and mayo was invented by Swedish chef Tore Wretman in the 1950s, and it was named after the northern Danish city of Skagen. Skagen salad is funnily enough almost completely unknown in Denmark, whereas in Sweden it has remained one of the most popular starters (appetizers) altogether. Often served on slices of white bread fried in butter and topped with Bleak Roe in a dish called Toast Skagen. Today skagenröra loosely refers to any creamy salad made from something that could possibly be red shellfish. Some of these salads are great and others are awful. The original contains shrimp, mayonnaise and dill (according to some accounts with the addition of a bit of grated horseradish). The worst more recent addition is onion – red or any other kind. It makes the delicate dilly mix smell to me like standing in a dirty second-hand clothes store, a bit like sweat aged on synthetic fibres from the 1960s. Don’t add onion to your Skagen salad. Also it contains absolutely no dairy products. Many modern recipes contain crème fraîche and they are wrong. It will only result in a sour taste and a too liquid salad.
If you have made a great mayo it will be acidic enough and you won’t feel that the salad lacks in acidity. This is important as adding liquids like vinegar or lemon will make it too wet. Serve the salad with a wedge of lemon on the side.
Coarsely chop half the shrimp (baby shrimp) tails and place them in a bowl with the remaining whole shrimp tails. Add enough mayo to properly coat all of the shrimp and make the mix creamy. Be careful though not to add too much as this will turn everything into more of a sauce, which is not the idea. Add the dill, salt and pepper and some grated horseradish if you like it. Let the salad sit for 10 minutes or so in the fridge. Stir again, adjust the texture with more mayo if necessary and once again adjust the seasoning.
Pot-roasted chicken is a dish with a very old history. It would seem logical that this was a practical way of cooking a whole bird until juicy and tender, without the use of an oven, the pot in itself creating a little miniature oven when placed on top of a heat source. The wood-fired cast iron stove which offered the first really usable oven available to most modest homes that couldn’t afford or fit a brick oven was popularized during the mid-nineteenth century, and it is easy to imagine this technique being way older than that.
The funny thing, today, is that most of the more recent recipes for pot-roasted chicken place the pot in the oven for the actual cooking as opposed to the stove top. This is obviously very convenient, but also makes you question if it wouldn’t be better to just roast the bird without the lid to get some crispness on the skin and just skipping the pot altogether and using an ordinary roasting pan… Anyhow, I often make pot-roasted chicken in the oven and, even if it doesn’t make sense, it feels good somehow.
Chicken like this is, in Denmark, often served with Boiled Potatoes, Brown Gravy, and Quick Pickled Cucumber. In Sweden the gravy is most often substituted with a basic cream Sauce. Both the gravy and sauce most of the time are seasoned with liberal amounts of Chinese mushroom soy sauce. Most Swedes would also want some Black-currant Jelly and some, including myself, like some browned Brussels sprouts with their chicken.
Season the chicken well with salt and pepper, both inside and out.
Melt some butter with a little oil in a heavy cast iron pot or ovenproof dish over a medium-high heat and brown the bird all over. Take the pot off the heat and sit the bird breast-side up. Add the liver, heart, gizzard, vegetables, garlic and herbs, then pour in the wine. Cover with a lid and bring to a simmer over a low heat. (Or place it in an oven, preheated to 150°C/300°F). Cook the bird for 30–40 minutes, which makes it just cooked and juicy, or longer if you like it more well-done.
Waffles are served all over the Nordic region and each country has got a multitude of recipes. Some have eggs in them and others don’t. In general terms a waffle with eggs will be less crisp and more rich than one without. Some versions are leavened with yeast or chemical leavening agents and others are not. If leavened with yeast or not at all, the recipe will produce a pancake-like texture and if leavened with chemical leavening agents, a shorter texture. Waffles are often served as lunch, a snack in the afternoon or as a dessert. In Norway, waffles can also be found with Brown Cheese for breakfast. In the whole Nordic region, waffles are most commonly cooked in the classic Scandinavian waffle iron, which produces heart-shaped pieces.
My favourite kind of waffle, crisp and delicate in an almost unreal way. Enjoy them hot off the iron with whipped cream and jam.
Whip the cream to soft peaks and fold it into the batter gently. It should be fully combined, but not overmixed.
Heat your waffle iron to proper working temperature and brush it very lightly with melted butter. Pour in a suitable amount of batter and cook until nice and golden. Repeat with the rest of the batter.

=== Title: Vacheron Constantin Unveils the Most Complicated Watch Ever Made - Bloomberg ===

We have a new horological king. The Vacheron Constantin Reference 57260 pocket watch is the most complicated mechanical watch ever made.
Watchmakers and their most type-A clients have long chased the title of most complicated watch. Early 20th century industrialists James Packard and Henry Graves Jr. one-upped one another by commissioning extravagant watches, essentially keeping Patek Philippe in business during the lean years between the two World Wars. Last year, Graves's so-called Supercomplication once again 
, fetching $24 million and topping the $11 million record it set in 1999.
A complication is any watch function that goes beyond showing the hours, minutes, and seconds. How you tally them for the purpose of doling out a "most complicated watch" award might seem pedantic, but additions big (split-seconds chronograph) and small (power reserve indicator) add up—and something that looks like a single feature, such as a perpetual calendar, can technically be counted as multiple complications, because the date, day, and month are each considered to be separate.
By Vacheron's count, the Reference 57260 has 57 distinct complications. This is all packed into a case that is 98 mm (3.86 inches) across and 50.55 mm (1.99 inches) thick. It looks like a pocketwatch, but it isn't fitting in your pants pocket soon. It has a solid 18k white gold case and densely packed components inside. It took a team of three watchmakers more than eight years to design and create the 2,800-component Reference 57260 from scratch. 
But enough of the surface-level stuff. Let's count our way to 57.
The front of this watch is the side with the gold Roman numerals up top. Starting with the time, the hours and minutes are shown with regulator-style hands, meaning the hours and minutes are on separate axes (1). These are the wide, curvy blue hands. Looking on the back, you'll see the three-axis tourbillon (2) housing a special spherical balance spring and escapement (3). The small gold hands show a second time zone (4), and there's also a world-time indicator (5) and day/night indicator to show you whether the world time is showing A.M. or P.M. (6). Confused yet? We're just getting started.
There are three (yes, three) full calendar systems in this watch. The first is a standard Gregorian perpetual calendar (7) that includes displays for the date with a retrograde hand (8), day of the week (9), month (10), and year in the leap year cycle (11). There are also indicators for the number of the day of the week (12) and number of the week in the year (13) in accordance with the ISO 8601 standard calendar. You know, just in case.
The second calendar is a Hebrew perpetual calendar (14). This shows the Hebrew name of the day (15), Hebrew name of the month (16), Hebrew date (17), Hebrew secular calendar (18), Hebrew year (19), whether the year has 12 or 13 months (20), where in the 19-year lunar cycle that year is (21), and the date of Jewish holy day Yom Kippur (22), which moves around the calendar.
Finally there's an astronomical calendar, which includes a display of the phases and age of the moon (23), a hand that tracks the movement through the Zodiac along with the equinoxes and solstices (24), a rotating sky chart (25), hands showing both hours and minutes for sidereal time (26-27), and an equation of time indicator for telling the difference between sidereal time and solar time (28). Sidereal time tracks the earth in relation to the stars instead of in relation to the sun—it's used mostly by astronomers and differs from solar time by plus or minus a few minutes, depending on the time of year. You can also see what time the sun will rise (29) and what time it will set (30) in the watch owner's home city as well as how long the day (31) and night (32) will each be on that day. With the three calendars, you're pretty much out of excuses for running late or missing appointments.
Of course there's also a chronograph, and it's one that's a first of its kind. It's a split-seconds chronograph that uses two hands accurate to one-fifth of a second (33-34) to record the seconds, each with its own column wheel for precise activation. These hands are retrograde, meaning they sweep up and back, instead of all the way around the dial. There's also a 60-minute counter (35) and a 12-hour counter with a column wheel (36) for timing longer intervals. All this also sits on the front of the watch.
Completing the grand complication function trio (calendar, chronograph, chiming) are both alarm and time-striking features. There's a single gong and hammer alarm (37) with a strike/silence indicator (38), an alarm-specific power-reserve indicator (39), a system to keep the power from being overwound (40), and a choice of having the alarm strike out the time with the grande or petite sonnerie (41).
You can also strike out the time on demand with the over-the-top carillon system, which simulates the Westminster Cathedral bells using a five-gong and five-hammer system (42). As time passes, you can have it automatically strike the hours and quarter hours with a grande sonnerie (43) or just the quarter hours with a petit sonnerie (44) and also activate a standard minute repeater function for striking the time on demand (45). The customer chose to have a night silencing feature to keep the sonnerie from activating between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. (46). Two independent indicators let you select the chiming mode and silencing feature (47-48). The alarm is also linked to the carillon system (49), so you can also select to use the carillon chimes as the alarm chime, which also has its own indicator (50).
We're getting close. Now we're in miscellaneous territory. There's a power reserve indicator for the main time-keeping system (51), a second power reserve indicator for the carillon striking system (52), a lock to stop the striking (53), a special winding system to let you power everything up (54), an indicator to show you what the crown is winding or setting (55), a multiposition setting system to aligning the hands (56), and a concealed winding crown just for the alarm (57). Whew. We made it. Fifty-seven it is.
The Reference 57260 was a special commission by a private collector and is not available for sale. At the request of the client, Vacheron Constantin is not disclosing the exact price, though based on the prices of other custom complicated watches, we estimate the collector is parting with upwards of $5 million. 

=== Title: How Not to Be a Jerk While Wearing the Apple Watch - Bloomberg ===

The Apple Watch 
, and starting on April 24 the devices will be popping up on the wrists of your friends and co-workers. You might even be getting one yourself. And if you are, there's one thing to keep in mind: If you're not careful, it could turn you into a rude jerk.
Apple wants the Watch to make you more present in the moment and to free you from the supposed tyranny of your iPhone, but what the Watch does is bring another screen into your life with all the associated tapping, beeping, and peek-sneaking. Here are a few crucial dos and don'ts to keep you from being that guy.
Bloomberg's own Joshua Topolsky 
 with the flood of notifications landing on his wrist. If you turn everything on, you're quickly going to find yourself overwhelmed and worse off than you were pre-Watch. Prioritize your notifications and only have the most important ones go to the Watch. The rest you can handle the old-fashioned way without making everyone around you think they are preventing you from getting to your next appointment.
Checking your wrist is the original impolite gesture. It says "I have somewhere else to be and I'm telling you to wrap it up." A quick glance most of us can forgive, but if the info you need from your Apple Watch isn't immediately discernible, lower your wrist and either finish what you're doing or politely excuse yourself to handle the alert. Standing with your wrist up and nodding like you're half-paying attention is the new old rude.
There's no keyboard on the Apple Watch, but the messenger app will generate auto responses by scanning your texts for pertinent details. You likely ignore these on your phone, but give them a second chance here. Use the phrases to get back to people quickly and with minimal effort and you'll look totally on top of your game. More important, it will lessen the time you spend interacting with the device. This won't work for everything, but it streamlines confirming the time of your next meeting or letting your date know you are running slightly late to 
.
If you manage to get your hands on an Apple Watch before the weather turns cold again, the last thing your friends are going to want to hear is how annoying you find it and how tough your life is because of it. (At first, this will be a strong urge. It takes some getting used to.) If wrist-tapping notifications, staring at loading screens, and arbitrarily limited app interactions don't sound like things you'll enjoy, cancel your order now. Embrace the experience with patience and optimism, or skip it altogether.
The Watch isn't the ideal tool for all situations. Whether it's a case of the app loading too slowly to be useful (like Apple's weather app) or needing more screen real estate (Instagram comes to mind), don't forget that you've still got that phone close by. Some of these interactions may get better with time, but don't insist on fumbling with the Watch like a dummy just because it's there. This all goes double if you're showing something to someone else. No one wants to squint at vacation photos on your Apple Watch from a strange angle, I promise.
Please. Don't. For anything that can't be handled with canned responses, the Apple Watch requires you to dictate the text to Siri. It's relatively accurate (or a little better than the phone, at least), but whatever you do, do not start talking into your watch outside the four walls of your home. The office conference room, the lunch line at Chipotle, and 
 are all off limits. You don't look like Dick Tracy. You just look like a ... well, you know.
It really shouldn't be that hard, right? There are situations where it should just 
 wrong to be using your Apple Watch. Follow your gut here. No pants? No Apple Watch. In a dark theater? No Apple Watch. Chewing something? You know what to do. If you screw up, fear not: Significant others, bosses, and friends will help you out here with dirty looks and passive-aggressive reminders to keep you on track.
I just can't take anyone wearing the Edition seriously. Tim Cook, Drake, Katy Perry, we get it, you're super rich and part of an exclusive club of people who get to wear a disposable 18-karat gold toy that costs five figures. Good for you. On anyone else, it just seems kind of insane.

=== Title: Roger Dubuis Excalibur Spider Pocket Time Instrument - Bloomberg ===

Roger Dubuis is a brand that's never shy. If you're a fan, you probably use adjectives like "bold" and "pioneering" to describe the ornately skeletonized watches that come from the Geneva-based manufacturer. If you're not a fan, "florid" might seem a less generous description.
Whatever your taste, though, there's no denying that the new 
 is flat-out insane.
This is a monster of a pocket watch. The case is 60mm across and just shy of 20mm thick. Luckily it's made of titanium, so it's not so heavy that it rips right through your pocket when you stash it away. There's a matching titanium chain, as well as a desk stand in case you don't want to carry the watch around all day. 
The real emphasis is on the oversized RD101 movement, which has four separate 
 counting out the time. Yep, 
. They're placed at opposing angles and are connected through a series of differential gears so they compensate for each other's slight inaccuracies. It's more a theoretical benefit than something that has tangible outcomes, but practicality clearly isn't the goal with this watch.
 
The Excalibur Spider Pocket Time Instrument is the second Roger Dubuis watch to use the RD101 movement, the 
 from 2013 being the first. The Time Instrument looks mostly like a blown-up version of the Quatuor, with a few aesthetic adjustments: The case is no longer black, the minutes and hour track has been moved from the center to the edge of the dial, and the finishing and accents are higher contrast. 
The entire thing has also been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, so the power reserve sits at 6 o'clock instead of 9 o'clock. That indicator has two crescents and a double-sided hand, but it tracks a single power source. The two-sided layout is purely for looks.
The RD101 contains 590 components—a ton for a watch that only shows the time and power reserve. (It doesn't even have a running seconds indicator.) Of those, 113 are 
, meaning almost 20 percent of the total components are dedicated to making sure everything runs smoothly. If the four balance wheels and the gears that connect them get gummed up, you could have big problems here.
Roger Dubuis's marketing materials for the Excalibur Spider Pocket Time Instrument suggest that the four 4Hz balance wheels run at an effective 16Hz. This isn't exactly true. The four balances' timekeeping is averaged, and that's what the hands display; a 16Hz balance would beat faster and with greater inertia, making it more impervious to shocks and deviations. The effects might be similar, but the methods are very different.
Like all Roger Dubuis watches, the Excalibur Spider Pocket Time Instrument carries the 
, or Geneva Seal. This means the entire watch is made in the Canton of Geneva and adheres to extremely stringent standards of finishing, accuracy, and assembly.
Looking at the creation purely objectively, there's a lot to love: The engineering of the movement is unique, every tiny component is carefully considered, and Roger Dubuis hasn't pulled any punches in terms of its point of view. Whether you like that point of view (or carrying something called a "Time Instrument") is another question entirely.
Strangely, Roger Dubuis wasn't the only brand to show a pocket watch this week at 
, a luxury-watch trade show in Hong Kong. 
, best known for more budget-friendly watches, showed off the Clifton 1830 Five-Minute Repeater, a solid gold pocket watch that chimes and carries a $54,000 price tag (not bad for a repeater; a lot for a Baume & Mercier).
Both of these come just weeks after 
 unveiled the 
, also a massive pocket watch. I don't think we're in a pocket watch renaissance, but I do think watchmakers are looking for new ways to show off what they can do to the most dedicated group of collectors.

=== Title: This Is the Watch Jaeger-LeCoultre Wants to Go Mainstream - Bloomberg ===

Jaeger-LeCoultre is really hoping you'll want this watch. The brand is popular among watch aficionados but doesn't have a broadly appealing, widely worn signature like the Rolex Submariner. The issue is that while the company makes more variations of in-house movements than I can count, there's nothing simple and easily digestible that balances technical prowess with sheer handsomeness. The Geophysic True Second is understated and attractive, and in steel it's less than $10,000. Maybe instead of dropping that first bonus on a Rolex, you'll go for this.
Last year the brand launched 
, a watch based on a vintage model from the brand's past. It was originally a watch for scientists working on nuclear submarines, so it was high-tech, anti-magnetic, and meant to be worn in pretty much any conditions imaginable. This new watch is the mainstream, everyday descendent of these earlier Geophysics.
The Geophysic True Second is Jaeger-LeCoultre's attempt at creating an affordable watch that can be worn day in and day out by a wide array of people—but not a timepiece that's so vanilla it will feel generic.
The watch has a 39.6 mm case held to the wrist with an alligator strap. The dial has a silver-grained texture, and the sharp hands have slim, luminous inserts for reading in any light. The baton-shaped hour markers, though, have no luminescence; instead, little glowing dots are set into the interior bezel around the dial's edge. It's something you have to see in person to truly appreciate. A subtle date window at 3 o'clock finishes things off. 
So far, so good. If this were it, the Geophysic True Second would still be a perfectly respectable watch. Interestingly, there's plenty more to talk about.
Turning the watch over, you see the caliber 770 movement, which is made in-house by Jaeger-LeCoultre. It's a simple enough looking movement, with a rose gold rotor to power the automatic winding for the 40-hour power reserve. But it's actually packing a ton of technology. Most notably, in the cutout by the center you can see a second spring that is tied to a deadbeat seconds complication. This means the seconds hand "ticks" like what you'd see on a quartz watch instead of slowly sweeping. Each second is marked out precisely, and that visible spring makes sure there's no snapping or wavering of the hand. 
If you want to get even more technical, the balance wheel that swings back and forth to mark out the time isn't a wheel at all. It's actually an anchor-shaped device that Jaeger-LeCoultre calls the Gyrolab, and it makes the watch more accurate during the whole life of the power reserve. There are 275 components in the movement in total.
The fact that you can get all this for less than $10,000 in stainless steel is pretty remarkable. Sure, 10 grand is still a good chunk of change—no two ways about that—but in the world of high-end mechanical watches, this is still squarely in the entry-level price bracket. Jaeger-LeCoultre is hoping that this will be able to steal some customers away from more common everyday watches, such as the Rolex Submariner and Omega Seamaster, acting as the brand's modern flagship.
There's also a more complicated model if that's more your speed. Its a true worldtimer called the Geophysic Universal Time. It comes in a 41.6 mm case and has a world map taking up most of the dial with the 24-hour time zone and cities rings around the edge, and it still has all the technical flourishes of the True Second. It's plenty cool, but for my money the True Second is the one to own. Jaeger plans on expanding the line even more over the coming years, making it a core part of the collection. I expect good things to come. 
The Geophysic True Second Date is priced at $9,050 in stainless steel and at $17,500 in pink gold, while the worldtimer models are $15,000 and $25,000, respectively. The watches will begin arriving at boutiques and customers on Oct. 1. 

=== Title: Monday Morning Find: Is This Funky Blue Tudor Submariner Better Than Its Rolex Cousin? - Bloomberg ===

The Rolex Submariner might be a near-perfect watch, but it's also ubiquitous. This blue Tudor Submariner with geometric snowflake-style hands gives you the best of its more well-known brother with a little more personality. 
While vintage Tudor watches are largely made from Rolex components (Tudor is a lower-priced alternative owned by Rolex), and you can even see the Rolex coronet logo on the crowns, casebacks, and bracelets in many cases, Tudor's designs have always been a little funkier. This 1970s Submariner has a bright blue dial and bezel as well as the unusually shaped "snowflake" hands.
You can see just how sharp the edges of the case are and how thin the chamfers are on the lugs, both signs of good quality. The tritium on the hands and dial have become a sort of soft Wisconsin cheddar color that's even throughout. Against the blue dial and faded blue bezel it looks even better than it would on black. The bold square markers and angular hour hand are the signature of this design and something totally unique to Tudor. This watch is the inspiration for the modern 
, too.
The bracelet on this model has slim folded links and a Tudor-branded clasp. Sure, the solid links in later bracelets are sturdier and objectively better made, but they're not nearly as charming or as comfortable (thanks to a satiny finish that develops over time). Counterintuitively, the Tudor clasp is actually rarer than the Rolex clasps that were often used during this period.
A few years ago the Tudor Submariner was considered a second-rate cousin of the Rolex Submariner, but that perception's long gone. There's a dedicated Tudor collector community, and in some cases a good snowflake Sub is even harder to find in good condition than a basic Rolex Sub. And it's not going to get any easier soon.

=== Title: Eight Incredible Dress Watches From Baselworld 2015 - Bloomberg ===

There's literally a watch for every type of person at the 
 watch expo. (Including the type you want to stay far, far away from.) For those who like a classier, more elegant timepiece, the brands this year are offering up a ton of new options that will look great with that bespoke jacket. Whether you're looking for a modest steel timekeeper or a full-on perpetual calendar, we've got you covered. Here are eight of the best dress watches from Baselworld 2015.
While Nomos has long had the Tangomat for those looking for an automatic alternative to the manually wound Tangente, it's always come at the expense of slimness. The Tangente Automatik uses a brand new ultrathin automatic movement, the DUW 3001, that incorporates Nomos's in-house escapement and is only .3mm thicker than the manual watch. The red accents on the dial look lovely and distinguish it just enough from its manual sibling. 
It's the 55th anniversary of Grand Seiko, so the Japanese watchmaker dug into the archive and designed this watch with details taken from the early models. The case has a slide tonneau curve to it, faceted lugs, and no bezel at all. It's a watch that's all about little subtleties, and those who get it will get it, and those do don't probably never will. In stainless steel (a limited edition of 600 pieces), it's wonderfully understated, but I couldn't blame you for reaching for one of the gold options (each color limited to 100 pieces).
This looks like a pure, classic dress watch. There's the moonphase tucked into the subdial at 6 o'clock, leaf-shaped hands, and an easy-to-read date at 12 o'clock. But Girard-Perregaux added its own twist by making the large date a composite of an opaque disk and a transparent disc (so it looks like one instead of two) and placing little slivers of luminous phosphorescence into the hands for reading at night. It's a slightly younger take on an old standby. 
It doesn't get much simpler than this. The slim steel case looks even slimmer because of its 42mm diameter, and the brushed metal dial has a slightly industrial-chic quality to it. The newly reworked Elite movement inside provides a startling 100 hours of power reserve and shows that Zenith can do more than just make edgy chronographs and big pilot's watches. 
Patek released more complicated watches than this one this week, but none as purely elegant. The TV-set shape might take some getting used to if you're not familiar with it, but after a few minutes it will seem as natural as a round watch. The full perpetual calendar is wound by a micro-rotor visible on the back, which is pure Patek, and the combination of black dial and white gold case makes it feel very 2015. You can keep your split-second chronographs and minute repeaters; this is the new Patek I'm dreaming of. 
The flashy Whatever Side of the Moon chronographs get all the attention at Omega (more on those later), but it's the Globermaster that the brand's most important watch. No question about it. The movement is anti-shock, anti-magnet, and anti-anything else you can think of and is the first Omega to achieve Master Chronometer certification. The 39mm size is close to perfect, and the pie-pan style dials (named for the sloping side that resemble, well, you know) are a throwback to vintage Omega dress watches. The Globemaster comes in a variety of metals and colors, so everyone can find one they like.  
This watch is a strange one, but I really like it. A lot of negative space is on the dial, the month indicator and seconds seem a little unbalanced, and the hands are whip thin. The 41mm case, on the other hand, is a little large and thick, but it wears better than I had expected. Snobs might scoff that the movement isn't made in-house by Georg Jensen, but design this good paired with an annual calendar priced at less than $6,000 deserves to be applauded. 
The Galet Square uses a curved cushion case (quite different from, say, 
), and it's the first nonround watch from former Patek maker Laurent Ferrier. There are a few dial colors, including gold, blue, and brown, with varying degrees of understated markings. Styling aside, it still uses Laurent Ferrier's micro-rotor movement, possibly the most beautiful automatic movement ever made. Rose gold is fine and all, but a watch this smart in stainless steel is pure cool. 

=== Title: Chronos Will Turn Any Watch Into a Smartwatch - Bloomberg ===

People who like watches tend to 
 like their watches. That means most aren't giving up their hard-won collections in favor of something digital. Smartwatches aren't just up for debate—they're not even part of the conversation. The Chronos device is one of the best attempts yet at addressing this gap.
 is a small metal disc that turns any watch into a smartwatch. It's just 33 mm across and 2.5 mm thick and weighs next to nothing. It's waterproof, and a microsuction surface on the back lets it adhere to the back of a watch, situating it between the mechanism and your wrist. Inside the Chronos is an array of sensors, a few LEDs, a vibration engine, and a battery, letting it add sort of ad-hoc smartwatch functionality to watches you already wear.
I've spent a week with a prototype, and the experience has been pretty good so far. Attaching it to the watch is as easy as putting on a sticker, and it pops right off when you get a fingernail under the edge. The seal is water resistant, and I didn't once worry about it coming off accidentally. The Chronos comes with an charging pad and should get about 36 hours of juice on a three-hour charge. Chronos says nothing in the device or the charger will magnetize your watch, so you don't have to remove the disc from your timepiece for charging.
I tried it on a few watches and found it most comfortable on those with flat casebacks and leather or fabric straps. Already domed or curved backs end up looking and feeling extra bubble-like with this on the back. Metal bracelets need to be adjusted to accommodate the extra girth. This won't be a huge deal if you wear the Chronos every day, but it would quickly get annoying for an occasional wearer.
The Chronos app is straightforward and the set-up process really easy. It prompts you to pair with the device and pulls in your health data from iOS's HealthKit. Steps, distance, active calories burned, and flights of stairs climbed are the main categories, and the interface is clean and easy to read, showing activity across the day in a ring. There will be some proprietary fitness tracking down the line, but for now it works seamlessly with Apple's native Heath app. Everything stays synched between the two, so you can also pass the Chronos data to other HealthKit compliant apps for such things as weight loss or particular kinds of athletic training. 
The other big function of Chronos is notifications. Chronos has really dug deep into iOS to make sure the experience is as rich as possible, and it has done a great job. Each type of notification can be assigned one of eight vibration patterns and one of six colors of LED flashes (or no lights at all). There are two tiers of notifications: person-specific and app-specific. For the former, you can assign a contact her own combination and get that vibration and flash whenever she contacts you, whether it's through a phone call, an e-mail, or a WhatsApp message. Apps can also get their own patterns, which will be the default unless a contact has a special pattern assigned. The breadth of natively integrated apps is great, including Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter all from launch.
There are also options for turning on gesture controls, letting you use the Chronos as a basic remote. Tapping your watch in different patterns lets you silence calls, skip music tracks, and activate your phone's camera remotely. These aren't things I find terribly compelling on most smart watches, and it's no different with the Chronos. These commands are still just way easier to do on your phone than with a strange series of taps.
Wearing the Chronos around, I found the notifications extremely useful. Simple things such as calendar alerts and message notifications are where smartwatches shine right now, and I liked that with Chronos, it was my wrist buzzing instead of my phone. I did, however, keep the LEDs off most of the time, since I got quite a few strange glances from friends at a bar one night when a text from a late arriver initiated a wrist-disco. While a true smartwatch such as the 
 or 
 often seems to be crying out for attention, the Chronos disappears except when it's giving you that nudge to grab your phone. 
For a lot of mechanical watch wearers, smartwatches have been a nonstarter so far, and most fitness trackers don't do a very good job with notifications and other nonfitness things. The Chronos offers watch lovers a lot of functionality in a slim package that won't interfere with the baubles they're already strapping to their wrists.
The Chronos is currently available for preorder via 
 for $99. The product will start being delivered to customers in spring 2016, when Chronos will also become available for general sale at $129. For now it works only on iOS, but an Android app should be ready by the time the product starts shipping.

=== Title: New Watch Wednesday: MB&F, Girard-Perregaux, and Arnold & Son Do What They Do Best - Bloomberg ===

Another week, 
 of watches. This group is an unusual mix that would rarely be seen or considered together, but they present an interesting picture of modern watchmaking. There are creators 
, which are dreaming up true works of art that also happen to keep time. Traditional watchmakers such as 
 are trying to keep centuries-old crafts alive while keeping them from feeling stale. Then there are innovators like 
, which push the bounds of what mechanical watchmaking can be in 2015.
All three put up strong efforts this week, creating watches I'd love to strap on (though certainly not at the same time).
Of all the wild creations from MB&F, the 
 might be the best known and most accessible. The two domes (one of hours and one for minutes), the huge exposed rotor, and the unique profile are all instantly recognizable. It's also the slimmest and most wearable of MB&F's watches, if that kind of thing matters to you. Now it's coming to an end: The MegaWind Final Edition will be a limited release of 25 pieces, and they'll be the last HM3s to leave MB&F's Geneva workshop.
The Final Edition has a blacked-out gold and titanium case, and the numerals on the time-telling domes are luminous. There are also SuperLuminova marks on the track under the blackened gold rotor, so as it spins you get a strobe effect. It's so cool, you'll find yourself flicking your wrist any time the lights get low (ignore the strange looks from people around you, they just don't get it). This is the end of an era at MB&F, but I'm already looking forward to seeing the next HM creation.
If you're not already paying attention to Girard-Perregaux, you've been missing out. The Swiss watchmakers definitely don't get the same amount of attention as Vacheron Constantin and Patek Philippe, but the brand makes true in-house movements and packages them with elegant cases and dials. The 
 (its model name, not vintage) is one of the great unsung modern watches, and 
 captures the same feeling in a more straightforward rendition.
At 38mm, this new model is smaller than previous 1966 watches and benefits greatly from the downsizing. It looks like a classic dress watch for purists, instead of an attempt to appease all customers at once. The radial lines on the guilloché dial line up with the hour markers, which will appeal to those of us who fall into the type-A column (or those who just appreciate attention to detail). Inside the pink gold case is an automatic in-house movement with a 46 hour power reserve, and you can check out all the high-end finishing through the sapphire caseback.
Arnold & Son doesn't mince words when it comes to naming its watches. 
 is short for Dial Side True Beat, a fitting name for a watch that shows off a true-beat seconds mechanism elevated above the dial. You're probably used to mechanical watches having a "sweep" seconds hand—a slight misnomer because it's not sweeping but ticking multiple times per second. A true-beat or dead-beat mechanism converts those multiple ticks into single, one-second pulses, letting the second hand tick like you'd see on a quartz watch. The DSTB lets you see the complication at work in the oversized seconds dial that floats above the main dial.
When the DSTB was released last year, it came t only in an elegant rose gold and grey color combination. This new version forgoes gold in favor of stainless steel and pairs it with a black dial that's more sleek than classic. It looks like a totally different watch, and the more modern color scheme fits the complication perfectly. It's a 250-piece limited edition, so there's still some exclusivity, but the new DSTB is one-third less expensive than the previous gold edition, opening the complication up to a new audience.

=== Title: TAG Heuer Connected Watch From Google and Intel: Specs - Bloomberg ===

The Swiss are now officially making a smartwatch. On Monday in New York City, TAG Heuer unveiled the Connected Watch, a $1,500 Android Wear smartwatch made in partnership with Google and Intel. It's the first true smartwatch from a Swiss luxury watchmaker, but can it solve 
?
The 
 is modeled after TAG's classic Carrera model, an auto racing timepiece that dates back to 1963. If you ignore the extremely generic name, the watch's profile and long lugs are quite recognizable to anyone familiar with TAG's watches. The case and buckle are designed and manufactured in Switzerland by the same team that makes the rest of TAG's watches, though the Connected Watch is not technically "Made in Switzerland" since the electronic guts come from Intel.
The Connected Watch is big at 46.2mm across and 12.8mm thick, but it's made of titanium, so it's surprisingly light. The bezel is marked in five-minute increments and has a black carbide coating that gives some contrast against the case's brushed and sandblasted surfaces. Paired with one of seven colors of vulcanized rubber strap and a matching titanium buckle, it looks and wears a lot like one of TAG's mechanical watches. From a distance it's nearly indistinguishable from 
. Still, though, I wish it were a lot smaller (maybe something closer to 42mm), and the fact that 
 tells me I'm probably not the only one.
Importantly, TAG developed the Connected Watch in partnership with Google and Intel, so electronics, aesthetics, and software features were all developed together. The project was 
, the watch industry's largest trade show, with executives from the three companies all present. The watch runs Google's Android Wear operating system and works with Android phones going all the way back to those running version 4.3 Jelly Bean and iPhones running iOS 8.2 or later.
It uses Bluetooth LE to connect to your smartphone, has Wi-Fi connectivity as well, and has 4 GB of onboard storage for apps and media. Gyroscopic sensors are there for basic fitness tracking, but like most competitors there is no GPS in the watch, so you will still need your smartphone nearby. The watch is also lacking a heart rate sensor and a speaker (yes, a speaker), so all notifications come through vibration. The watch will get up to 30 hours of battery life with normal use and comes with a USB charging cradle for powering up.
The TAG Heuer Connected Watch is explicitly a luxury smartwatch and it comes with a price tag to match. It will cost $1,500, making it more than four times the price of most other high-end Android Wear watches and in line with the likes of the 
. The Connected Watch is available at TAG's New York City boutique from noon on Nov. 9, with watches available at nine TAG Heuer boutiques and 19 retail partners across the U.S. and Canada on Nov. 10. International rollout will come over the next month.
For the premium price, TAG is offering additional features that most Android Wear watches cannot access. Owners register directly with TAG Heuer and gain access to a bunch of features not available to people sporting the latest Huawei or LG watches, including TAG Heuer watch faces, special timing apps, and apps that offer things like restaurant recommendations and let you track your golf game. In the coming months, TAG will also introduce watch faces designed with brand ambassadors, who include the likes of Tom Brady, Cara Delevingne, and Leonardo DiCaprio. For most users, these software features alone probably aren't worth the extra cost, but it does show TAG understands that with smartwatches the content is just as important as the hardware.
Now, one thing TAG can offer that none of its competitors can is a service it calls "connected to eternity." (Again, I don't know who's coming up with the names here, but they've got some serious work to do.) After two years, a Connected Watch owner can bring the watch into a TAG Heuer retailer, trade it in with an additional $1,500, and receive a mechanical TAG Heuer watch in return. Sure, it's not a one-for-one trade, but it's definitely a big step up over letting a $1,500 Connected Watch sit dormant in a drawer for the next decade after its software becomes obsolete, until you finally toss it in the garbage. 
Whether this is the right way for Swiss watchmakers to stay afloat over the coming decades is yet to be seen. The last time a relatively inexpensive alternative threatened mechanical watches, the industry made it through by splitting into fashionable commodity products like plastic Swatch watches and ultra-high-end luxury watches for connoisseurs. 
Either way, it shouldn't come as a surprise that TAG Heuer is leading the Swiss into battle against Apple and other smartwatch makers. Chief Executive Officer Jean-Claude Biver was largely responsible for the push into complicated and luxury watches in the 1980s, a time when the Swiss industry was all but dead after the emergence of inexpensive quartz watches from Japan. Along with Swatch founder Nicolas Hayek, he saved the industry from extinction.
The big question is, can he do it again?

=== Title: New Mexican Recipes, From Street Food to Michelin Worthy - Bloomberg ===

Mexican food is often liked more than it is appreciated, enjoying more popularity than respect.
That's starting to change as we learn more about the diversity of the country's regional cuisines and the layers of flavor that exist in authentic cooking.
Two new books should both serve to increase our understanding, though one centers on gastronomy while the other remains rooted in the streets.
First up is "Mexico From the Inside Out" ($59.95/£39.95), by Enrique Olvera, one of the most respected chefs not just in Mexico but also  in the world.
Olvera is classically trained. He was schooled in French cooking at the Culinary Institute of America in New York. When he opened 
 in Mexico City 15 years ago, he had no in-depth knowledge of his own country's gastronomy. He'd learned about rich sauces rather than salsas, more about pate than pibil.
Pujol has gone on to become Mexico's most exciting restaurant, and Olvera the star chef. Pulol is ranked No. 16 in the 
 awards. He achieved this by connecting with his country's food traditions: respecting the simplicity of street food while pushing culinary boundaries.
"Tacos, tamales, tortas, tortillas: If it starts with the letter T, it's like a vitamin to us," he writes in "Mexico From the Inside Out," which tells the story of his engagement with Mexican cuisine and features 65 recipes.
If you are trying the recipes at home, you might need to substitute the occasional ingredient. You probably won't need the detailed description of four types of worm, and you will be lucky if you can source many of the 24 varieties of chile.
One of Olvera's achievements at Pujol has been to elevate the taco from the streets to fine dining, starting with a better tortilla. He tried about 20 different types of corn, worked out the exact amount of dough for a flat, uniform tortilla and deduced the precise number of seconds it should fry.
"At Pujol, we don’t see the tortilla as a mere base for the taco, but as edible tableware, tailoring the tortillas to what we will top them with," he writes. Olvera will be serving his tacos in London next month at the Day of the Dead Festival with chef Thomasina Miers of 
.
Your needs might be simpler. (I enjoy the taco tray at 
restaurant in London, I like 
 and I'm irritated when people criticize 
.) Mexican food in London is
. If you just love the food, Tacopedia ($29.95/£19.95) by Deborah Holtz and Juan Carlos Mena may be for you.
This colorful book, originally published in Mexico, is based on five years of research. It's got just about every scrap of information you might want on tacos. But while it's encyclopedic in that sense, it's certainly not dull.
It's a celebration of the taco, almost comic book in style, with more than 100 recipes. There's history, there are restaurant recommendations, and the book is stuffed with facts like an overfilled tortilla. But most of all there is fun. The book even features an illustrated guide on how to eat a taco.
Enough words. Here are some recipes from the two books, starting with a salad from "Mexico From the Inside Out" and then two from Tacopedia.

=== Title: New Watch Wednesday: Mid-Winter Rush With Breitling, A. Lange & Söhne, Jaquet Droz - Bloomberg ===

During the window between 
 and Baselworld in March—or, as I like to call it, the "mid-winter rush"—brands are scrambling to get their new watches for the year in front of collectors (and, ahem, journalists) to gauge reactions while there's still time to make final tweaks before they go into full-scale production. Today we look at a robust vintage-inspired chronograph, a sleek dress watch, and an enamel-dialed nod to the 18th century. These three watches are perfect examples of taking an archetype and executing it with gusto (and have certainly got this journalist's attention).
Breitling fans tend to fall into one of two distinct camps: those who like rugged vintage chronographs and those who like shiny, blingy modern watches. For a brand with such a storied military and tool watch history, plus such incredible modern technology, Breitling often manages to pigeonhole itself into making what look like oversized fashion watches. The last few years it has slowly been adding watches to the lineup that recall its glory days to appeal to vintage enthusiasts. This is one of those watches.
The 
 is still modern-day huge (46mm across), but it has all the little details that make vintage Breitlings so great. The black bezel has bold markings for tracking a second time zone (with that red-tipped hand), the subdials are a creamy color instead of pure white, and the top 30-minute register has those six luminescent rectangles (vintage Breitling Co-Pilots only had five). A date window is white numbers on a black background, an understated yet great choice. Hey, Breitling, more of this please.
The black dial/white metal combination is the holy grail for most modern watch collectors. Whether it's platinum, white gold, or steel, white metal is a little less ostentatious than yellow or rose gold and can be more easily dressed up or down. Likewise, black dials can look sporty or dressy depending on how they're treated. The 1815 is Lange's flagship basic dress watch and this is the first time it's been offered in this coveted colorway—a 200-piece limited-edition run commemorating the 200th birthday of the brand's founder, Ferdinand Adolph Lange.
This is all to say that the folks in Glashütte, Germany, have figured out the perfect recipe for a 
: white metal case with slick black dial, 40mm case size that will appeal to a wide swath of people, an injection of big-number brand history, and all at a price that's relatively entry-level for A. Lange & Söhne. But the best part is that when the excited collectors calm down and the limited-edition race subsides, this will still be one hell of a watch.
Here, a deadbeat is actually a good thing, a mechanical wolf in sheep's clothing. Let me explain: The second hand on a quartz watch ticks in discrete seconds, while a mechanical watch's second hand appears to "sweep" since it moves a few times each second as the balance wheel swings back and forth in the movement. A so-called "deadbeat seconds" complication mimics that quartz-like ticking by storing up those multiple swings and then sending energy to the second hand in discrete bursts on each actual second, creating the same precise ticks on the dial. People who don't know much about watches might look at your wrist and assume there's a battery lurking in there somewhere, but you don't care about impressing those people anyway.
The large central second hand on the 
 is the perfect palette to show off this esoteric complication. The main dial up top and large date dial below form an eight (a preferred motif for Jaquet Droz) on the hard-fired enamel dial, which creates a creamy white dial with crisp black and red markings. It's a beautiful execution that nods to history without looking too antiquated. Under the hood is a silicon balance spring and a few nerd-baiting proprietary components that make the movement extremely accurate and reliable over time.

=== Title: Gender Neutral Kids Clothing Startups - Bloomberg ===

Ever since Jaya Iyer's daughter was a toddler, she had been fascinated by Saturn and its icy rings. When Swaha turned three, she had a space-themed birthday party. But when her mom went to find clothes with space images for Swaha, she couldn't find any. They were all in the boys section. 
So the 41-year-old mother of two, who has a doctorate in fashion merchandising, started her own business called 
 (which is how her daughter's name is pronounced) to sell clothes that upend gender stereotypes. One shirt features a grinning green stegosaurus, the plates on its back adorned with polka dots. A second comes in a blazing pink hue, with an astronaut planting an American flag on the moon. That one should satisfy her daughter. "She was very upset with me for not ever buying her anything with astronauts on it," Iyer says. "Then she started telling me: 'I want a ninja on my shirt.'"
Svaha is one of several startups that have emerged in recent years with the goal of changing the standards that govern what kids wear. These upstarts aren't looking to replace current kid's apparel entirely. Instead, their founders say they want to provide children with more options. 
 says it's all right for boys to wear pink and purple. 
 offers science-themed garb for girls. Perhaps the buzziest label is 
, which raised more than $200,000 in a successful Kickstarter campaign, showing demand for pirate-themed dresses and girl's apparel covered in the symbol for pi. Most of the ventures remain in early stages as online-only entities using crowdfunded or bootstrapped cash to sell small numbers of shirts or dresses. 
Several of the startups share a common origin: They were borne out of parental frustration with major retailers. Simply shopping in the opposite gender's section isn't the answer, these parents say. Cultural norms mean that as kids get older, designating certain items as male or female can confuse and frustrate them. A girl may not want to wear something designated for boys, and vice-versa. 
"Most kids and parents are going to the big retailers and seeing all these messages of what its means to be a boy or a girl," says Sharon Choksi, co-founder of clothing line 
. Choksi's daughter Maya, now 10, never liked sparkles or "feminine" colors, so the Choksis would shop for Maya in the boys' section. As Maya got older, Choksi worried that "boy" and "girl" labels would unnecessarily upset her daughter. 
Choksi, from Austin, started selling girl's shirts in 2013 before expanding into hoodies and shorts. In an effort to encourage girls to move around freely, the fit of Girls Will Be tops fall somewhere between a traditional, fitted girl's shirt and the boxy, looser fit typically marketed to boys. One design reads, “bold, daring, fearless, adventurous, so many things,” while another features a silhouette of a girl doing a flying sidekick. Choksi wants her clothes to fill a gap left open by big companies. "When are the big retailers going to wake up and realize that not all girls are the same and not all boys are the same?" she asks.
In Seattle, Martine Zoer had similar experiences with her sons. She grew tired of her boys, now four and seven, being pushed merchandise featuring designs of dinosaurs and trucks. In 2014, she founded 
, a label devoted to gender-neutral clothes. "There's nothing wrong with pink or girls liking pink," Zoer says. "But if we only offer them that choice, there's something wrong with that."
“There’s nothing hardwired in our brains that says pink is for girls and blue is for boys,” says Lise Eliot, a neuroscientist at the Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Frank University and author of 
. It’s purely a cultural phenomenon. By the time children are toddlers, Eliot says, boys start rejecting pink because they realize it may diverge from what's expected. 
These apparel choices can have enduring repercussions by affecting kids' interests and long-term goals. For instance, since most female clothes are more fitted, they often double as restraints, Eliot says, pushing girls away from physical activities. Kids' play habits matter, because they affect development and ultimately, even what career they end up embracing. If a girl is tugged away from liking outer space by societal pressures, she probably won't veer toward an aerospace profession later in life. If a boy is discouraged from playing with dolls and wearing bold clothes, they may not want to get into fashion design one day. "They see it's the boys with the rocket ships and the girls with the pretty flowers," adds Eliot.
At major retail outlets such as Children's Place and Gymboree, there are few, if any, options for the girl who loves dinosaurs or football. Same goes for the boy who loves unicorns and hearts. Much of the merchandise is as stereotyped as can be: a T-Rex playing football in the boys section; a shirt that reads "I ❤ My B.F.F. More Than Shoes" in the girls section. A representative for Children's Place declined to comment on how it decides what designs and colors to sell boys and girls, and representatives for Gymboree did not respond to a request for comment. 
Big retailers are typically focused on quantity, so until enough shoppers demand clothes that don't fall along traditional lines, not much will change, says Patty Leto, senior vice president of childrens' wear at the Doneger Group, a trend intelligence firm. "Pink is always going to sell for girls and blue is always going to sell for boys, no matter what is going on out there with small labels," she says. In the end, it's up to the parents. "The consumer is the ultimate voter here," she says.
Take Lands' End, which in 2014 found itself under attack by angry shoppers when New Jersey mom Lisa Ryder wrote a letter decrying stereotypes in its clothing selection. Flipping through a catalog, Ryder's daughter loved shirts with planets and dinosaurs, though they were clearly marked for boys. When it was suggested to Ryder by a Facebook commenter that she simply purchase a boy's shirt, 
 with vigor. "The problem is that your recent catalog copy and product offerings strongly promote the gender stereotypes that young boys are smart and mighty and young girls are adorable," she wrote. "Simply buying my daughter one of your 'boy shirts' is not the answer because it perpetuates the idea that science is a boy thing that she happens to be participating in." Lands' End decided to release new science-themed shirts for girls.
For the giants of the clothing world, it's an exercise in figuring out what will sell. For the budding brands, it's less a race for revenue than a mission to make a difference. "Everybody's really supportive of each other, rather than being competitive," Zoer, the Quirkie Kids founder, says of the community of new brands. "We're all sort of in this together."

=== Title: Apple Watch Gets First Major Updates, Including Partnership With Hermès - Bloomberg ===

Apple hosted Wednesday's product release event one year to the day after it first announced Apple Watch, and the watch got its first round of updates on its first anniversary. There are a few new accessories, two new metal colors, and a partnership with luxury brand Hermès.
Apple began its watch announcements with the splashiest. For the Apple Watch Hermès, Apple partnered with the French luxury brand to create leather straps for the standard stainless steel model and a trio of special watch faces that recall Hermès's traditional watches. Prices range from $1,100 for a single wrap strap to $1,500 for a watch with a full leather cuff, and the straps come in a variety of colors including black, red, tan, and blue. These watches will be limited to select retail stores, will come packaged in Hermès' signature orange color boxes, and go on sale sometime in October.
There are also now rose gold and gold-colored anodized aluminum Apple Watch Sport models, which let customers get a look similar to the $10,000-plus Apple Watch Edition starting at a friendlier $349 price point. These watches will come paired with new colors of fluoroelastomer straps, which add softer, more muted colors, including navy, lavender, stone, and blush, to the black, white, and various neon colors on offer now. Apple has also added new colors of leather bands for the standard Apple Watch, as well as a special Product Red stainless steel Apple Watch paired with a bright red strap (a portion of the proceeds go to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS). Prices still range from $349 to $17,000, and these new models begin shipping Wednesday in 24 countries.
 
Apple also announced that 
, the first major update to the Apple Watch's operating system, will be available Sept. 16. The biggest change is that third-party applications will now be able to run natively on the watch itself, instead of being relegated to the iPhone. This will improve performance and will also allow app makers to tap into the watch's sensors and data directly. There are currently more than 10,000 watch apps, and with these new capabilities, such major players as Facebook Messenger and GoPro will be joining the fray.
Developers will also be able to integrate their apps into watch faces as complications, or the little widgets that accompany the time. In addition, the update adds a few new watch faces, deeper integration with Siri, and a new nightstand mode that lets you use the watch as an alarm clock, along with enhancements to core functions such as letting you reply to e-mails and manage larger sets of contacts.
Since the Apple Watch first burst onto the scene in April, smartwatch competition has heated up. Less than two weeks ago, Google announced that 
, opening up a lot more options for those in the Apple ecosystem. And just last week Motorola unveiled a stylishly updated 
 and Samsung announced the round 
.  
Apple has still declined to release any official sales number for the Apple Watch, grouping sales data with that from iPods, Beats headphones, and other smaller products. During Apple's quarterly earnings call on July 21, Chief Eecutive Tim Cook rejected reports that watch sales peaked at launch and had been declining ever since, saying that June was the watch's strongest month.

=== Title: James Bond: Spectre Premiere Showcases Premium Brands - Bloomberg ===

Bond films are some of the most heavily branded in movie history, with companies paying millions to get their products on screen alongside the world's most famous spy. The latest instalment, Spectre, has its world premiere in the U.K. on Monday.
With Bond-themed ad campaigns and pre-release hype in full-swing, Seesaw Media's Daryl Collis explains that the link between brands and Bond is deep and long-standing, but not a relationship that the viewer will always accept without question.
Pierce Brosnan's Bond swansong Die Another Day saw producers link up with 21 "brand partners." By the time of Daniel Craig's debut in Casino Royale that number had been pared back to seven.
Bond now promotes "brand partners who are more real, and more authentic to his [Craig's] interpretation of James  Bond," says Collis.
For more on Bond and brands, watch the video above.
Meanwhile, here are some of the numbers behind what is set to be one of the biggest films of the year:
 
Spectre cost over $300 million to make, according to 
 from 2014. That makes it nearly twice as expensive as Skyfall - the previous Bond film in the long-running franchise, which cost between $150 million to $200 million. However, Sony Pictures need not be too worried about Spectre’s budget if the box office revenue is anything like Skyfall’s, which

With a runtime of 148 minutes, Spectre is the longest Bond film of all time. The second longest was

 joint fifth. If for some reason you were to watch the five longest Bond films in one sitting, it would take you 719 minutes.
 
Although it can’t be confirmed, it appears that Bond may have done away with his trusty Walther PKK in favour of Heckler & Koch’s 15-shot VP9, a similar gun produced by a rival firm. Promotional images show Bond brandishing the new weapon, which costs $719, making it more expensive than the

Bloomberg reporters Richard Weiss and Luca Casiraghi note that

James Bond has worn an Omega Seamaster for over 20 years and Spectre’s 007 is no exception to the tradition. The 
 is the first time that a watch worn by Bond has also been officially released to the general public as a limited edition purchase. The black-dialed timepiece sports a rare “lollipop” second hand in addition to a black ceramic “bi-directional bezel ring,” which looks suitably dark and spy-like. If you opt for the NATO strap, 
 on the bracelet strap holder (not a particularly James Bond thing to do). The watch costs more than $6,000.

=== Title: Why Nest CEO Tony Fadell Loves Old-School Mechanical Watches - Bloomberg ===

When Nest Labs Chief Executive Officer Tony Fadell isn't 
, he collects watches. It shouldn't come as a surprise; someone who spends all day solving engineering problems and agonizing over the design of smarthome products should logically be interested in tiny mechanical gadgets that are painstakingly assembled and decorated by hand. But Fadell doesn't just like watches. He has a seven-figure collection, and, more important, he really 
 watches. I spoke with Fadell about what keeps him interested in timekeeping, how his collecting impacts his work at Nest, and what he thinks many collectors don't quite appreciate enough. Here's a hint: Leave the bling at home.
 Beside the Mickey Mouse I got as a little kid, I didn’t start wearing watches until I was in my 20s. When I finally took notice of watches, it was when I was in a design store that happened to carry watches, too. The watch was an Ikepod. I thought it was an interesting design and something very different. I caught the bug. 
 
Well, I didn’t buy that watch right away. It was a very expensive watch. Especially when I was in my 20s, it wasn’t an impulse buy. It was the thing that started to sensitize me and I started noticing what people were wearing, and I started looking in store windows as I'd walk by. From there I’d start to notice the details.
The next watch I noticed was a 
. It didn’t look like anything I’d seen before. It was simple, bold, and I was like “Wow, I have to have that." That was my first real purchase. I bought an 
 after that.
For me, it’s the amount of engineering and design it takes to make these very delicate things work in all kinds of crazy conditions. Whether that’s underwater, withstanding shocks or magnetism, and making sure that an automatic watch keeps running as your wrist moves. The amount of time, testing, and care it takes to pull you off, for something on the inside, it's just astonishing. There's also the innovation in the mechanisms themselves. Whether that’s a silicon escapement or different types of metals that are anti-magnetic or low friction. For all of this to work uninterrupted for years is really astounding.
Especially new modern men's watches, they’re much more about ego and jewelry than they are about the watch functions. You should just go get a fancy bracelet if you want a fancy bracelet. Guys are trying to justify getting a more ostentatious piece of jewelry by saying it’s a watch. But you look at it and say, “I can’t even read it! I don’t know what time it is!” To me, when I look at a lot of these watches, I think of guys running around with their hoods torn off the fronts of their cars or neon underneath their cars. It has nothing to do with the car at all, it has to do with an “Everyone, hey, look at me” attitude. I am highly turned off by that stuff.
I think that it’s not just for Nest but for other mobile products, too. If you look at the amount of different materials—titanium, ceramic, PVD-coated steel—there are so many materials in the watch world that we would love to bring over to the mobile world. Scaling something from watches to consumer electronics is hard, especially when it comes to volumes. I’m always looking at all that stuff, but which ones connect to work can vary. 
You always strive for positive emotional tactility. When you press something, you think “Oh, that feels great.” We try to do that with all the Nest products. That’s why there’s a stainless steel ring on the outside of the thermostat. It feels really good and it’s brushed with the same kind of quality you’d brush a watchcase with.
The Android team is working with LVMH on that. I just peer in on that stuff. I’m not actively working on it. I’m curious and I talk to the people working on it, but I’m not working on it.
Patek is the legend of the industry. It has the tradition, the movement history, it’s always been striving and has a great blend of timelessness as well as mechanics. It’s been the leader for so long in so many ways. When you look at Lange, it’s a new brand. They have a lot of the same characteristics of a Patek, but they don’t have to play to that traditional audience. They’re playing to a newer, hipper audience that still wants to see things that reference a classic style while innovating in areas like interfaces and displays.
Yes, I think so. I think any watch you put on makes a statement, and Lange's statement is “I appreciate the classics, but I’m buying a modern classic that’s going to be timeless in 100 years.” When you buy a Patek, many of their styles are 50 or 100 years old and you’re buying a new version of something that’s been around. It’s two ways of looking at the market. Here in Silicon Valley we’re always pushing for the latest, the newest, and the next thing that’s going to be changing the world, not just today but 10, 20 years from now. That’s what resonates with this crowd.
There are three really bold things that have been shown recently. One is 
, which has the ability to shake up the watch market even more than quartz did back in they day. [
] Quartz offered one thing, but now mechanical watches are accessible and are combining mechanics with fashion.
On the other side, I look at something like the 
 that uses vacuums to get very long power reserves and accuracy. It has a see-through crystal case that’s really novel, and it’s an incredible watch throughout. It’s a totally different way to think about building watches.
Then there are innovative styles, new ways of looking at time. 
 has its own thing [
], and you could say this appeals even more to the Silicon Valley crowd. It’s not a classic design.
The Cartier ID 2 or something related to it. You can’t get it. Cartier isn’t selling it.
I’m trying to! It’s not without effort. I’m not just wishing, I’m putting in effort! But so far it’s been futile. We’ll see what happens—it’s not over yet.

=== Title: Is This the Original Smartwatch? Tiffany's Pulsar: Monday Morning Find - Bloomberg ===

Don't talk to me about your Casio Calculator watch being the original smart watch. When electronic watches were still in their infancy and portable screen technologies were nearly nonexistent, there was the Pulsar.
This vintage find is a Pulsar model P2, also called the Astronaut. Pulsar made a lot of these so-called "computer watches" in the early '70s, with the P2 arriving in 1972. By tapping the button on the side of the case (where a crown would normally be), the wearer could light up the red LED diodes to display the time. Roger Moore notably sports a P2 at the beginning of the James Bond movie 
, forgoing the Rolex Submariner worn by Sean Connery. Today the watch looks a little kitschy, but in the early 1970s it must have looked as if it had arrived from the space age.
Without a crown, you're probably wondering how to set the Pulsar P2. This is where things get really weird.
The back of the watch has two little, carved-out sections marked "Min." and "Hr."—you know, for minutes and hours—but the case is entirely sealed for waterproofing purposes. Under these indentations are little magnetic switches for adjusting the time, and a magnet is concealed in the bracelet's clasp for activating them. You slide the horseshoe-shaped magnet out of the clasp and then tap the indentations until the watch is showing the time you want. (Making the future was hard back then.)
What really makes this Pulsar special, though, is where it was sold. This wasn't something an Isaac Asimov fan bought in a hobby shop. It was purchased through a jeweler who carried it alongside other products from 
. You can see the signature clearly on the lower left portion of the plexiglass, in white. While 
 always raise suspicion, this watch comes with the original paperwork (marked "Tiffany & Co." under "Brand") and the original watch box, so you don't have to worry.
The early 1970s were a difficult time for the watch industry. Many people thought mechanical watchmaking was dead with the invention of mass-produced quartz watches; a lot of watch brands went out of business, and other had to make massive changes to survive. Even 
 in making high-end versions of quartz watches, with the Beta 21. Watches such as this are little time capsules that hearken back to that era, when the balancing act of tradition and progress wasn't yet sorted out. With all the talk of smartwatches today, a watch like this seems more relevant than ever.

 TAG Heuer will start selling a smartwatch for about $1,400 in October or November as the brand becomes Apple Inc.’s biggest Swiss competitor for connected timepieces.

=== Title: This Vintage Rolex With Anti-Magnetic Powers Was Made for Atomic Scientists - Bloomberg ===

Sometimes Rolex does something weird, and that's when you really need to pay attention.
The first Milgauss was introduced in 1956 and was a very different watch from the one you see here. It had a lightening bolt-shaped hand, a textured black dial, and a big black bezel marked with numbers one through six around the edges. It might just be the strangest watch Rolex ever made. It was designed for scientists working at the CERN physics research lab in Geneva and so had anti-magnetic properties for accurate timekeeping around heavy magnets and machinery.
 
This is the Milgauss reference 1019 produced from 1960 until 1988, when the watch was discontinued (until its 2007 revival). There are a few variations on this archetype, including a variant with a black dial and even a few different styles of markers on the dial, but the important features are the same across the range.
The case is a larger 38-millimeter case, in the style of the 36mm case used for the Datejust and 
. It doesn't have the beveled edges on the lugs, and the flat, smooth bezel gives the watch a distinct look. The hour and minute hands are wide and have slices of luminous paint in the middle, while the second hand is razor-thin with a bright red, arrow-shaped tip. The hour markers are stick-shaped with luminous dots on the outer edges, except for the markers at three, six, and nine o'clock, which are double-width with luminous fill in the middle. No other Rolex looks anything like the Milgauss.
But what makes the watch truly special is the anti-magnetic protection. Underneath the usual screw-down caseback is a secondary cover. This so-called "dust cover" is actually a Faraday Cage, protecting the movement from up to 1,000 Gauss of magnetism (hence Mil-Gauss for the name). Magnetism can destroy a watch's ability to keep accurate time by distorting the metal coil that beats out the seconds, exerting extra force on delicate components, and more. If you're a scientist working with particle accelerators, a little protection is a must.
Since 1970, when this was produced, magnets have proliferated in our daily lives. Everything from your computer to your phone to the bag you probably keep both in contains magnets of some kind. We're no longer stuck using mechanical timekeepers for critical tasks these days, but you'd still like your watch to be mostly accurate. The watch industry at large has invested heavily in developing ways to use such materials as silicium and non-ferrous metals in watches to eliminate altogether the dangers presented by magnets.

=== Title: Cartier Just Made Its Most Complicated Watch Ever, and It Is Gorgeous - Bloomberg ===

This is about as far from a two-handed Tank watch as you can get. Cartier's fine watchmaking department has been making consistent strides every year, adding more technical developments to the maison's arsenal. This year is no exception. The Rotonde de Cartier Grande Complication Skeleton is the most complicated watch Cartier has ever produced. 
The Rotonde de Cartier Grande Complication contains a perpetual calendar, minute repeater, and flying tourbillon, all in a highly skeletonized movement. All the complications are clearly laid out and visible, with the tourbillon at 12 o'clock, the minute repeater's hammers at six o'clock, and the perpetual calendar indications floating above the movement components on round dials. Cartier has produced some serious watches over the last few years, but this is the most complex so far. Take it all in:
From the front, the movement components peek through the sparse dial, which is a trio of round segments for the calendar and two large horn shapes to support them and frame the tourbillon. It's striking and clearly meant to impress. Legibility is always compromised with skeletonzied watches, and the Grande Complication is tough to read unless you get the lighting just right. The blued hands help, but you still get lost sometimes.
There's a sense of anticipation when you turn the watch over, but the movement looks a little dense and cluttered from the rear. There are so many components in so little space that even though each piece is finished nicely, the overall effect is muddled. If you don't look closely, you might even miss the micro-rotor winding system toward the top right. 
Cartier calls the watch "ultra-thin," a vague description often thrown out as if it's a qualification that can be achieved if a watch meets specific criteria. It's not. Any company can call any watch ultra-thin.  That said, the caliber 9406 MC movement is only 5.94mm thick with 578 components, and the 45mm platinum case is 12.6mm thick. Making it thinner would have disrupted the signature proportions of the Rotonde de Cartier case and bezel. As far as I'm concerned, this watch qualifies as ultra-thin with room to spare.
Since 2005, Carole Forestier-Kasapi has been director of movement creation at Cartier, where she's done everything from developing basic movements in-house for Cartier's entry level products to engineering watches like this. And she's done it all as a French woman in a climate that tends to frown upon anyone who's neither Swiss nor male. 
What Forestier-Kasapi and her team have achieved by creating watches like this shows they're not content to rest on a storied heritage of watchmaking. (Although Cartier is more often thought of as a jewelry brand, it loves to promote the fact that it's been making watches for more than a century.)
A great history is meaningless if you don't keep pushing forward with the same level of dedication and pride. If you take your foot off the gas, or make advancements that don't bring value to your customers, you're wasting everyone's time. The prowess displayed in watches like this trickles all the way down to Cartier's most basic mechanical watches, so you don't have to spend half a million dollars to benefit from the company's advances. And those who do want to invest in something like the Grande Complication Skeleton will help to keep watchmaking interesting for another century by keeping Cartier on its toes. 
The Rotonde de Cartier Grande Complication Skeleton is limited to 50 numbered pieces, priced at $620,000 each.

=== Title: Manhattan's Baccarat Hotel Aims for Iconic With Chevalier Restaurant - Bloomberg ===

Just across the street from the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan’s Midtown, you can go and sip cocktails from diamond-cut Baccarat tumblers, under the cool light of a crinoline Baccarat chandelier, then ride the elevator up for a disco nap in your Baccarat suite.
Baccarat has manufactured crystal glassware in northeastern France for the past 250 years, but last month, in a gigantic feat of international lifestyle branding, the company opened 
.
It’s a swanky palace built out on the first 12 floors of a split-level tower, with 114 rooms of varying grandeur and a spa run by Estée Lauder-owned cosmetic company La Mer. When the 80-seat restaurant 
 (currently in its soft opening) opens on April 13, it will fall toward the posher end of the brasserie spectrum, with Executive Chef Shea Gallante in the kitchen.
You might not even notice Charles Masson, what with the towering chocolate soufflés, the glittering crystal, and the flashy 
 design of the hotel. The 60-year-old Frenchman in a pressed white shirt, jacket, and gleaming polished shoes is Chevalier’s director, managing the front of the house. “I like to be discreet,” he tells me over the phone, “because the highest level of service is discretion.”
But Charles Masson has noticed you.
Masson is a legend in the restaurant scene and the former general manager of New York’s 
. He’s also one of the last managers in New York to practice a particular style of French service—elegant, composed, and yeah, a little bit old-fashioned—and he’s in demand. His old regulars have already stopped by for visits.
“It’s very touching,” he says. “Very moving.”
When his father fell ill, and Masson was just 19 years old, he moved to New York to help run his parents’ French restaurant. He went on to do so for the next 40 years. Masson’s parents had opened La Grenouille in 1962, in the middle of a snowstorm, with just a few red roses on the tables and old linoleum floors, upgrading the place slowly but surely until it became one of the city’s great French restaurants—and a bastion of luxury.
Life is more beautiful when Masson is around. For one thing, there are always fresh flowers in water. Different water for different flowers, because Masson knows about these things: Peonies like it sugary and cool; larkspurs need a little dose of alcohol to feel perky; daisies thrive with peppermint oil; and big, tough birds of paradise take well to a small dilution of vinegar. Masson published a small book on the subject dedicated to his father, called simply
It’s
a must-read for anyone looking to extend the life of their delphiniums, or to understand the care that goes into a bouquet. By 1984, La Grenouille was spending more than $80,000 a year on fresh flowers. 
“When you get to know your guests, it becomes very personal,” says Masson, talking people, not flowers. “You really anticipate the needs of your clientele, and it’s never ‘one size fits all,’ ever.” 
Masson’s family restaurant stands and continues to serve quenelles—the melt-away dumplings of poached pike mousse—under silky pashminas of Champagne sauce and caviar. But Masson’s younger brother Philippe took over as general manager last year, after Charles 
 under what he still refers to as “painful circumstances.” 
It seemed like the end of another New York micro-era (and it was), but Masson’s new post at Baccarat indicates a comeback, and a major investment in the old school of Gallic finesse.
At Chevalier, Masson says he anticipates spending $80,000 to $100,000 on the arrangements each year, shopping at the flower market on 28th Street a few times a week. But he says the most important thing for his new team to get right will be, when it’s good, completely invisible: the excellent service of a synchronized kitchen and front of house, as well as genuine hospitality.
“You could have the most beautiful flowers, the most beautiful chandeliers, but if you don’t have the spirit to serve, and the humility to serve, then it’s not the kind of restaurant I’d like to frequent or work in,” he explains.
Baccarat was a particularly good place for Masson to wind up. There are some cosmically perfect coincidences that can make a publicist’s knees go wobbly—sweeter than marketing materials, stranger than fiction. For Masson it involves an expensive vase that his father bought many decades ago, when the family was still operating on a shoestring budget but reaching for more. It was the first of many stunning crystal pieces that would be filled with flowers each day and come to define the elegance of La Grenouille. 
“It was the most magnificent Baccarat vase,” says Masson, “and it happened to be a Chevalier design.” 

=== Title: Here’s What It’s Like to Shop for an Apple Watch - Bloomberg ===

The 
, and on Friday Apple's Watch officially goes on sale around the globe. Here's everything you need to know to secure yours.
There will be three ways to experience the Apple Watch in the store. The most casual is the display table, a glass-topped case that contains the different models (with the strap and color options) on show side by side. If you want a quick glance, you'll be able to scan the collection, hopefully without too much of a wait. The next level is the demo table, which will be similar to how you're used to experiencing Apple products in-store. Watches will be tethered to tables, and you'll get to touch the hardware and play with the software. Finally, there are separate demo tables where, by appointment, you can have an Apple associate help you try on the Sport and standard Apple Watch in various incarnations.
At 12:01am Pacific Time on April 10 (3:01am ET), preorders will open on Apple.com, much as they have with previous editions of the iPhone. What will be different is they will not be available in stores in the morning and won't even ship until April 24. In addition to buying the Apple Watch, you'll be able to schedule in-store, try-on appointments online, much as you'd make a Genius Bar appointment. 
If it's the Apple Watch Edition you're looking for, try-on appointments for the gold version take place in a separate try-on area from the Sport and standard Apple Watch. The experience will include personal setup assistance and will last a little longer than a standard appointment. Only select stores will be carrying the Edition, and a list is yet to be released.
Overall it appears that Apple is trying to accommodate everyone from the casual onlooker to the must-have buyer, each in a different space to avoid making the launch a nightmare for customers and employees. Crowds are expected, but unlike previous launches, massive lines of people won't be waiting to purchase watches—there's nothing in the stores to walk away with.
Apple locations will be rolling out the new furniture overnight (and 24-hour stores will close to do so). In New York, all the stores will open simultaneously at 9 a.m. to welcome guests with the very first appointments for those try-on tables. You don't need an appointment for the try-on tables, but if you don't have one, you could get caught waiting a while for the next open slot when you arrive in the store.
You won't be able actually to buy the watch in the store in the early days. You'll have to place your order online when you get home (or, if you're not too discreet with your credit card info, you can hop on one of the dozens of computers already in the stores). Apple is not commenting on whether this will end April 24 when the watches begin shipping.

Restaurants are like buses.
OK, they don't move, you don't need an 
, they are not filled with people whose headphones leak audio swill, you are not routinely required to stand and their main purpose isn't transportation.
Apart from that, it is a really useful analogy.
You wait around for one to arrive and then a fleet shows up. Several (restaurants, not buses) are on their way in coming weeks and now is a good time to try for a table. Many serve reduced-price food for a few days before the official date, which may change at the last minute, so it's worth asking if there's a soft opening.
 promises that this new brasserie is going to bring back some old-fashioned glamor. It replaces the Fountain, which occupied the ground-floor space at the back of the posh store for more than 60 years. It will be open from 7 a.m. until late, serving everything from breakfasts to after-theater suppers. It will feature burnt-orange leather banquettes in the center, with booths set against the front and back walls, plus a marble-fronted bar.
Restaurant imports from France often get a rough ride in London, where Le Chabanais (for example) lasted only a matter of weeks. This outpost of a Parisian brasserie looks set to do better. The main selling point is that 110 wines will be served by the glass in a city where diners tend to be thirsty. Les 110 de Taillevent will be open all day, starting with breakfast. The interiors of this high-ceilinged establishment in a former bank on Cavendish Square are beautiful.
This is the latest outpost of a mini-chain that references the Irani cafes of old Bombay. It's right next to Carnaby Street. While Dishoom is expanding, the quality of design, food and service is unchanged. Just be prepared to queue, even though this is a large site at more than 7,000 square feet. Dishoom is wildly popular and doesn't take reservations for dinner, unless you are in a group of six or more. The prices are low and the energy level is high.
This new European restaurant occupies an historic building next to King's Cross Station. It was constructed in 1865 for the German Gymnastics Society and hosted indoor events for the 1866 Olympic Games. The dramatic and cavernous space will house a restaurant, a brasserie and a bar. It's the latest project of 
, whose restaurant empire includes Coq d'Argent, Le Pont de la Tour and Quaglino's.
This informal and exciting new café in Soho will serve snacks from south India, particularly hoppers (a bowl-shaped pancake made with fermented rice batter and coconut milk) and dosas (crepes made from fermented batter of ground rice and lentil). The prices are restrained while the flavors let rip. This is the latest opening from the owners of 
. Their previous Asian street-food restaurant, 
, is usually rammed, with a queue.
This is the monster new establishment of Alan Yau, the restaurateur who created 
 and 
. It occupies a site in Mayfair that at one time was fronted by Automat, behind which was a club that was underground in every sense.  Yau describes it as a lifestyle and entertainment venue, rather than as a plain old restaurant. There will be a house band (Eight Clouds of Joy) and a string quartet. Park Chinois, serving a Chinese menu, will be open all day, including for afternoon tea. If you will forgive me a little hyperbole, it sounds amazing.
This Asian fish and seafood restaurant on Berkeley Square looks a million dollars, and that's only a fraction of what it cost to create. The beautiful and lavish décor is just the start of what promises to be a dramatic place to eat and drink. This has as much buzz as anywhere that is about to open, and dinners are already booked out weeks ahead. It is the latest project of Caprice Holdings, whose establishments include the Ivy and the Caprice.
Yoshihiro Murata is one of the most respected chefs in Japan, where he holds a total of seven Michelin stars. He is the third-generation chef-owner of Kikunoi, in Kyoto.  At Tokimeite, in Mayfair, he plans to serve modern cuisine informed by hundreds of years of tradition. He's backed here by the Zen-Noh Group, the business arm of Japan's largest agricultural cooperative, which means he should be able to serve beautiful Japanese wagyu beef .

=== Title: Vacheron Constantin Celebrates 260 Years With an Exciting, New 'Harmony' Line of Watches - Bloomberg ===

When it comes to wristwatches, history is serious business. Vacheron Constantin was founded in 1755, making it the oldest continuously operating watch manufacturer in the world. It weathered the fall of European monarchies, a pair of world wars, and the watch industry's so-called "Quartz Crisis" of the 1970s and 80s—and the brand's current custodians aren't going to let you forget it. To celebrate the company's 260th anniversary this year, Vacheron Constantin has unveiled the "Harmony" collection, a group of cushion-shaped watches ranging from a simple dual-time number to a monster chronograph that sets a new world record.
The particulars of this line of watches vary, but the new cushion case shape is the Harmony line's signature. Designing a balanced cushion case is a delicate matter; if it's too round, it can look like a square watch that had a little too much fondue for dinner, but if it's too angular it appears rough and unfinished. The Harmony case really nails this balancing act, particularly with the short curved lugs and the proportion of the dial opening to the bezel width. At 42 millimeters across, the men's chronographs are a little large for my tastes, but the 40mm men's dual time and 37mm women's watches felt great on the wrist.
There is a total of eight watches in the collection: a monopusher split-seconds chronograph, a monopusher chronograph with a tourbillon, a monopusher chronograph with a pulsometric scale, a chronograph for women, and a trio of dual-time watches. I'll give you a second to take that all in. The four new movements used across the range are designed and manufactured entirely in-house and it took Vacheron seven years to develop them. The final watches all bear the Geneva Hallmark, meaning they meet rigorous quality and finishing standards, in addition to being made in the Canton of Geneva. These watches aren't messing around.
My favorite of the bunch is actually the simplest of the chronographs, the straightforward monopusher ($75,300, limited to 260 pieces). The pulsometer scale around the edge of the dial was used by doctors to measure patients' heart rates and is a favorite among vintage collectors. Sure, the other complications might be more technically ambitious, but this is the one I want on my wrist right now. It's elegant, simple, and allows you to enjoy the new case shape and traditional dial layout without any distractions.
The platinum Harmony Ultra-Thin Grande Complication split-seconds chronograph ($369,200, limited to 10 pieces) is the most ambitious of the collection. It's powered by the calibre 3500 movement, which, at only 5.2mm thick, is the thinnest automatic split-seconds chronograph on the planet. Sure, that's shaving things pretty fine, but it's still an impressive feat. Watches such as this are usually manually wound so you can admire the mechanics through the caseback (an automatic watch's winding rotor usually covers the movement) but the calibre 3500 uses a peripheral rotor to keep the view clear while providing the convenience of automatic winding. Incredible movement aside, the watch is elegant, well-appointed, and looks a lot like the 1920s chronographs that inspired its creation.
While the Harmony Tourbillon Chronograph ($314,600, limited to 26 pieces) is technically wonderful, it fails to achieve the same aesthetic cohesiveness of the other Harmony watches. The large tourbillon carriage is meant to add wow factor but instead just looks oversized, and the 45-minute counter overlaps with the tourbillon aperture in a way that misses the 
 mark. If you like tourbillons, you're probably drooling over the Harmony Tourbillon Chronograph already, but for me this watch is the least exciting of the bunch.
The women's chronograph ($71,200, limited to 260 pieces) is not a monopusher, using the more traditional two-button layout. While it doesn't have an entirely new movement inside, the caliber 1142 is an enhanced version of an existing Vacheron movement that now has the Geneva Hallmark certification and a slightly faster 3 Hz balance wheel. The 37mm size is perfect for this case shape, and my only gripe is that there isn't a version without diamonds that I could wear myself.
Rounding out the collection are the three dual-time Harmonies, two for men ($43,800, limited to 625 pieces each in rose and white gold) and one for women ($50,600, limited to 500 pieces). These are the simplest of the Harmony watches, but they are extremely practical and a nice alternative if you're not a chronograph person. Again, women don't get an option without a diamond bezel, which is a bit of a shame, though the diamond model might be the most competitively priced watch here.
Overall, the Harmony collection is an impressive effort from Vacheron Constantin and it will be exciting to watch the range grow in non-limited editions over the coming years. Developing three monopusher chronograph movements, one with split-seconds and one with a tourbillon, plus a dual-time movement, all while creating an entirely new case shape and accompanying design codes is a serious anniversary gambit. And, tourbillon aside, there is a real freshness and cohesion to the Harmony watches that makes them stand out in a sea of ultra-conservative dress watches.
 

=== Title: Hands On With Samsung’s New Gear S2 Smartwatch - Bloomberg ===

Right now every electronics company is trying to figure out what the special sauce is that will help it bring smartwatches to the wrists of mainstream consumers (just yesterday, 
 a new version of its Moto 360). Yet so far, no one has quite figured it out.
With the Gear S2, Samsung is giving it another go, starting with form factors that recall traditional watches and a few new interface flourishes to breathe new life into what is already starting to feel like a well-trod gadget.
The Gear S2 is actually a pair of watches, the S2 and the S2 Classic. The latter is a single 40mm watch with a glossy black finish, a knurled ceramic bezel, and a leather strap that can be swapped for any normal watch strap. The standard Gear S2 on the other hand is 42mm across, comes in silver or dark gray, and can only use special Samsung-compatible straps. Both sit nicely on the wrist, and the more modest sizes and round shapes are welcome changes from the chunky, rectangular shape of the original Gear S.
Beyond the form factor, the biggest news with the Gear S2 is the rotating bezel.
You twist the bezel to navigate through menus and apps, and it has a slight clicking action to give you some feedback. You turn left for notifications and right to get into apps and widgets. It's really simple, and there are always the two buttons and the normal touchscreen interactions for additional functionality. 
While most high-profile smartwatches (from everyone except Apple, of course) are running Android Wear software, the Gear S2 runs Samsung's own Tizen operating system. If you're deeply tied into the Samsung ecosystem across your television, phone, and appliances, this might not be so bad. The Gear S2 is still compatible with almost any phone running Android version 4.4 KitKat or later (not just Samsung phones), so don't worry if you don't have 
. 
That said, I wish this watch just ran Android Wear and dispensed with Samsung's partially walled-garden philosophy. When it comes to all things mobile, more connectivity, more compatibility, and more universal interactions never hurt.
Even though Tizen has a smaller app ecosystem than some competitors, Samsung says there will be about 1,000 apps when the watch launches, including all the usual stuff like Uber and Twitter, plus proprietary fitness tracking software S Health. There are also special watch faces for the S2, numbering 26 in all. These range from the very simple to a few that integrate with apps like ESPN to show sports scores or Bloomberg to keep stocks visible all day.
During my brief test, the menus seem intuitive and easy to navigate, and performance was quick and responsive. When images of the S2 were first shown a few weeks ago, people commented that the bubble-based menus were reminiscent of those on the Apple Watch, but short of there being circles involved, I noticed no meaningful similarities.
For all the hand-wringing that happens about smartwatch battery life, charging it overnight seems pretty much requisite these days. Samsung says the S2 can go two to three days on a single charge, but we'll have to see how it performs in the wild. With a quote like this, though, you should be covered for at least that first full day. To charge the S2, you drop it into a special wireless charging cradle and the face switches into alarm clock mode.
All the S2 models include onboard Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity, but there will also be a special edition announced at a later date with built-in 3G, too.
The Gear S2 and Gear S2 Classic will go on sale in the U.S. sometime in early October, and wireless carriers will be announcing their own sale dates individually. Samsung isn't offering any more information than that, including what the watches will cost. For now, we just have to sit and wait.

=== Title: ‘Steve Jobs’ Film Disappoints as Moviegoers Skip Oscar Hopeful - Bloomberg ===

Moviegoers this weekend shunned 
’ “Steve Jobs,” a sign that Sony Corp. executives may have been right to dump the biopic of the 
 co-founder.
The film generated $7.3 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, about a third of what BoxOffice.com analysts had estimated. Instead of dominating the box office as predicted, it limped in at No. 7.
Sony 
 the “Steve Jobs” project late last year after rejecting the cast and budget the filmmakers wanted, a dispute that was revealed in e-mails leaked following a cyber attack. The e-mails were among a damaging lot that ultimately led to the dismissal of then-
 co-chairman Amy Pascal.
Its troubled production was drawn out in public, with A-list actors including Leonardo DiCaprio passing on the role and senior Apple Inc. executives chastising filmmakers for their portrayal of Jobs. The hope for Universal Pictures, which acquired the film from Sony, is that it will win awards for Michael Fassbender’s critically acclaimed portrayal of the main character that may help boost ticket sales in the long run. 
“We are going to be talking about Jobs for many weeks to come,” Nick Carpou, president of domestic distribution for Universal, said in an interview. “The story of ‘Steve Jobs’ hasn’t been written yet.”
He said Universal wasn’t wrong to pick up the film from Sony.
“It is a tremendous movie,” Carpou said. “We are just as proud today to be associated with this film as we were from the beginning.”
Sony declined to comment. A spokesman for Pascal didn’t respond for requests for comment.
The film cost $30 million to make, not including marketing costs, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. While the movie had the highest-grossing limited release of the year when it opened in four theaters earlier this month, that success didn’t continue when it added 2,433 theaters over this weekend, according to Rentrak Corp. The movie generated almost $10 million through Sunday, a sum the studio has to split with theaters. 
The film faced a lot of competition from new movies aimed at the same adult audience, such as “Bridge of Spies” from 
, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst at Rentrak.
Analysts at Boxoffice.com estimated “Steve Jobs” would top the box office with $21 million in ticket sales this weekend, while Gitesh Pandya, an analyst at Box Office Guru, predicted $17 million.
“Steve Jobs,” which premiered Sept. 5 at the Telluride, Colorado, film festival, tells the story behind the launch of three computers: the Macintosh in 1984, NeXT in 1988 and iMac in 1998. 
The red-haired Fassbender was cast to play Jobs after DiCaprio and then Christian Bale dropped out of the movie. Some of the filmmakers and writer Aaron Sorkin initially opposed the choice of director Danny Boyle. 
“I think Danny needs to rethink how he wants to do the movie,” Pascal wrote in a Nov. 13, 2014, e-mail to producer Scott Rudin. “We are not gonna get anyone to help us out here at this cost with this cast.”
Critics praised Fassbender’s portrayal even though movie fans noted that he didn’t resemble Jobs, who was of Syrian descent. 
The movie also may have turned off an audience that has already been offered two other films about Jobs, who died in 2011. In September, a documentary “Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine” by Alex Gibney was released. In 2013, Ashton Kutcher starred in a critically panned movie “Jobs.”
“There is just general burnout about this story,” Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co, said in an interview. “Everybody feels like they know his story and don’t need to relive it again.”
The film received backlash from Apple chief executive Tim Cook as well as Jobs’s widow 
. Cook described it as “opportunistic,” while Powell took to 
 to praise Walt Mossberg’s review which said that it didn’t reflect the man he knew. Apple design chief Jony Ive called it a “heartbreaking” hijacking.
Moviegoers in Silicon Valley were drawn to the feature nonetheless, with three out of the top 10 grossing theaters nationwide being in the San Francisco Bay area, according to Universal.
Universal will concentrate on building audiences, Carpou said, and “the film will garner a lot of consideration for awards and that helps to incentivize moviegoers.”

=== Title: NASA Wants You to Design a Smartwatch for Space - Bloomberg ===

NASA has put out 
 asking the public to create a special smartwatch interface for astronauts to use on the International Space Station. It looks like those famous 
 might not be cutting it anymore.
The contest is open to anyone, and at time of publishing, five entries were already in progress, according to Freelancer.com. The scope of the project is pretty high-level, asking entrants to create wireframe images showing what apps would look like while displaying crew agendas, warnings and alerts, communication status, and various timers. The priorities are legibility on small screens, innovative representations of common data, and appropriate feedback to interactions. NASA’s guidelines also stipulate that designers should use Samsung’s Gear 2 smartwatch as a hardware reference for their creations.
There’s no stipulation that participants need to have the development skills to actually implement their designs, opening the contest up to a much bigger population of potential designers.
Anyone interested has four weeks to enter, and the winning designer will be awarded $1,500. While the prize money might not sound overwhelming, the résumé line item and pride are likely motivation enough for those even considering the challenge. The contest is an initiative of the NASA Tournament Lab, a division of the Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation, a branch that aims to bring technology and ideas from the private sector into the government agency.
As of now, independently developing something like this for the Apple Watch is impossible because of Apple’s restrictions. And NASA’s choice of the Samsung Gear 2 for the hardware reference is interesting, considering 
 to run operating procedures on the International Space Station. Switching even small parts of the station over to a new operating system doesn’t sound like a meager challenge.
Earlier this year, NASA also revealed that it’s working on 
for astronauts.

=== Title: This British Watch Is a Piece of Mt. Everest History - Bloomberg ===

Some watches are just plain cool. The Smiths W10 is one of those watches.
When it comes to the history of exploration, basically three sets of watches played a part: 
, 
, and Everest watches. For the last category, it's the Rolex Explorer that gets all the attention. And, yes, Edmund Hilary did have one with him as he made his way toward the summit for the first time in 1953, but he also had a Smiths watch with him. The truth has been lost to history, but by some accounts it was this Smiths that was on his wrist when he made the historic summit.
Smiths is a relatively unknown name in nonwatch nerd circles. The British brand made mechanical watches in England and Wales from the end of World War II through the early 1980s. The watches were mostly low-key dress and field watches with such names as the Admiral and Empire, though they made dash gauges and clocks for midcentury British cars, too. There are still watches being made under the Smiths name by a company called Timefactors, which now owns the trademark. However, they use Swiss movements inside and are not the same as the originals.
The most famous Smiths is the W10 military watch we have here. These watches were issued to British soldiers during the 1960s and 70s, and this one has the markings on the caseback to prove it. The W10 is about as basic as a military watch can get. It's 35 mm across, has a black dial with white Arabic numerals, and luminous markings at the hours and on the stick-shaped hands. The bright white seconds hand is what passes for fancy decoration here. The "Made in England" down at the bottom of the dial is a small detail that really sets this watch apart.
The inside mechanics are the Caliber 60466E, a basic, manually wound workhorse movement. An antimagnetic dust cover is between the caseback and the movement to protect it in the field. While some small, high-end watchmakers are still creating unique pieces in Britain, the Caliber 60466E is the last movement to have been serially produced there. 
This watch is just flat-out fun. There's a little bit of history, it's easy to wear with almost anything (though you have to stick to straps that can be threaded through the fixed bars), and it was meant to take a beating, so you don't have to be too precious about it. The W10 is also a relatively affordable way to get into the otherwise-expensive world of collecting 
.

=== Title: Vintage 1971 Patek Philippe Beta 21: Monday Morning Find - Bloomberg ===

Some watches are iconic because they look
 today as they did decades ago. Others are iconic because they represent a specific moment in watchmaking history. This slightly kitschy Patek Philippe Beta 21 is definitely the latter. True connoisseurs take note. 
You'd be hard-pressed to find a watch that looks more like a relic of the 1970s than Patek Philippe's first serially produced quartz watch, a brash gold stunner that wholeheartedly bought into the Studio 54 aesthetic. Technically this is the reference 3587/2, but everyone knows the watch by the name of the strange movement inside, the Beta 21.
The Beta 21 was Switzerland's answer to the quartz movements coming out of Japan, and it was developed by the Centre Electronique Horloger (Electronic Watch Center), a coalition of many brands including Patek, Rolex, and Piaget. The movement was extremely expensive to develop and produce, and not many final watches made it to the market from any brand. It's essentially an electronic micro-motor that is regulated by the quartz crystal, and you can hear it whirring from a few feet away. It's awesome in a "wow, that's terrible but makes me feel nostalgic" kind of way. (And if you like to make your presence known.) 
Patek chose to house its first implementation of the Beta 21 in an equally crazy design. The TV set-shaped case has a rounded square opening and two-tone gold dial. It's 43.5mm across, making it absolutely monstrous for the time. It's thick and heavy, made even more substantial by the perforated gold bracelet, which is integrated right into the sides of the case. There's no doubt this watch is from 1971. None. 
Even if you don't love the look, this watch is historically significant in two major ways.
First, it is the culmination of Switzerland's attempt to stave off death at the hands of inexpensive Japanese quartz watches. When Seiko and others attacked in the late 1960s, they did so with gusto, and many storied brands had to shut their doors. It wasn't clear at the time that mechanical watches would survive, and the Beta 21 was going to be Switzerland's lifeboat if they didn't. And, second, although mechanical watches continue to be the flagship products from Patek Philippe, the Beta 21 was the brand's first reach into quartz timekeeping. Today, the collection of 
 watches for women continues to be one of Patek's greatest commercial successes, in some ways providing the cash flow needed to continue strong mechanical R&D. 
It's important to note that the Beta 21 was not a commercial success at all. It's unclear exactly how many were produced by Patek in this case shape, but we're talking in the mere dozens most likely. This makes them extremely rare today, exacerbated by the fact that repairing the early quartz movements is difficult (thanks to sweeping seconds hands and complicated, rudimentary electronics). Finding one in this excellent of condition is nothing to scoff at.

=== Title: Vintage Rolex GMT-Master: A Big Gold Rolex for the Gold Watch Skeptic - Bloomberg ===

I'm not normally a big gold Rolex kind of guy. But this watch? This watch is just straight up incredible.
Hopefully at this point in the summer you've been able to spend a little time outside the confines of the office and maybe you've got a bit of a tan. That means it's prime gold watch season. You won't catch me endorsing oversized blingy gold watches that come complete with diamonds and require strength training before you can wear them, but something like this well-worn Rolex GMT-Master
is a perfect compromise between sober understatement and wristwatch bravado.
Rolex's gold sport watches are unique beasts. They have the same form factor as steel Submariners and 
, just the material and color schemes are changed. So, even though they're made in precious metal, the silhouettes and styling don't feel overwrought. Rolex still makes them today, but the best vintage examples are from the 1970s and '80s, when the bracelets were a little slimmer and the cases not so brightly polished.
This particular watch is a GMT-Master in solid 18-karat gold, including the intricate gold Jubilee-style bracelet (usually found on Datejusts). The gold has taken on a warm hue over the decades, since the case has probably never been polished. The bevels on the lugs are some of the sharpest I've seen on any GMT; since gold is softer than steel, any soft polishing would obliterate these immediately. Impressive. 
The dial on this watch is immaculate. It's faded from dark brown to a softer, more milk chocolate color, but all the thin gold markings look brand new. The markers are raised gold and filled with luminous material that perfectly matches the hands. Because of the shape of these markers, the style of dial is known by collectors as a "nipple dial" and is something only found on Rolex's gold sport watches. A gold date disc and faded mono-color bezel complete the look, making this about as un-flashy as a gold sport watch can be.
In general, when you think of a gold Rolex, what comes to mind is something dressy like a Day-Date or maybe even a Datejust. These watches are great, but this time of year I want a warm-toned sport watch sitting on my wrist. This one would do just fine.

=== Title: Motorola Challenges Apple With a New Moto 360 Smartwatch - Bloomberg ===

So far, Apple has been the only smartwatch maker to think deeply about its devices as fashion accessories. That changes today, Wednesday, Sept. 2. With the second generation collection of Moto 360 smartwatches, Motorola is doubling down on design while claiming that it has drastically improved on the technical side, too. 
The new Moto 360 isn't a single watch with a few small variations, as 
 was. This watch comes in three basic variations, each with a number of customizable details.
Two watches are intended for men, one that's 46 millimeters across and a second that's 42mm. They take 24mm and 20mm straps, respectably. Because the watches have lugs this year (the bits that jut out to hold the strap), all 360 models can use any properly sized watch straps, not just those from Motorola. There is also a special women's watch, which is still 42mm but uses slimmer 16mm straps to give the illusion of a smaller size.
The men's watches come in silver, black, and gold; the women's watch swaps black for rose gold. There are multiple bezel options (knurled, chamfered, etched), and the color doesn't have to be the same as the main body of the watch, either. Take leather and metal straps into account and you can get hundreds of possible combinations, very much in line with the 
.
The watches have  premium look that comes with a premium price tag: from $299. By comparison, the 2014 Moto 360 currently starts at $149. Since Android Wear now 
, Motorola seems to be positioning this smartwatch in direct opposition to the Apple Watch, and doubling the price now puts the Moto 360 in the same bracket as the Apple Watch Sport—and still well below the tariff for the standard Apple Watch.
The biggest performance complaint with the original Moto 360 concerned battery life. A lot of consumers were unable to get a full day's use out of the device without a midday top-up. This improved some via software updates, but Motorola says the new watches will perform much better right out of the box: The 46mm watches can get up to two days on a single charge, while the smaller, 42mm watches will get between a full day and a day and a half. While Moto's software is Android Wear with special watch faces and flourishes, everything is meant to look clean and minimal.
To buy the Moto 360, you can access 
, and certain models will be for sale through 
 and via 
. Preorders begin today through all three retailers, with watches scheduled to reach Best Buy and Verizon retail stores later this month. You can also preorder through the Moto Maker customization tool. This lets you design every component to get just the look and feel you want, instead of having to pick up an off-the-shelf design. For now, Moto Maker for the Moto 360 is available in the U.S., Mexico, the U.K., France, and Germany; availability may expand.
Also coming is a retail partnership with luxury department store Nordstrom, a big sign of confidence that smartwatches can achieve mainstream penetration. 
From 50 to 80 Nordstrom stores across the U.S. will start selling the Moto 360 later this month. This is the first smartwatch stocked by Nordstrom, demonstrating that Motorola is trying to market and sell the 360 as a lifestyle product (just as 
 with the Apple Watch). Each store will carry from 12 to 15 variations on the watch, more than any other brick-and-mortar retailer. They will be merchandised alongside traditional watches in the stores' jewelry departments. 
Outside the main collection will be a special 
. This watch has a fully integrated silicone rubber strap and a special screen mode that combines backlighting and reflective viewing to make it more readable in direct sunlight. It is meant for those who want full smartwatch functionality in a style more like that of a fitness tracker. Details remain sparse, with a release date yet to be set.
The Moto 360 can be preordered directly from Motorola beginning today, including custom models through the Moto Maker site. Prices range from $299 to $429. Delivery begins later this month, when the watches also hit stores.

=== Title: Phone Review: Moto X Style Gives Users Exactly What They Want - Bloomberg ===

The Moto X Style is the first flagship phone produced by Chicago's Motorola since Lenovo purchased the company from Google in October 2014. Its little brother, the 2015 Moto G, is Motorola's fastest-selling smartphone ever, and the company is hoping the Moto X Style can keep pace. It's a big phone with a unique design, and it's packing a 21 megapixel camera that Motorola says is best in class. Even with top-of-the-line specs, the price starts at $399, around half the price of competitors.
So should you buy one?
First things first: What is this phone actually called? After
 a few weeks ago, there was some confusion, because Motorola opted to split the Moto X into two separate lines and even gave a single phone two names. First there's the Moto X Play, a 5.5-inch, midrange phone that won't be sold in the U.S. Then there's the Moto X Style, which is the phone we have here. It's being sold in the U.S. as the "Moto X Pure Edition" because it runs a nearly stock version of Android and won't be tied to any carriers, but it's essentially the exact same phone as the Moto X Style sold in other countries around the world. 
With that out of the way, we can get into the phone itself. On paper, it goes toe-to-toe with the best phones from Samsung Electronics and LG. There's a 5.7-inch Quad HD display, a hexa-core processor, 3 GB of RAM, and a 21 megapixel camera. So far, so good. I won't bore you with 
, but the only major omission is a fingerprint sensor, which Moto left off to keep the price down and the design clean. It means having to unlock the phone with a password or passcode and could cause some friction when Android Pay is launched, but I don't think it's a deal breaker by any means. 
The design of the phone is definitely different from what the competitors are offering. Its screen stretches almost completely to the edges of its broad face, which means more real estate and less wasted space. The back is also curved across both axes, which helps keep the phone from naturally tipping back out of your hands. If you saw "Moto" and "5.7 inches" and instantly had fears of this phone being as unwieldy as the Motorola-made Google Nexus 6, I would understand. But after using the phone for the better part of a week, I haven't had any problems (even with my child-size hands). 
Another big selling point for Motorola is the 
, which lets you mix and match colors and finishes in an online tool and order the exact phone you want. Since this phone is being sold entirely unlocked without any carrier involvement, Moto can go directly to consumers like this (stock configurations of the Moto X Style will also be available from Best Buy and Amazon.com). You can select from a handful of rubber silicone, wood, and leather backs, a white or black front panel, and different metallic accent colors, along with a few small software customizations and engraving, too. In a world where most phones are predominantly a single color, and most often some combination of silver and black or white, a little variety is a nice way to get customers' attention.
The phone starts at $399 with 16 GB of storage and a rubber silicone back. This is a bit more than half the starting price of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 (from $696) and Apple iPhone 6 Plus (from $749). For an additional $25, you can upgrade to one of the wood or leather backs, and you can bump storage up to either 32 GB or 64 GB for $50 and $100, respectively. Totally maxed out, the phone would set you back $524. The premium backs are nice (especially the bamboo and saffiano leather), but my favorites are the basic-colored rubber ones, which are textured and make the phone a little easier to hold. And since the Moto X Style accepts microSD cards up to 128 GB for addition storage, the imperative to horde gigabytes evaporates. For the vast majority of customers, the $399 Moto X Style is the one to get.
At the end of the day, three things matter most on any smartphone: the camera, performance, and battery life. The Moto X Style scores well in all three categories. 
For most people, their smartphone is their primary camera. So if you're going to be capturing memories of romantic dinners, special trips, or your family, you want to know that you're not going to end up with blurry, subpar shots. A bad camera is a great reason to pass on a phone these days, even if everything else is amazing. In the past, Moto's cameras have left a lot to be desired, but for the Moto X Style, the company claims "best in class" performance, and it's not far off. In daylight, the camera (which you can open by twisting the phone twice) focuses quickly and has accurate color representation, and the shutter speed is fast enough that you don't get any blur. Both hardware and software are great here. As the light dims, though, some troubles did emerge. I occasionally found the camera hunting for focus, and blacks were full of noise. The camera is still toward the top of the pile, but I do have to give the edge to Samsung's latest crop of Galaxy phones. 
Overall performance was great. Menus were snappy, apps opened quickly, and the only time I found myself staring at the screen impatiently waiting for something to happen was when the phone was booting up. The Snapdragon 808 processor and abundant RAM deliver, though they do make the phone run warm if you've got a lot of apps open at once or are playing a game. Moto adds only a few things on top of Google's stock operating system, which both improves speed and means you should get software updates much faster. The voice assist and quick notifications features can be toggled in a dedicated app, and I find them generally helpful. One small hiccup I found was a problem getting my unit to connect to Bluetooth headphones, an annoyance amplified by the awkwardly placed headphone jack at the top center. Otherwise, everything was smooth sailing.
If your battery is dead, your phone is useless. It's that simple. I didn't have a single day using the Moto X Style when I ran out of juice before getting home for the night. Even when shooting the video review above, I got nearly six hours with the screen on the entire time. When you do run low, though, Moto has added a feature called Turbo Charging, which it claims is the fastest phone charging technology on the market right now. Bold claim aside, just 10 minutes plugged into the special adaptor, and I could get between five and 10 more hours of use. Since battery capacity is a problem, that's not going away soon, and solutions like this become more and more important.
There's no shortage of good Android phones right now. For the first time I can remember, it might be hard to choose which high-end handset to go for. But even in the crowded marketplace, the Moto X Style sets itself apart by giving users exactly what they want—a big screen, a sharp camera, and an all-day battery. Even if it's not the absolute top performer in every category, it's a well-rounded device that will serve most people very well. Add the personalization options, the much lower price, and the easy of ordering one without involving your carrier, and the Moto X Style starts to look even more attractive. 
Customers and competitors should both being paying attention.

. The race car itself is based on 1960s Formula One cars by Honda, such as the 
, which won the 1967 Italian Grand Prix.
What of the movie's two epic car chase sequences? The opener down deserted streets in East Berlin sees a vintage 
 dueling with a 
, both squat communist workhorses-turned-collector items.
The closing chase sees Ilya tear up a mountain on a 
built by Gerry Lisi (an exact replica of the Mark III moto designed by Steve McQueen in the ‘60s), while Solo drives an anachronistic-yet-awesome dune buggy-like creation dubbed the “
.” According to auto wrangler Alex King, two seven-feet-wide, four-wheel-drive, all-terrain vehicles were totally custom-built. (They're both chasing Alexander, driving a modified 
.) 
 
Although a major action sequence involves a British-built, 75-horsepower 
 that wreaks havoc in an industrial harbor (we can only imagine what it would do on a lake when not exchanging gunfire), the clear watercraft winner is an Italian-built 
. Seen for a flash as Victoria climbs aboard one in 
 to go to her family's private island (aka, Evil Island Lair), it is dark-wooded, exquisitely sculpted, and excessively polished while oozing class. In an e-mail, the film’s maritime wrangler called it the “Rolls-Royce of the speed boats.” 
 
Look familiar? That’s a 1960 
, better known as Pussy Galore’s helicopter from 
.
 
Napoleon Solo is a man bent on reinvention—a soldier-turned-master thief-turned-CIA wunderkind. After a heady car chase and shootout, he’ll whip up a white truffle risotto while wearing a double-breasted suit, no problem.
“He’s all about the vanity and projection of his appearance—so expensive, good-looking, and chic,” Oscar-nominated costume designer Joanna Johnston tells us. 
A gentleman’s gentleman, his Oxfords are 
, boots 
, and sunglasses 
. Buttery leather gloves from 
, as well as from 
, make safe-cracking a sumptuous affair. If he’s going to dress down, say to shoot up a secret lab, he’ll still keep bespoke with a black windbreaker and woolen slacks by vaunted London tailor 
Everest crafted all of his “important suits” in high Savile Row tradition, using pure wool fabric from 
 and 
, chosen for their quality and color.
“I also love the mills: 
, 
, and 
,” says Johnston. “The mills in the U.K. are very special.”
During that race track scene, Solo kills in a windowpane-patterned suit, a 1960s 
 loaned from 
, and a 
.
“It’s such an English thing,” Johnston explains. “Henry was very keen on it as well, so I made one for him at a local independent jeweler.” The design was Cavill’s own, depicting the two faces of the Greek god, Janus.
 
Standing a lanky six-feet, five inches, Hammer’s agent Kuryakin may be a beast of a Russian, but he wears the most American of designers like a boss. 
His go-to chestnut brown 
was off-the-shelf when the film was shot two years ago—“We had to have loads of them because it was an action film,” says Johnston—but you could snag a 
 today for around $2,000. He’s not afraid of a little corduroy jacket action either. 
Steve McQueen was a big influence on Kuryakin’s look—that and the ever-present 
 from his character's '60s TV version. Those were made by 
, in cotton and light merino wool—a brand Johnston prefers for its classic cut, excellent construction, and variety of colors. To complete the "separates" look, Johnston custom-made his 
from W. Bill wool, 
, and 
, then assembled it all with both light cream and dark navy/black
 (tartan-lined, windbreaker-like coats).
For the easiest Halloween costume ever, find a pair of signature 
 (or that pair of 
 Kuryakin wears in the final scene), a random 
 (major plot device alert), a gun, and a throaty Russian accent.
 
A 
, cinched tight—that’s everything you need to know about Debicki’s Victoria Vinciguerra. She’s gorgeous, sexy, and very, very deadly. It’s no surprise she wears that, plus a custom chiffon skirt, when she moves to ensnare Solo via sexy times at Rome's Grand Plaza.
Throughout, she sports 
 on her feet and a vintage gold 
 watch on her wrist, plus the occasional drip of 
 bracelets, pendants, and rings. No-nonsense luxe. 
Later, in the pivotal third act of the film, she’s seen in a vintage
 print sewed into an asymmetrical top—black-and-white, like her worldview. 
Meanwhile, her mustachioed, race car-driving husband Alexander (Luca Calvani) is the perfect Italian playboy: stylish and sexy, with all the right labels.
His shirts are 
, shoes 
, and that sweater, pure 
. At the racetrack, he wears handmade 
 sunglasses from Italy (natch), then switches up in the last act to a pair of vintage 
 that the actor himself found in Naples. Calvani also introduced Johnston to the (then-current season) 
 jacket he wears during the final chase.
When he does go bespoke, he favors rust and maroon suits (with 
wool) and shirts made from Swiss 
 fabric—or, like Illya, a classic John Smedley pullover.
 
For spunky Gaby, an East German mechanic-turned-undercover pawn, Johnston first bought a lot of vintage clothes for the “base” of the film, then built up her design vocabulary from them.
Although some are 
 fabrics, Johnston preferred to print her own patterns for the one-off dresses—such as that orange camo mini-dress Gaby wears to the island. The goal: lots of structure and strong silhouettes to match the strong personalities.
The accessories, though, are pure retro luxe. Among the multiple 
 sunglasses, a bug-eyed white pair from 
 stands out. Gaby's yellow purse at the racetrack is 
; at other times she carries a 
 handbag, with earrings to match. Johnston found more '60s pop baubles at 
 in London and 
 in Rome.
 
While the modern-day Checkpoint Charlie may feel like a Euro Disney East Berlin, and those chase sequences actually took place on the streets of 
 in England—“One of the worst places you could be” for historic verisimilitude, jokes production designer Oliver Scholl, who notes the "wrong" side of the road driving challenges—you can visit some of the other posh locations in the film.
“Architecture is a bigger time span,” says Scholl. “If you go to Rome now, it looks like it did then.”
The gilt-as-all-getout hotel in Rome? It really is the 
.
The Vinciguerra Estate? That’s the 
 in Caprarola, north of Rome. The nearby 
, with its giant outdoor staircase and wooden grounds (not to be confused with the Palazzo Faranese in Rome), serves as the site of a key lunch.
Victoria’s Evil Island Lair, aka Vinciguerra Island? Totally fake, but its composite components are real—a mix of a Napolitano boat factory with a big, long pier, 
 in the Bay of Naples, and 
 on the islet of Megaride. As for the garage and lower entrance at which Solo finds the Rock Crawler, those are caves beneath Naples, under the 
. (Visit 
 for a similar adventure.)
One last fun fact: When the final chase zooms from Vinciguerra Island to the countryside, the production in fact zipped from Naples to the 
 a rural area in Surrey, and to 
, on the west coast of Wales. Geography, woah. Movie magic!
 

=== Title: Tiffany Unveils New Vintage-Inspired CT60 Watch Collection - Bloomberg ===

The clock held by Atlas on the facade of Tiffany & Co. was first mounted in 1853, making it one of the earliest publicly displayed clocks in New York City. The new CT60 line of watches pays tribute to Tiffany's timekeeping history, placing New York right on the dial of a well-rounded group of watches. If you're not yet ready to head up to the mezzanine level of Tiffany to visit the 
 salon, a CT60 is a great alternative.
The collection is pretty diverse, including a three-hand model in both men's and women's sizes, a chronograph, and a limited edition calendar watch. Prices range from $4,250 to $19,000, depending on the level of complication, whether the watch is stainless steel or rose gold, and whether you prefer an alligator strap or a metal bracelet. Across the lineup, though, is a distinct vintage vibe, with faux-faded Arabic numerals, slim hands, and clean case shapes. Tiffany clearly got the memo that 
.
The three-hand CT60 comes in a 34mm size intended for women (with optional diamonds on the bezel, though I suggest going without) and a 40mm men's size that adds a date function at 6 o'clock. The dial colors are great across the board, with the rich blue and grey standing out from the rest. The red arrow tip on the second hand is a nice detail, and the luminous patina on the hour and minute hands means you can see the time in the dark. While I'm normally a big fan of bracelets on everyday watches like these, the faceted metal bracelet doesn't seem to match the rest of the design, so stick to the alligator this time. 
The chronograph adds another layer of complication and comes in a sportier package. At 42mm, it's on the large side for a watch that looks more like a dress chrono than a true sports watch, but the white dial and low-contrast numerals are really elegant. Priced at $6,750 in steel on the alligator strap, the CT60 chrono is meant to be a serious competitor to basic chronographs from the likes of Cartier and Montblanc.
Finally there's a limited edition CT60 that's available only in rose gold. It uses the same 40mm case as the three-hand models but adds date and month indicators. This model is inspired by a historic Tiffany watch owned by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, though it's much larger and has a pared down dial. At $19,000, it's on the expensive side for what it is, but if you're a fan of heritage-driven designs or love having "Tiffany" and "New York" on the dial, it could be a good choice for you. 
Considered together, the CT60 collection is a step in a good direction for Tiffany, which at one point was one of the most prestigious retailers and makers of watches in the U.S. For some time now its 
 have stood behind its other products, but it looks like those days are finally over.

=== Title: This Supersonic Pilot's Watch Is a Great Way to Start a Vintage Collection - Bloomberg ===

Pilot watches aren't always dull black-and-white affairs. The Glycine Airman SST was made for U.S. Air Force pilots (as well as civilian customers) during the 1960s and ’70s. Unlike this 
, this Airman SST doesn't have military engraving on the back, though it does bear the jet after which it's named. Yeah, SST is short for Supersonic Transport. How cool is that? 
Just looking at the dial, you might be a little overwhelmed at first. There are two rings of numbers, both going from one to 24. The Airman SST is both a 24-hour watch and a GMT watch. The first means that it tells time on a 24-hour scale, not a 12-hour scale. The hour hand goes around the two-tone, black-and-grey dial only once per day, and it takes some getting used to (noon looks like 6 o'clock, for example). But once you're oriented, it's easy to read. The darker half is for the nighttime hours, the light half for when the sun is up. Outside the main dial is a second ring, which can be rotated to track a second time zone, also on a 24-hour scale. 
The orange color scheme is bright and eye-catching, but it isn't just for decoration. The Airman SST needs to be easy to read in dark cockpits, and orange is one of the easiest colors for the human eye to pick out in poor lighting conditions. A lot of dive watch brands of the era—most famously 
, a favorite of Jacques Cousteau—also used orange on the dials for reading precisely at depth. You probably won't need the extra functionality, but it looks pretty cool, nonetheless.
 
 is still making watches today, although the collection is a mix of pieces inspired by these vintage models and gaudier, more over-the-top modern watches. Back in the ’60s and ’70s, though, it was these 24-hour watches that Glycine was best known for. Some were colorful like this; others were a little more rugged, with metal 24-hour bezels, similar to what you'd find on a 
. The brand made dress watches and simpler, military-style field watches, too, though they're less collectable today.
Watches like this are a great way to collect something less common than the usual 
 and 
 watches that get talked about so much. Those are great, don't get me wrong, but they're not everything. Looking to brands that aren't household names and seeking out unusual complications can result in finding watches that teach you a little about the history of watchmaking while also giving you arm candy you'll enjoy wearing.

=== Title: The Most Stylish Apple Watch Combinations for Every Type of Person - Bloomberg ===

Preorders for the Apple Watch 
 on April 10. First reactions are good, and many models are already spoken for through the summer. If you weren’t one of the many people who got up at 3 a.m. to snatch up your version of the brand’s inaugural fashionable wearable, you probably fall into one of two categories: 1) You’re not interested (e.g., vintage Rolex collectors, luddites) or 2) You’re not sure which style to buy.
The latter is completely understandable. Aesthetic customization is at the core of the Apple Watch—and a completely unfamiliar customer experience for the company. To help you out, and so you don’t have to rely on the fashion advice of Apple retail employees (matching blue T-shirts, anyone?), I’ve compiled an easy buyer’s guide.
There might be 38 options (3 collections, with 6 different case types, on 18 straps, all available in 2 sizes) and hundreds of combinations, but these 10 are the best. Or at least the most stylish. 
 Apple Watch Sport Space Gray aluminum case on black sport band. It’s understated and gets the (fitness-tracking) job done. 
 Your Under Armour best, or a 
 by Public School, both topped off with a rib-knit beanie and your fresh pair of Nike Air Max 1. Keep the emphasis on the fresh.
 
 Apple Watch stainless-steel case on Milanese loop. This is a timeless but modern look.

Anything. Congratulations on your first timepiece (since that Casio in 1985).
 
 Apple Watch stainless-steel case on brown modern buckle strap. This is as close to traditional as you’re going to get. 
A cigar for the men, a bright lip for the ladies.

=== Title: Comet May Reveal Clues to Our Origins as It Sweeps Past the Sun - Bloomberg ===

=== Title: New Raymond Weil Piper Watch Comes With a Free Airplane - Bloomberg ===

Aviation and wristwatches go hand in hand. From 
 to 
, you can find plenty of good reasons to strap flight instruments to your wrist. Family-owned watchmaker Raymond Weil has added another to the list with the 
, a chronograph inspired by the founder's own personal airplane. 
Most watch companies today are hundreds of years old and have been swallowed up by luxury conglomerates. Raymond Weil, on the other hand, turns 40 next year and sits alongside Rolex and Patek Philippe in the small group of independent brands. The current chief executive, Elie Bernheim, is also the grandson of founder Raymond Weil, having taken the reins from his father in April 2014. As an early anniversary celebration, Bernheim decided to commemorate his grandfather's other great passion: flying. Weil owned and flew a Piper, so the brand partnered with the aircraft maker to bring some details from the plane to the watch.
The Freelancer Piper starts out with a 45mm titanium case that's been brushed all over, including the engraved tachymeter bezel. The lack of polished surfaces works really well here, making the large case less flashy. While the 13.7mm thickness does make the watch wear a little high on the wrist, the lugs are arched at the proper angle and the strap is flexible, helping keep the height problems to a minimum. I expected to find this watch too big to wear in person and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it is. 
Since the watch is meant to be a useful tool for someone piloting a Piper, Raymond Weil included more functionality than you find in its other Freelancer chronos. In addition to hours, minutes, and seconds, there is a chronograph that counts up to 12 hours, a date window at 4 o'clock, and a GMT hand for tracking a second time zone.
Even with all this info, the dial's bold black-and-white color scheme makes it easy to read, while the blue and red accents make the chrono and GMT legible even at a quick glance. You don't want to spend too much time staring at your wrist while you're up in the air. 
The nods to the Piper plane itself have been kept relatively understated so it doesn't look like you're wearing some kind of strange advertisement for the brand. The most obvious are the altitude line pattern that sits in the seconds dial at 9 o'clock, but even that doesn't shout. The main hands have small stripes on the tips and a special shape, both of which nod to the Piper's propeller blades, and the red GMT hand was designed to look like the needle on the plane's internal compass.
The 
 chronograph is limited to only 1,500 pieces worldwide, with the first watches being delivered in just a few weeks. Each watch comes packaged in a special Piper-branded box with a model of the new Raymond Weil Piper plane flown by Elie Bernheim's brother. It is priced at $3,495.

=== Title: Monday Morning Find: A Very Early Panerai Powered by a Rolex Movement - Bloomberg ===

Before it was an internationally known brand sported by the likes of Sly Stallone, Panerai was a small watch shop in Florence that made some oversized watches for the Italian Navy. This is one of those watches.
Although Giovanni Panerai opened his watch shop in 1860, the Panerai we know today started around 1916, when the watchmaker started providing watches to the Royal Italian Navy. The watches were oversized, could be easily strapped over a wetsuit, and had brightly glowing numerals to make them easier to read underwater. The company made compasses and depth gauges to match. In the pre-digital days, divers couldn't do their jobs without watches like this. 
This Panerai dates to 1938, the first year the company made watches that carry almost all the iconic traits now associated with the brand. Most notably, this includes the "sandwich dial," in which a bottom dial plate has luminous radium applied to it and then a second layer with cut-outs for numerals and markers is layered on top. You'll also notice the broad sword-shaped hands, the knurled crown, and the long wire lugs that hold the strap to the watch. The 
 looks almost exactly like this watch.
The dial on this particular watch is a caramel brown color with darker spots and a ring towards the center. Collectors call this a "tropical" dial because it started out black and turned brown because of the elements. Sunlight can account for some of this, but considering the spotting and other marks, I wouldn't be surprised if this watch had taken in water at some point, probably on a diver's wrist. The ring is another thing entirely: These watches used radium to make them glow at night,  and the ring was caused by the radiation having being concentrated back onto the dial by the domed crystal. It's safe to wear, though I wouldn't suggest tucking it under your pillow at night.
During the early days, Panerai wasn't making its own movements. It commissioned movements from a Swiss watchmaker you may have heard of: Rolex. Because this watch has a rare transparent plexiglass caseback, you can see the name stamped right on the bridge. Around the edge, you'll see the word 
, which means the design is patented, much like as the  French 
 ca be seen on many Swiss watch crowns and casebacks. 
These early Panerai models can be tough to track down. Even when you can find one, it can be tough to know if you're getting the real deal because there were so many small variations among batches of watches. Buying from a reputable source is crucial. A later 
 appears in Christie's June 17th auction with an entirely different dial and caseback. 

=== Title: Want Don Draper’s Office From Mad Men? Here’s How to Get It - Bloomberg ===

Spoiler alert: In this past Sunday’s premiere of 
, Don Draper had his office back after getting booted before the final season's midbreak. Lucky him. (Sorry, Peggy.) We took the chance to reexamine the familiar workspace and talked to set decorator Claudette Didul about how a person in the contemporary world might recreate it. Didul has worked on the show since season four, when Don's now-iconic digs at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce first made their appearance. (The office is so famous on its own, it's actually the star of an exhibition at the 
 right now.)
Below, Didul shares with us her secrets of achieving Don's perfectly timeless—and functional—workspace. 
Quick guess what the most expensive thing bought for Don's office? Is it that clean-lined, peek-a-boo coffee table, the abstract paintings on the wall, or the midcentury modern sofa?
Trick question: All those were rented from L.A.'s warehouse of dreams, 
. In fact, more than half the items on the set were.
But of the things Didul bought outright, it's the blue pearlized glazed ceramic lamps (“from a lovely man in Chicago”) that were the priciest. She considers them a steal at $1,000 for the pair—in Manhattan they would have been four or five times as much.
Lighting is so essential to setting a mood you shouldn't skimp, she reasons.
“It’s amazing what you can do with a lamp,” says Didul, especially when it helps avoid the sickly florescent glow of commercial drop-ceilings.
Don’s Fase desk lamp came from Spain via eBay and makes a showpiece statement.
The more brutalist, chunky carved lamp by the doorway is vintage 
, one of the set decorator’s favorite brands (very collectible, notable floorsize models can cost upwards of $1,200).
If you want to set some great lighting on your own, you can do so affordably by picking up a simple lamp base from a place such as Ikea and topping it with a custom shade made out of vintage burlap or silk. (“The light is so amazing through the fabric,” explains Didul.) And don't discount sconces or pendant lamps—even if you can’t run wires through the wall or ceiling. Any good electrician can attach a pluggable base into what would otherwise be a permanent fixture, as long as you can find ways creatively to hide the wire, with paint or wallpaper. 
 and 
 are Didul’s go-tos for such work in in the New York area.
Fun fact: Plants can be vintage.
Don’t believe us? Click on pictures of a 
 (aka Mother-in-Law’s Tongue) and tell us it doesn’t remind you of doctor offices of your younger years. Didul said it'd be right at home in the lobby areas of Sterling Cooper's building.
There’s not an office that doesn’t benefit from the classiness of some foliage, as long as it's chosen appropriately. Cacti and succulents work in more modern offices. (Bamboo just screams ’90s.) Didul suggests bringing in some Spider Plants, potted Rubber Trees, and Fiddle Leaf Figs as other throwbacks to the 
era.
“Colors change the times,” says Didul, which on the show means burnt orange, avocados, golds, browns, and earth tones as the years approach the '70s. Highly visible Herman Miller Time Life chairs ($3,319) notably changed from off-white to caramel, too. So if you want your office to have a more classic, decade-spanning look, keep it to neutrals and greys. If you really want to cement it into the time period, harness the appropriate hues. (Who doesn’t think of neon as the ’80s?) It’s one of the easiest ways to set a vibe.
Take it an extra step with colored patterns.
To set a midcentury vibe without full-on redecoration, Didul suggests buying a roll of the colorful, geometrically patterned 
 when he was at Herman Miller. "If you can’t put it up in your office, you could frame it and hang it like a picture," not unlike a pieces of abstract art. Didul also suggests finding yards of vintage fabrics, by, say, Girard or 
 (a favorite from her childhood), to cover pillows or seat cushions. That accent pop of color may be all you need.
You’ve heard that old chestnut: Accessories make the man. The same can be said for your office. If anything, it’s the obsessive period detail that made the show such a hit (and OK, the psychodrama and character development, or whatever).
Didul gets effusive about the small stuff when it comes to recreating the 
 era: staplers and tape dispensers with sexy vintage curves in turquoise and olive green; fountain pens, pencil sharpeners, and tin pencil holders; boxes with enamel art on them (both Peggy and Stan Rizzo have some, his emblazoned with a pinup girl). If you're shopping in antique shops, sellers call vintage ashtrays “nut bowls”—they are glamorous, and you can repurpose them for just about anything, such as collecting paperclips or wrapped candies. (If you choose the later, try going full throwback with mints and butterscotch.)
In Don’s office, larger items, like that vintage IBM Selectric typewriter, would be, well, just props in the modern day. So Didul suggests keeping your workspace functional with something like a desk pad (“Even that can make everything feel older"). If you want a rotary phone, it's possible to find one at 
 that plugs into a modern jack ($100-$200). His RCA stereo actually works—and you can get one for $250. 
And even though you likely don't drink on the job (no judgment), it can be a glamorous touch to have a bar cart. Fill it with top-shelf liquor and glassware by Dorothy Thorpe. (Don prefers her silver-rimmed rocks glasses). AMC just gave Don’s Italian-made, glass-topped one—designer unknown, price withheld—to the Smithsonian's Museum of American History in a 
. 
Didul’s favorite spot for sourcing all this stuff? 
. “Just put ‘midcentury’ or 
 into the search box,” she advises. 
In this day of open-plan settings, you're lucky even to 
an office, let alone a spacious one—so don't junk it up. Much as Didul had to work from plans laid out by showrunner Matt Weiner and the episode directors, who needed furniture in specific spots to shoot, so do you likely have to work with a floor plan handed down from someone else. Incorporating larger statement items, such as Don's 7-foot desk or that sculptural brutalist sideboard, might require a tradeoff in other areas, like using smaller chairs for guests (Don's are orange dinette chairs from 
 in L.A.).
If you don’t have wiggle room from "essential" corporate-issue furniture, something as simple as that brass standing ashtray ($35, bought for Don on a whim) or a coat tree can add vintage flair. As Didul points out, “You don’t see those anymore.”
For quality antiques, Didul recommends trolling Craigslist (for serious), bookmarking 
, and keeping a lookout for auctions at corporations and universities, where you can often get incredible deals (Didul once got a Noguchi table for $10 and a Knoll setee for $35) if you can fight off the professional pickers. In L.A., the Los Angeles Modern Auctions (
) are a must for true quality. And dingy couches can be made usable with some new batting and new vintage-style upholstery (think gold orange or pretty Knoll blue; expect to pay $3,000+).
Designers to keep an eye out for: 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
. Vintage anything by 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
 is also a good bet.
Don’s chair, by the way, is an 
 in black leather and can be bought new ($2,039).
A final word of advice: Despite loving the "airiness" and "lightness" of Danish modern furniture, Didul is the first to admit even the "timeless" 
aesthetic is a fad you might grow out of.
"Don’t rush into it. Take your time,” she advises. “It’s OK to slowly build something, to live in the design before investing thousands of dollars that you may regret in a few years.” In other words, whatever’s hot now may be passé in a few years or just annoying to use day in and day out. There’s a reason all these offices and universities have been auctioning off their furniture, after all.

=== Title: All the Details on Motorola’s Revamped Moto X and Moto G Smartphones - Bloomberg ===

On Tuesday at a trio of press conferences in New York City, London, and Sao Paolo, Motorola announced major updates to its line of Android smartphones. Both the flagship Moto X and lower priced Moto G received overhauls, the first since 
 in October 2014. There are now three phones, the Moto X Style, Moto X Play, and Moto G, offering everything from a true flagship to a budget-conscious option. 
The new Moto X Style is larger than last year's Moto X and has significantly boosted specs in almost every regard. Most notably, the display is 5.7 inches instead of 5.2 inches, with QuadHD resolution. It's big and bright, with slim bezels so the phone isn't the size of a tablet. The curved back also helps keep the phone from feeling too big. It's much bigger and much bolder than last year's Moto X, while still looking very much part of the same family. Turbo charging is another big new feature, letting the phone juice up quickly.
But the biggest question? The camera. The 2014 Moto X's camera wasn't even close to competing with those in the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S5, the other high-end phones of last year. The Moto X Style upgrades from a 13-megapixel camera with a faux ring flash to the 21-megapixel shooter with a smaller flash sitting just below the lens. From what Motorola showed at its press conference, the camera looks like a major step up. But whether it produces sharp images with good color—on a regular basis and in all sorts of lighting conditions—will be the test by which the Moto X Style succeeds or fails.
There's also a second version of the Moto X, the Moto X Play. It houses the same 21-megapixel camera and dual LED flash, but with a smaller 5.5" full HD display (1080p). It's also going to cost $100-200 less than its big brother and Motorola is saying it can achieve a full two days of use from the large battery. This seems like the true successor to last year's Moto X, while the Style edition pushes Moto into a new tier of flagship phone. However, in a baffling move, Moto has not plans to make this phone available in the United States.
Motorola also updated the more budget-conscious Moto G. It has an HD display, the same 13-megapixel camera that's in Google's Nexus 6, and a fast processor, plus it's water resistant and storage can be expanded by up to 32GB via a microSD card slot. The Moto G can also now be custom ordered through the Moto Maker program, letting customers choose different color backs, faceplates, and storage options. It's not quite as powerful as either of the Moto X phones or other flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S6, nor is the display as good, but it's extremely close for a phone that costs less than one third the price. 
The Moto X was originally conceived while Motorola Mobility was owned by Google. These first phones under Lenovo don't show too big a departure by the new owner from the original strategy and rubric, because they are apparently working: according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh, sales are up 118% in the last year. There's a high-end flagship phone, a budget-conscious phone that won't slow you down, and a middle ground for people who want top specs without a massive 5.7" display.
The Moto X Style is priced from $399 and the Moto G from $180. All the new phones come unlocked for use on any carrier and ship with Android 5.1.1 Lollipop installed. The Moto G is available worldwide from today and the Moto X Style in September, while the Moto X Play will hit select markets in August.

=== Title: Monday Morning Find: An Astronaut’s 18K Gold Omega Speedmaster Chronograph - Bloomberg ===

The Omega Speedmaster beat out the Rolex Daytona and a handful of other chronographs to be NASA's official choice for midcentury astronauts. That's right. Watches. In. Space. Today many people call the Speedy the 
 because of this. (In 
 you can see Tom Hanks dramatically fiddling with his to time the events that would bring everyone back home safely.)
The watches that actually made it beyond the stratosphere were more modest steel chronos, but this solid 18K gold Speedy Pro was presented to Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean once he was back on earth. And now it's hitting the block.
Designed in 1969 to commemorate the first moon landing, only 1,014 watches of this model were ever produced—and this gold Speedmaster Professional is of an even rarer subset, one of 30 given to President Richard Nixon, Vice President Spiro Agnew, and the Apollo 12 astronauts. It's No. 26, to be exact, and belonged to astronaut Alan Bean, who became the fourth person to walk on the moon and later took another trip to space in the early '70s. The caseback engraving explicitly says that this watch marks "man's conquest of space with time, through time, on time."
Seriously, it just doesn't get any cooler than that.
The watch itself is quite similar to the steel Speedmasters that went to the moon. Inside is the caliber 861 movement, a slightly less expensive and robust version of the caliber 321 that sat inside Buzz Aldrin's watch, but it still has the same familiar dial layout and pump-style pushers. The tachymeter bezel is black, but the 18K gold gives the optical illusion of it having a deep burgundy color, amplified by the blockier hour markers. At 42mm, the watch was absolutely massive for the time, making it particularly well-suited to being strapped over a spacesuit for easy reading on the fly. 
With an estimate of $40,000 to $60,000, this 18K gold Omega Speedmaster is 
in 
 on April 21.

=== Title: Every Killer Car in Mad Max: Fury Road Explained - Bloomberg ===

It starts with a high-speed chase into the desert as Max (Tom Hardy) evades a band of white-painted War Boys hunting his Interceptor coupe with the zeal of religious fanatics.
It continues on a manic rant for the next two hours. Watching it feels as if you’ve been swept up in some tribal gypsy circus intoxicated by sand and sadism. 
Which is to say that 
 is everything you want it to be—especially the cars.
Colin Gibson is the man responsible for creating the movie’s pantheon of automotive insanity. As in previous movies, cars in this post-Apocalyptic desert wasteland are your weapons and your god. (The last one with Mel Gibson, 
came out 30 years ago.) They possess personalities as important as the leather-and-metal-clad maniacs who drive them. This film is one long car chase in a world drunk on "guzzoline." 
As the head production designer and art director, Gibson previously worked with series writer and director George Miller on decidedly lighter fare: 
. (He also led production for 
.)
That diverse background helped his perspective as he scavenged for car parts in Australia and Namibia—a process that took years after several efforts were postponed because of war-related delays. 
“No one taught me about cars,” Gibson tells me via phone. “But I knew I wanted to find things that were beautiful. No matter how horrific the circumstance that doesn’t mean you aren’t trying to create something beautiful. We just wanted to find something iconic, something worth salvaging.”
Gibson looked for rides without carbon fiber or computer chips—those aren’t of much use in desert conditions—and he wanted things with style. “Let’s be honest,” he says. “Nobody is going to schlep a Camry halfway across the desert.” So all the cars in the movie are vintage, which comes as a treat amidst the movie's automotive 'roid rage.
For the main story line, Gibson created 88 final cars, each with its own story and team of mechanics. But all told, he made 150 Frankenbeast vehicles—because when you've got one man with nothing to lose going up against a frothing militia of white-dusted War Boys, you've got to have some to burn.  
“There were cars that would only drive in reverse, and some had to snap in half,” Gibson says. Many of the wide-range shots were filmed with helicopters and drones at up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour. All the stunts were real.
“The camera department was terrified,” he says. “When you have 80 cars flying at 80-km per hour, occasionally you have some that don’t keep up. We destroyed more than half of those in the actual making of the film.” 
After all that, Gibson has no injuries to report.
“We had a lot of chapped lips,” he says, laughing. “I made the mistake of not putting in windscreens.”
Here are the main cars to look for amid the chaos.
Max still drives his black 1974 XB Ford Falcon Coupe made famous in the first films. Without giving away too much, we can say that it gets souped up at the Citadel (the movie's villainous lair, basically) with four-wheel drive and dozens of weapons. It also gets a massive new engine, new chassis, and buffing to a matte silver, thanks to the War Boys.
This massive rig is as much of a character in the film as any—so it makes sense that it's driven by the movie's real hero, bionic-armed Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). It’s a Czechoslovakian Tatra and Chevy Fleetmaster fused together into a six-wheel-drive 18-wheeler powered with twin V8 engines. It also has a long, bulky fuel tank and a fuel pod trailer hanging off the end. Welded to the hull are Volkswagen Beetle and Track cabin shells that are like mobile forts for the War Boys to hang onto during supply runs and battle missions. The rig also has racks of tools and concealed weapons along its entire body, along with such details as a wirework steering wheel affixed with a skull.
“I don’t think there’s anything Charlize couldn’t do,” Gibson says. “She didn’t always have to be responsible for driving it, particularly when it was going over 80 km per hour, but she most certainly did drive it.” 
The perfect car for Gas Town's fat bureaucrat is a stretch Mercedes limo with lattice cut windows. So that’s what he got: The thing oozes excess. The People Eater has mounted dozens of fancy car grills on his car that depict everyone he has consumed.
He travels amid "fire cars" and a supercharged V8 Volkswagen Beetle with a slick silver finish, triple exhaust pipes, a double-barreled flamethrower, and the ever-pounding drums of the Doof Wagon (below). They also come with thick bars for rolling, sturdy short bodies, and sand tires. Real men—not CGI actors—swung like crazy pirates on 20-foot-tall "metronome poles" balanced by weights underneath the cars. Even Miller didn't believe the raw footage at first, but "it’s all real," Gibson insists, "with some enhanced work on the fire parts.” 
Joe’s car is made of two 1959 Cadillac Devilles split, widened, and mounted with jacked-up fins along the side and rears. It's a car made for a despot, because well, he is one. (Actor Hugh Keays-Byrne also appeared in the first film). His beast has a custom gearbox, with two V16 engines and two-meter-high double-wide wheels. It has a whaler's harpoon and a flamethrower along the rear, too.  
Gibson says the tail of the 1959 Cadillac stood out to him as something exceptionally beautiful and worth salvaging.  “In a world where nobody had one of anything, it seemed a fait accompli that he would have a pair of 1959 coupe DeVilles,” Gibson says. “We spent two months making them operational.” 
This is possibly the most feverishly insane contraption of them all. Warner Brothers calls it a “sonic carmageddon,” an apt description. This speaker-stacked, guitar-thrashed monstrosity was meant to rally the troops in the way drummers marched with soldiers in ancient battles. It has a supercharged V8 engine with a mobile stage, a wall of speakers and sub-woofers, and air conditioning ducts meant to drive home the beat of the accompanying Taiko drummers. The Doof Warrior swings from a bungee cord mounted to the front as he shreds metal while flames are thrown from a double-necked electric guitar. Somebody will definitely recreate it at Burning Man this year.
Again, no spoilers, but these tribes drive things that would crush, puncture, and tear, and tunnel underground. The Buzzard Excavator was built from a M.A.N. 6X6 tractor and has 1,757 steel spikes all over its body. Fun fact: That’s the exact same number of quills found on the hide of an Australian anteater.
The hot young War Boy (Nicholas Hoult) drives a hot car: a Chevy five-window coupe with a super-turbocharged, nitrous-boosted, steel coil, V8 engine. The whole thing has canted wheels and swooping exhaust pipes. It even has details of things Nux picked up in his short life, such as a doll-face steering wheel.
“Because he was a young man, he was screaming out for a young man’s hot rod,” Gibson says. “The '32 Deuce coupe is the perfect little hot rod to drive to Valhalla—everything we did to that car was to fetishize it.”
The slow-brained son of the Warlord himself drives a 1940s-era Fargo workhorse of a truck with a harpoon, a belt-driven machine gun, and a supercharged V8 engine. The 66-inch, all-terrain tires and heavy axles are taken from a military supertanker. The thing has four feet of suspension and 600 cubic inches of displacement underneath. Perfect for a lumbering boychild.
The Bullet Farmer (just go with it) drives a 1970s-era Valiant Chassis welded to the body of a US Ripsaw Tank sardonically named "the Peacemaker." It has a machine gun, tank treads, and a torpedo slated over a water-cooled Merlin V8 engine. It also has mounted aviation parts, a sharp mouth of bullets, and a huge armory behind.
The rock riders skate the desert cliffs in adapted Gas Gas and Yamaha motorcycles made with supercharged weaponized caltrops. We also see specialized off-road buggies and fire cars, Mack trucks, and a car carrier. Even stunts such as jumping over cars on the bikes to toss hand grenades are real, not digitally created.
“George unfortunately has a huge imagination, but he became a doctor and he took this thing called the Hippocratic Oath, so he was very interested in not hurting anyone,” Gibson says.
Mad Max's pack of leathery older mamas—the Vuvalini ladies—use motorbikes that are old touring bikes with leather seats. 
“We stripped them down and made forks of washing lines and jack hammers,” Gibson says of the motorcycles. “There are also BMWs, Royal Einfelds in there. I had a whole team of people who scavenged things to add detail. The rules were to find something that was recognizable and then give you a double take.”
The Claw Cars, whose sole purpose has become destruction instead of construction, are repurposed from International Utes and a vicious Ford F250 tow truck, with big rakes and anchors on the back and huge, front digger claws. The Ploughboy is an EH wagon jacked onto an off-road frame and then rigged with harpoons and hydraulic ploughs.
Various other cars in the War Boys crew that dot the edges of the film were rat rods and muscle cars from between 1940 to 1989. They were chosen because of their stiff chassis and stylish curves (despite poor aerodynamics)—and made to be destroyed. 
 is nothing, if not one hell of a demolition derby by the time credits roll.
“We had dozens of professional drivers make these cars work—they made the cars sing,” Gibson says. “But of course, you do lose some along the way. It’s the nature of war.”

=== Title: $285,000 Will Buy You an Incredible Bit of Patek Philippe History - Bloomberg ===

You're not a real watch nerd if you don't know at least a few Patek Philippe references. (And for those of you who aren't, a "reference" is a watch's model number.) Here are some famous ones: the 
 that started the entire genre of the perpetual calendar chronograph, the 
 that owner and CEO Philippe Stern himself wore for decades, and the classic 
. But one that the real die-hards go crazy for is the ref. 3450 perpetual calendar, a more minimal take on the style that actually added functionality while dialing back the clutter.
First off, the ref. 3450 is a really rare watch. Fewer than 250 of them were made, all of them between 1981 and 1985. That's not a very long production run when you consider many Patek references were made for 20 or 30 years without any alterations. At 37mm across (but still very thin), the 3450 was large for the era and the surplus of white space on the dial makes it look even larger. It's a beauty and, in my not-so-humble opinion, one of Patek's purest and best designs. It's similar to the earlier 3448, but with a little leap year indicator at 3:30. Normally I'd prefer the cleaner option, but the leap year window is sort of off-beat and charming.
This watch dates to the end of the production period, around 1985, and has an extra feature that makes it even more collectable. Inside the date and moonphase display at 6 o'clock there's a second signature, "Beyer." This watch was originally sold through 
, which Patek authorized to add its own name to the watches sold there. 
The condition of this watch is also important. It's immaculate. You can look at the edges of the case and see how sharp they are without even having to run your finger along them. The gold hallmark (one of the first things to wear off) is still visible and the caseback still has the stark contrast between the brushed flat part and the polished curves. The watch is like a time capsule from 30 years ago.
While 3450s do come up for auction more often than you might think, finding one in good condition can be difficult. The soft yellow gold tended to not wear as well as some other metals (especially steel) and many of them were polished or retouched over the years. This watch also comes with the archive extract from Patek Philippe certifying the serial number, dates. and details. 
This Patek Philippe ref. 3450 perpetual calendar is available from 
 for $285,000. 

=== Title: Sony Walkman ZX2 Review: Don’t Spend $1,200 on a Portable Music Player - Bloomberg ===

Chances are you've owned a Sony Walkman. It probably played cassette tapes or CDs and had such features as Mega Bass and skip protection. This Walkman is nothing like that one.
The new 
 is a piece of premium audio equipment, a portable way to play high-resolution audio files that promise better fidelity. It's also $1,200.
The Walkman ZX2 is the follow-up to Sony's first high-end Walkman, last year's (you guessed it) ZX1. At 8.3 ounces, the black metal body is weighty in the hand and feels really sturdy, while the textured leatherette back adds much-needed grip. Its profile is longer and thicker than a smartphone, and that extra weight helps keep it from slipping. But it is a little awkward, especially if you're trying to put it in a pocket.
The 3.5mm audio jack is ringed in bright gold, which is Sony making sure you know you're holding something premium. Not everyone's going to love the ZX2's looks, but if you're into the whole industrial-luxe stereo aesthetic—and, yes, that's a thing; see 
 or anything from 
—you'll probably be into it. I dig it. 
The interface is another story entirely.
The ZX2 runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, which feels outdated on the new device. Using an existing operating system is a great idea, since Sony can be confident it's going to work and can focus its energy on the features that matter—but using one from late 2012 seems underwhelming. You can download apps from the Google Play store, meaning the ZX2 will run the streaming services you're already using to get your music. It can even be used like a tiny tablet in a pinch.
Things such as dedicated equalizer controls and tons of different ways to sort your music are baked into the new experience and add to the serious audiophile cred, but the overall experience was laggy and left me frustrated on multiple occasions.
Whether it was waiting for album art to fill the screen or simple things like scrolling, the ZX2 often felt half-a-second behind.
The 4-inch screen is only 854 x 480 pixels and has relatively low contrast; by comparison the 
 is only 1 inch larger but boasts 2560 x 1440 resolution with insane colors. I know that a beautiful display isn't mission-critical in a dedicated audio player, but on a supposedly top-tier device, no corners should be cut.
I do appreciate the addition of a MicroSD slot, letting you expand on the 128 GB hard drive, which could fill up quickly with those bigger hi-fi music files. A single album can be more than a gigabyte in the massive DSD format, and you could be looking at as few as 1,500 songs at that quality level.
When I first picked up the ZX2, I was excited about the physical buttons sunk into the right side; not having to dig into menus or turn on a screen to play/pause or skip tracks sounded appealing. In practice, I found it hard to get used to them after having used touchscreen controls for so long. Some people still might love them, but I could take or leave them.
The ZX2 sounds incredible. Period.
My testing process was pretty straightforward. I plugged in a pair of 
 ($300), kicked back, and hit play. My demo Walkman came loaded with a pretty diverse selection of tunes, from Nine Inch Nails to Serge Gainsbourg to the Smiths, and it made my studio apartment feel like a concert hall.
I could be faux-poetic and start describing the notes dancing around the huge soundstage, the bottomless pit of the music's negative space, and the shimmering of the quietest parts you'd never hear on compressed files. However, I'll leave it at that and say I was made a believer. Reclining on my Danish modern sofa, I closed my eyes and enjoyed every second. (OK, the couch is actually Ikea, but with the ZX2, the whole experience felt much classier.)
Out in the world, my excitement started to waver. On a walk to work with Upper East Side Manhattan street noise, during a quick trip on the subway, and even during an afternoon at a laid-back coffee shop with Sylvan Esso playing in the background, I found the ZX2's performance perfectly good but uninspiring. The music sounded exactly like what I could pump out of my iPhone 6. I even did a little side-by-side swap with some LCD Soundsystem tracks and couldn't tell the difference. There's just too much going on, too much ambient noise, and too many distractions to appreciate this level of fidelity outside a controlled environment. Even the most isolating headphones aren't going to get you to that full-on living room sound.
It's also important to remember that audio quality starts with the file you're playing. You can have thousands of dollars in gear, but if your files are poor quality, you can only do so much. To get the most out of the ZX2, you're probably going to need to rebuild your audio library to some extent. Those iTunes purchases, MP3s, and free streams will play just fine, but you're not going to notice nearly as big a difference as when you're playing AAC and DSD. 
I love the idea of a high-end gadget that does only one thing and does it extremely well. But, while the ZX2 does provide outstanding audio quality, the limited practical benefits, burden of carrying another heavy device, and steep price tag all conspire against it. As for the $1,200 question? I'm going to have to give the Walkman ZX2 a pass.
This isn't to say I recommend retreating to free streaming services and EarPods. If you're interesting in getting more out of your music, invest in a 
 and keep your eyes on the 
, as better-quality audio is likely to be one way different services will distinguish themselves. Soon you might be going hi-fi whether you want to or not.

=== Title: Review: Apple Music Is a Hot Mess With a Few Bright Spots - Bloomberg ===

When Apple launched the iTunes Music Store in April 2003, it essentially started the modern era of digital music. By 2010 it was the largest music retailer in the world and services such as Napster and Kazaa were relegated to do-you-remember Buzzfeed listicles. However, as subscription-based streaming music services began to gain ground against the old buy-to-own model, Apple stayed quiet. Spotify, Tidal, 
—Apple was still all about iTunes.
On June 30, that all changed with the 
, an ambitious new combination app and service. 
Expectations were high after Apple sat on the sidelines so long, waiting to see where streaming was going. Now, with a week of Apple Music in my rearview mirror, do I think that by leveraging its celebrity relationships, design prowess, and established position in the music industry, Apple has once again upended how we consume media? Not quite.
 Just like top competitors Spotify, Google Play Music, and Tidal, the core of Apple Music consists of building a library that you can stream or download to particular devices for offline listening. You add albums and songs to your streaming library, download the ones you want locally, and go about your business. Nothing new here. With the exception of 
, I haven't found any really notable advantages to the Apple Music catalog over those of competitors—all claim a roughly 30-million-strong library of tracks. 
 
Why? This is important: Apple Music is not the entire iTunes catalog. For that, you still need iTunes, rumors of whose death have been greatly exaggerated. 
 The existing iTunes Store app lets you purchase music not available via subscription (such as from the Beatles, for instance); the desktop application is how you access Apple Music from your computer. That it's still called iTunes feels vestigial and confusing. Moreover, the desktop interface is a mish-mash of the old iTunes and the new mobile app. There are plenty of defendable reasons for not wanting to get rid of iTunes altogether—continuity, name recognition—but the result feels strained, like a 40-year-old wearing Abercrombie & Fitch.
In addition, every song you 
 purchased through iTunes is automatically added to your Apple Music library. That's not all bad, but it's far from great. Even that one song you downloaded at a party mostly as a joke is there, and you either get to look at it every day or go through a confusing process to delete it from your iCloud Library. (Wait, another service? 
.) This is slow on a computer, nearly impossible on your phone. If you're someone who likes a well-ordered library, you'll find it spasm-inducing. I understand the decision here; it's going to work for a lot of people, but I'd love to see better controls over how this music populates. 
 The cost structure is right in line with what rivals are all offering: $9.99 per month for an individual user and $14.99 for up to six people on a family plan. This allows you full access to stream and download. There is no free tier for on-demand music, a la Spotify, nor is there a premium tier for high-quality music, as you'll find with Tidal. You're either in or you're out, and for the first three months, Apple has made the whole thing free, giving people a chance to try it before they switch over. Only the radio stations are free for everyone.
Beats 1, Apple Music's flagship radio station, is the most hyped part of the new service. Manned by DJs in Los Angeles, New York, and London (including England's celebrity DJ, Zane Lowe, who has decamped to L.A.), it aims to put a 24-hour-a-day communal global music experience live around the world. Guest shows include some hosted by musicians, and the overall music selection is really good. Listen for a few hours and you're likely to hear a few songs you can sing along with, plus a handful you've never heard but love. After a few days, I've found myself enjoying the station. I expect I'll continue to tune in.
Caveat: This is real radio. In case you forgot, that means advertisements (surprise!) and talking between songs. (Or, rather often, it's 
 "WORLDWIDE!" and "24 HOURS!" over them.) This can be charming and fun when you're up for it, but it's definitely not right for all situations. 
What gives Apple Music its edge exists beyond radio or pick-your-song type of streaming: human curation.
Apple execs could not have 
 more than at the World Wide Developers Conference in June. Instead of programs that compile playlists from meta-data, a la Pandora or Apple's own Genius playlists, breathing professionals would build them with knowledge and taste, as competitor Songza has been offering for some time.
Do human beings inherently make better playlists and curatorial decisions than machines? No. But these humans do. And Apple Music excels at driving you to them.
After an introductory exercise in defining your preferences via bubbles (a design motif lifted directly from Beats Music), Apple Music's "For You" and "New" tabs populate with playlists, album recommendations, and song ideas as they try to put the music you want to listen to as close to you as possible. I was actually blown away by how much more I enjoyed these playlists than those cobbled together by Google Play Music or Rdio. I put on 
 at the gym and 
 when some friends came over for dinner and not once had to reach for the skip button.
Hands down, this is the best thing about Apple Music. It might be worth the $9.99 monthly fee on its own.
Conversely, the worst part of Apple Music is how hard it is to navigate all this music.
There's so much going on—and Apple has tried to give users so many different paths to getting what they want—that the experience is frustrating and overwhelming. I want music to listen to, not a maze to solve. Too much good stuff is still too much. Making things simple has been one of Apple's greatest strengths for decades, and none of the trademark restraint is evident here. Instead it feels like a whole suite of new media apps shoehorned into iTunes.
 The interface is a serious issue across the board. People have long complained that Spotify and Tidal both have tiresome, black menus that don't offer much flexibility and are like nesting dolls to get through; Google gets dinged for favoring bold graphics over helpful information. The critics are right. But Apple's response has way overcorrected. There are seemingly endless ways to get into playlists, your library, and songs saved for offline viewing, and the default white-and-pink interface changes colors with little warning to match album covers. This is fine when something's black and white, or even red and blue—but when it's chartreuse and orange, reading the screen is a nightmare. There are also transparency effects and sliding menus that seem excessive and out of place. While some menus are clean and clear, others are headache-inducing.
That doesn't even touch the fact that all of these little flourishes are bad for your battery life.
Included in the five main tabs at the bottom of the main Apple Music interface is Connect. This is basically a Tumblr-like platform on which artists can share special content such as song previews, behind the scenes info, or even selfies with fans. In turn, fans can then comment and interact with the artists directly. There's no doubt a target audience for this, but is it close to encompassing the majority of Apple Music users? Unlikely. Placing Connect so front-and-center isn't a huge negative factor on its own; in an already cluttered interface, it's a pretty big offender.
 There are serious performance problems, too. More than once, Apple Music crashed on me while doing something basic such as scrolling through a menu. (With all other apps closed to make sure this wasn't due to something else.) While trying to film the video component to this review, the entire Radio tab refused to load without two hard reboots of my iPhone 6.
Compared directly to Google Play and Spotify, Apple Music seemed to have a hard time streaming over LTE. If I didn't have at least 4 or 5 dots and a clear view of the sky, forget about it. It felt the way using GPS did 10 years ago. It's easy enough to assume that the kinks will be worked out in time—this is version 1.0, after all—but remember when we said that about Apple Maps? How has that turned out? 
If I had to sum up Apple Music in a single phrase, it would be: "maddeningly uneven."
There's a fun radio station and unbelievable curation, but getting to the good stuff is tedious and often involves trudging through bells and whistles I don't care about. To me, the best-use case is hitting the play button on a great playlist or station, flipping my screen dark, and just enjoying what's coming through my headphones. No strange graphics, no nearly-invisible buttons, and no distractions. Tweeny mega-fans and iTunes devotees (yeah, I'm told they exist) might love all the features Apple Music provides, but the casual listener probably won't.
Apple Music is a perfect example of more not always being more. Restraint and a cleaned-up, pared-down interface would go a long way toward making me want to tap that little music note when I pick up my phone. For now, if I want one of those great playlists or a hit of Beats 1, I open the app reluctantly. Apple Music is certainly interesting enough to keep me playing with it during the three-month free trial—but for now, I’ve got my auto-renew set to “off.”

=== Title: Monday Morning Find: Jaeger-LeCoultre Mark XI Pilot's Watch - Bloomberg ===

Genuine military watches are the stuff of collectors' dreams. A Rolex Submariner created for use by the British Ministry of Defense (MoD) can command 20 or more times the price of a civilian equivalent. During World War II, a watch was still a crucial instrument for anyone flying a plane, and a variety of brands made pilot's watches. This Jaeger-LeCoultre is a rare variant and looks even better today than it did in the '40s.
There were two main Swiss companies contracted to make aviators' watches during World War II: IWC and Jaeger-LeCoultre. Essentially the MoD developed a series of specifications the watches had to meet that included legibility, accuracy, and durability requirements. They called this the Mark XI standard. IWC made the vast majority of Mark XI's (and both the name and style are still present in 
) but the watch we have here is of the the less common Jaeger-LeCoultre variety. 
The distinctive Mark XI traits are all there. The hours are marked with bright white Arabic numbers and accompanying hash marks at each minute. There is a skinny white seconds hand and broad minute and hour hands. The blunt hour hand, extra luminous triangle at 12 o'clock, and the little white arrow below the logo are all required, too.
The case shows some wear, but you'd expect that because it spent time on a solider's wrist. The luminous markers are made of the original radium and have faded to a rich orange hue. It's not enough radium to pose significant danger, but I have heard of collectors who love these watches, yet don't wear them every day for this reason.
On the back, you'll notice the 6B/346 spec number, an advanced standard that means the movement inside is chronometer-certified as accurate. If you take the back off, you'll find a second metal layer before you get to the movement that guards against magnetic fields, an accuracy killer that was ever-present when dealing with heavy military equipment. 
The NATO straps aren't the originals, but they're exactly what you want to wear this watch on. For durability reasons, military specifications required the lugs to have fixed bars that don't come out of place. This means you need a strap like a NATO that you can thread through them.

=== Title: The 10 Best White Shirts for Every Body Type - Bloomberg ===

There are literally millions of white dress shirts in the world. Maybe billions. But finding one that’s the perfect fit for you can be surprisingly difficult—you’ll find different cuts and different collars, and there’s that thing that happens when you get one that’s too short and it comes out of your pants. So when you find a great white shirt, you can hardly be blamed for wanting to buy a dozen at once. After all, the white shirt is a blank canvas for the rest of your outfit; nobody notices if you’re wearing the same brand day in and day out.
A great option is to get a custom shirt, either in person at a tailor shop or from online retailers like 
 or 
. But if you prefer to shop in a store or from a brand you trust, here are 10 versions of the white shirt from reliable, top fashion labels. I’ve highlighted which ones are suited to which body types, and for what occasions. There’s a shirt here for you, I promise. Now go and buy 12 of them.
The experts behind the shirting company, Hugh & Crye developed a sizing system called the fit finder, where men can find dress shirts based on their body type. Fits range from short/skinny to tall/broad and are offered across 16 sizes. First, 
: Answer a few basic questions, and punch in your height, weight, and body type. Second, shop away.
 Varying body types
The Ralph Lauren Black Label shirt is made of 100 percent cotton, which is thick enough not to be transparent and feels like a soft jersey. The tailored sloan oxford shirt features a trimmed silhouette, and the sheen makes it appropriate for black tie.
 Thinner types who like a snug, tailored fit
When it comes to formalwear, Tom Ford should be on your list; he has you covered from head to toe, with shoes, ties, and accessories. The designer traditionally cuts far slimmer than most, and his sizing starts at 38, so you might want to go for a size larger than you’re normally used to.
 Thinner guys with athletic builds
English brand Turnbull & Asser is one of my personal favorites. It’s been in the game for more than 130 years but only a year ago introduced a more tailored style. The slim-fit white marcella dress shirt is a great one, and it features the brand’s signature three-button cuff. The regent collar, which is an open look that’s still less severe than a cutaway collar, gives you the option of wearing a tie or ditching it for that casual vibe.
 Men with average body types who sometimes like to go tieless
This is the highest-quality white dress shirt at a moderate price point. Brooks Brothers offers four different fits (Madison, Regent, Milano, and Traditional) and a huge range of neck- and sleeve-size combinations.
 Tall gents, and men who need a more generous cut
Charvet is a high-end Parisian shirtmaker that used to design custom shirts for kings and the royals. That’s luxury. (Also, its accessories are beautiful and classic.) If you really want a special experience, and a shirt to match, you can get one made to your exact measurements from one of 6,000 fabrics in Charvet’s Paris shop.
Average body types
If I could award this the best white point-collar shirt ever, I would. This cotton-twill Ermenegildo Zegna shirt is an easy choice for work and afterward. It’s comfortable, sleek, and tapered at the waist for a flattering fit on a trimmer gentleman—but it comes in many size combinations.
 Broad-shouldered guys, but with a thin torso
Another brand at the helm of the shirting industry is Houston-based, family-owned company Hamilton, which is known for its bespoke services and exceptional craftsmanship. All Hamilton shirts have a tailored fit, meaning the chest and sleeves are cut slimmer.
 All body types, except the too thin or too tall
This Swedish brand cherishes high quality and genuine craftsmanship, and it shows. Eton’s Red Ribbon collection offers a selection of dress shirts, some of the best white options, in different collar and cuff variations and four different fits.
: All body types; varying fits and size options to try
Most of Thom Browne’s creations are extravagant and made specifically for the runway. (Let’s be honest: No one is going to the office wearing an elephant headpiece.) But I do applaud Mr. Browne for his creativity with more standard items, like blazers. He realizes it’s the small details that matter. What I love most about this basic white shirt is the pop of Thom Browne’s signature red, white, and blue.
 Average body type, but if you’re over 6 feet, stay away; someone who can wear a dress shirt with a little extra flair at work

=== Title: Six Sexy Pantsuits for Her: A User's Guide - Bloomberg ===

If I am being honest, I never considered my mom much of a style inspiration. I remember her leaving for work in flesh-toned stockings, silk bows tied at her neck, and layers of wavy 1980s frosted brunette hair. (Think Diane Keaton's character in 
.)
But looking back now, both fondly as a daughter and as a working woman myself (who also happens to think and talk about clothing professionally), I realize her style point of view was more dynamic and influential over me than that.
You see, that was her 9-to-5 getup. She was a CPA, whip-smart and 
 serious about her career. But she was also a beautiful woman, one completely aware of the power of her feminine wiles (used wisely, and when appropriate). When off the clock, she traded her shoulder pads in favor of off-the-shoulder bodysuits, hoop earrings, and hip-hugging jeans. (Think Cher's character in 
.)
It's this juxtaposition, showcasing the power of femininity, that I think of every time I see a sexy 
 successful woman in a killer pantsuit. Done right, a fits-like-a-glove pantsuit can be the most commanding of ladywear fashion statements. (See Anna Kendrick at the Grammys or Jennifer Aniston at the Critics' Choice Awards.)
So here's to you, mom: six pantsuits to try now. Flirty yet tasteful, these combos prove yet again that women can be two things at once.
Modernize the traditional look with tapered, folded-cuffs pants, like this pair by 
. Score bonus points for also going with gold, metal buttons on a nautical-inspired double-breasted blazer. 
This textured-dot-blazer-and-cropped-trousers set by 
 is the perfect, subtle way to add all-over pattern play both easily and stylishly. 
Channel your inner Claire Underwood (Robin Wright in 
 in this well-cut, no-nonsense crepe blazer by 
 and matching tapered grosgrain pants. Blouse underneath, optional. 
Look to Queen Bey's younger sister Solange Knowles for style inspiration when thinking about donning a bold power suit—like this red one by 
. 
This
 shawl-collar blazer (and narrow boot-cut trousers) is the ultimate femme-fatale-meets-boss-lady suit: low-cut and black with silk lapels. 
Busy toppers, like this black-and-white striped blazer by 
, look best styled with a solid, slimmed-down bottom like these high-waisted trousers. You could also try this versatile look with black cigarette-leg jeans or pleated cream pants. 

=== Title: Five High-Tech Standing Desks That Look Good, Too - Bloomberg ===

Sure, standing at your desk all day can be a bit of a pain, but spending the 9-to-5 leaning back or hunched over is 
. Luckily, you no longer have to choose between the workstation equivalent of a juice cleanse or a 
. There's a new crop of adjustable high-tech desks that do everything from tracking your standing and sitting patterns to playing your favorite tunes, including a desk that's handsome enough it might convince you to stand all day, anyway.
 
The 
 is all hardwood, brushed metal, and slick glass, with a clean workspace that packs in a lot of gizmos. (Insert 
 metaphor here.) You actually have a profile within the desk's software—yes, this desk 
—and it learns your standing and sitting habits over time, feeds that data to your Fitbit over the Bluetooth connection, and has Wi-Fi for receiving automatic software updates. Everything is operated by a touchscreen. It's total overkill in the best way. 
 
The 
 is less a single product and more a platform. You can mix and match different colored frames, optional trays and monitor arms, various desktop materials (or just get a frame and use your own top), before finishing it out with an integrated set of Harman Kardon speakers to create the desk fit just for you. One of the best add-ons is a $49 programmable adjuster that will move the desk to four preset-height positions. There's also a treadmill option (+$999), but save your pennies and just join a gym. 
 
If you're not ready to spend small-boat prices for the F1, the 
 gets you most of the way there, with fewer frills and an easier-to-swallow price tag. You still get a fully adjustable desk that learns your patterns over time and starts to predict your favorite height positions, along with a speaker, spots to hang your keys and bag, and even a wireless charging pad (if you're into 
). There are all kinds of hands-free software features that run through an app; they look mostly redundant, so just focus on the hardware here. And be prepared to wait: The IndieGoGo campaign says they won't be shipping for at least a month. 
 
It's a speaker. No, wait, it's a desk. The 
 packs a seven-speaker 2.1 sound system into a desktop, mounts that on lacquered legs, covers it in leather, and encourages you to plonk your laptop right on top when you need to get something done. There's a USB cord, as well as standard headphone jack and RCA for plugging into the onboard sound card, so you get every bit of quality out of those high-quality music files on your laptop. (Or you could just stream 
). Who knows, having a desk you like using might even get you to work a little harder.
 
The new standing desk from
 is more of a B.Y.O.T. (bring your own tech) situation, but it's ready for the most connected customer. The maple or walnut frame. made entirely in St. Louis, has a system of compartments for routing all your cables out of sight. Pegs hold headphones and bags off the floor, slots hold your phone and tablet upright, and a built-in writing surface lets you take notes right on the desk itself. If you're willing to forsake adjustability and go straight to all-standing, all the time, we can't think of a more stylish option. 

=== Title: Monday Morning Find: Rolex Explorer II With a Rare Cream Dial - Bloomberg ===

Usually when we talk about vintage watches, we're referring to watches from before the mid-1980s, when such technologies as quick-set date mechanisms, fade-resistant paints, and sapphire crystals came onto the scene. This watch was created right as the transition to modern materials and production was taking place, and it represents that period of flux perfectly. The cream-colored dial is, in fact, the result of a mistake by a Rolex supplier, and very few of them are still out there.
When Rolex decided to change the Explorer II from the original orange-handed reference 1655 to the 16550, they made it look a lot more like the 
, but with a steel bezel and the option of a black or white dial. Except the early white dials (this one's from late 1986 or early 1987) came out with this funny cream color, instead of bright white, and they weren't terribly successful with customers. The error was corrected and ever since, the Explorer II has come in either true black or true white. 
Some collectors love the color, and others hate it. I find the lower-contrast option rather nice, though it's a little 
 close to the color of the luminous markings to be practical. Either way, it's rare—and you know what that means: It's in high demand, and it's tough to find one in good condition. Those are just the rules of watch collecting.
This example is in nice shape, though the case has been polished before. The bevels are still visible on the lugs (an absolute must for serious collectors, and one of the first things to go when the watch touches a polishing wheel) even if they're a little thinner than they used to be. The polish on the sides of the case makes the watch look almost brand-new. This is a negative for me, but it will certainly appeal to a lot of people. The bracelet is a thick Oyster-style, with no stretching and an easy release clasp.
Something to keep in mind with watches like this one—watches for which one small detail doubles or triples the value—is that people will often fake things or substitute components to multiply their return. This watch comes with a full set of boxes and the paperwork from its original sale. This means you can know that the cream dial, in which most of the value resides, is authentic and original, not a later substitution or a refinished white dial.

=== Title: CPHG 2015 Finalists: Which of These Watches Will Be Named Best of 2015? - Bloomberg ===

Preliminary votes are in, and the field for the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève (
) has narrowed to just six watches per category.
When we first 
 in July, nearly 200 watches were competing across 12 categories ranging from sturdy sport watches to mechanical exceptions. Pretty much every nook and cranny of the watch world is represented in some way, and you get a real sense of the vast diversity of what's being designed and created in workshops across Europe and Asia. (Not just Switzerland can participate.)
While we have to wait until October for the winners to be announced, here are all 72 of the finalists. 
The crafts focus this year is clearly on intricate dials, like 
's highly involved, layered Japanese shakudo engraving or 
's traditional scrimshaw art on a tiny scale. The 
 is an outlier here, since he's usually known for his engineering-centric designs.
Blancpain — Villeret, Cadran Shakudo
Girard-Perregaux — The Chambers of Wonders - The New World
Harry Winston — Premier Precious Butterfly Automatic 36mm
Hermès — Slim d'Hermès Koma Kurabé
Piaget — Altiplano Scrimshaw
Romain Gauthier — Logical One Secret Kakau Höfke
 
Stylistically, these watches have little in common, which makes for a super interesting field—we definitely didn't need six traditional perpetual calendars up against one another. The 
 is, as the name would suggest, a crazy looking watch with incredible guts. Even though the 
 would likely get my vote, I think the 
 might take the cake here.
Blancpain — Villeret Quantième Complet
Claude Meylan — Full Calendar
Hermès — Slim d'Hermès QP
Hublot — Classic Fusion Aeromoon
Tiffany & Co — CT60 Annual Calendar
Ulysse Nardin — FreakLab 
 
This category could easily be a sleeper, but this year's finalists include a number of really innovative watches: The 
 is the first chrono of its kind (and one of the most impressive watches I've ever seen), the 
 brings a monopusher into an accessible price bracket, and the 
 adds complication to the ultrathin category. The vintage-styled 
 is a pure classic, though, and may very well beat out the big boys.
Audemars Piguet — Royal Oak Concept Laptimer Michael Schumacher
Longines — Column-Wheel Single Push-Piece Chronograph
Louis Moinet — Memoris
Montblanc — Heritage Chronométrie ExoTourbillon Minute Chronograph Vasco da Gama 
Piaget — Altiplano Chrono
TAG Heuer — Carrera Calibre 18 Chronograph
 
Sometimes the mechanics take a back seat to what holds them. These gem-studded marvels are all truly over-the-top, yet with sophisticated mechanics within the eye-catching trappings.  My taste? Not quite. But the pedigrees alone make this a stumper of a category to predict.
Audemars Piguet — Diamond Punk
Bulgari — Mvsa High Jewellery Watch
Chaumet — Joséphine Aigrette Impériale
de Grisogono — Grappoli
Fabergé — Summer in Provence Multicoloured Sapphire
Piaget — Extremely Piaget Double Sided Cuff Watch
 
The key to the ladies' category is that the glitziest watch often isn't the winner. (This isn't the jewellery category, after all.) The
 is the outlier here, though 
's ornately embroidered watch isn't far from it. To my mind, something more understated like the 
 or the 
 are the real frontrunners. 
Audemars Piguet — Millenary
DeLaneau — Rondo 42 Peony
Hermès — Arceau Petite Lune with diamonds
Hublot — Big Bang Broderie
Piaget — Limelight Gala
Ulysse Nardin — Jade
 
Complications for women don't get enough attention. There are some creative watchmakers doing great things specifically designed for women instead of being ported over from the men's collection. These are those watches. Having seen the 
 back at 
, I can say its opening-and-closing mechanical flower is nothing short of unbelievable, and the 
 highly skeletonized and diamond-studded movement is hard to argue with, too.
Bulgari — Il Giardino Notturno
Chaumet — Hortensia Creative Complication
Fabergé — Lady Compliquée Peacock
Jaquet Droz — Lady 8 Flower
Montblanc — Bohème Perpetual Calendar Jewellery
Piaget — Altiplano 1200S
 
These are the big guns, the oddballs, the hyper technical virtuosity. You might not even think some of them look like watches, and I wouldn't blame you for saying so. 
 incorporates liquid into its watches (normally anything close to water is enemy number one), and 
 has concocted a special escapement that he shows off to great effect.  
Christophe Claret — Maestoso
Dewitt — Academia Mathematical
Emmanuel Bouchet — Complication One
Hautlence — Vortex
HYT — H3
Jaquet Droz — The Charming Bird 
 
This category had the biggest starting field—nominees just had to be targeted towards men—so its impossible to not think a few more watches should have been finalists from the initial batch of 32. I'm particularly shocked that the 
 didn't make it through the first round, nor did the 
. Yet from this group of six, there are no real losers. Judging here will be tight.
Bulgari — Octo Finissimo Small Seconds
Laurent Ferrier — Galet Square
Louis Vuitton — Escale Time Zone
MB&F — HMX
Piaget — Altiplano 900P
Voutilainen — GMR
 
You don't need to look further than these six watches to know that you can get a good watch for a relatively modest sum of money—"little hand" finalists must retail for less than 8,000 CHF (about $8,500). 
's worldtimer is a personal favorite, but 
's
 is another great category-killer. You could proudly wear any of these watches every day, but I'm temped to throw my hat in the ring for independent brand 
, a husband and wife team out of Austria.
Bulgari — Diagono Magnesium
Habring2 — Felix
Hermès — Slim d'Hermès
Montblanc — Heritage Spirit Orbis Terrarum
Tudor — North Flag
Zenith — Elite 6150
 
This is essentially the duel of the chronograph versus the dive watch. There are three of each here, and they span a massive price bracket, from just a few thousand dollars to well over a hundred thousand dollars. Sure, the 
 is an incredible tourbillon chronograph, but if you're looking for something to knock around, both the 
 and 
 are bulletproof.
Audemars Piguet — Royal Oak Offshore Selfwinding Tourbillon Chronograph
Blancpain — Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe
Harry Winston — Project Z9
Seiko — Prospex Marinemaster Professional Diver's 1000m Hi-Beat 36000
Tudor — Pelagos
Zenith — El Primero Sport 
 
Six nominated, six remain—in the striking watches category the herd hasn't thinned at all. These chiming watches take years of R&D to create, so it's no surprise the category is narrow. The 
 is straight up stunning, but there's a lot of complexity hiding in the other watches that could give one of them the leg up in the end.
A. Lange & Söhne — Zeitwerk Minute Repeater
Akrivia — Tourbillon Chiming Jump Hour
Christophe Claret — Allegro
Franc Vila — Inaccessible Tourbillon Minute Repeater
Girard-Perregaux — Minute Repeater Tourbillon with Gold Bridges
Hublot — Big Bang Alarm Repeater
 
The tourbillon is one of the original complications, really 
 complication in high-end horology, and there's no shortage of watchmakers trying to breathe new life into it. You couldn't get six more diverse takes on it than these watches. We know how I feel about the
, yet I think this is down to a battle between 
 and 
, two of the modern masters in this arena.
Antoine Preziuso — Tourbillon of Tourbillons
Blancpain — L-evolution C Tourbillon Carrousel
Bovet 1822 — Braveheart
Greubel Forsey — Tourbillon 24 Secondes Vision
MB&F — Horological Machine N°6
Ulysse Nardin — Ulysse Anchor Tourbillon

=== Title: Hasselblad FV-5C Review: $15,500 Device Turns Vintage Cameras Digital - Bloomberg ===

Basic digital cameras have gotten really, really good over the past few years.
That tiny shooter sitting in your smartphone is leaps and bounds better than the highest-end digital cameras from just five years ago. But if you want to go crazy, a whole world is devoted to the pixel-based descendants of medium- and large-format photography. This is the stuff of 
 covers and Calvin Klein billboards. While it's not a complete camera on its own, 
 digital back is an attachment that turns vintage cameras and lenses into high-resolution digital cameras that compete with 
.
For the non-nerds among us, it's worth noting what medium- and large-format photography are.
In the good old days of film, most people shot 35mm. The name "35mm" is actually a misnomer, referring to the 36mm-long edge of a single frame on a negative. If you ever loaded a little canister of Kodachrome or Velvia into the back of a camera, this is what you were shooting. Medium-format was a larger 60mm square or 90mm x 60mm rectangle, while large-format films could be more than 100mm on the longest edge. It's a slight oversimplifications, but the bigger the negative, the higher the resolution; this is the same reason why IMAX shoots on larger film than standard movies. 
Hasselblad's best-known cameras from the 20th century shot in the 90mm x 60mm medium format, but since most pros are shooting digital these days, a lot of great cameras have been sitting dormant for years. The CFV-50C solves that problem. 
While Hasselblad has made digital medium-format cameras for a few years now, these new cameras have been their own systems of lenses, bodies, and backs that were unable to interface easily with older equipment. The 50C is a digital back designed with older film cameras in mind, and it can replace the analog film magazine on the back of almost any medium-format Hasselblad going back to 1957. The finishes have even been matched to Hasselblad's older models, so in most cases onlookers won't even be able to tell that this back is a later add-on to your vintage bodies and lenses.
The heart of the 50C is a massive image sensor. It's 43.8mm x 32.9mm, meaning it has approximately 60 percent more surface area than the full-frame sensors found in top DSLRs, such as Canon's 5D, and it fits 50 megapixels into that space. Images come out with a 8,272 x 6,200 pixel total resolution and have 16-bit color depth. A single file can be more than 150 megabytes at top quality.
This is all to say that you get big images with bright, accurate colors, and as you zoom in, more details will continue to reveal themselves. 
 
The raw specs put the 50C toward the top of the digital photography dog pile, so naturally, there's a price tag to match. 
The back alone will set you back $15,500, and even if you buy a modest vintage back and lens combo, you're likely running north of $20,000 just to get started. This isn't outlandish when it comes to digital medium- and large-format photography, but it makes the 
 look like a downright bargain by comparison.
While the photos that come out of the 50C are the result of modern technology, the experience of shooting with it is almost entirely dictated by the camera to which you've attached it. 
The only things you need to set on the 50C itself are ISO (it goes from 100 to 6,400) and what file format you want to shoot in (RAW, 8-bit TIFF, or both).
The menus are really simple and easy to use. It's all buttons, no touch screen, and up/down and plus/minus buttons control almost everything. When I first turned the 50C on, the menu actually seemed too simple. I expected more bells and whistles for $15,500, but I have to give it to Hasselblad for not cluttering things up for the sake of making the digital experience feel artificially expensive.
The way to physically shoot a camera like this is different, too.
First off, the camera is heavy. Almost everything in the setup is metal and glass, and there are no ergonomic grips to help—the back alone is about as heavy as a compact camera on its own, but then you're adding a large box and a hefty chunk of glass to the front, too. A neck strap would be a big help, though I went without during my trial. As with most Hasselblads, I needed to bend my back a little bit to look down into the angled viewfinder on my test unit (a use case regardless of how tall you are), and it took a little practice to get the hang of the crank-shoot motion in a way that didn't result in missing impromptu shots. By the end of an hour or two, my arms and back were in desperate need of a break.
While I enjoyed shooting this Hasselblad overall, the 50C is far from perfect. To keep the profile in line with that of a film magazine, Hasselblad opted for a bottom-mounted battery. It doesn't go in a chamber; it just clips to the bottom of the device. As a result it looks really unattractive, throws off the weight balance, and makes gripping the whole camera a little awkward (especially if you use large-capacity batteries). 
Additionally, the screen is also much lower-quality than I want in a device of this caliber.
Zooming in on images is slow, and it's almost impossible to tell whether you've nailed exposure and focus from the previews because they're too low resolution. I can understand and forgive lag, since the images are big, but the inability to show a realistic preview of images is tough to get past. Especially when you're shooting a totally manual camera with an antique metering system, you need to be able to accurately check your results in the field. For $15k, I'd expect a better screen. 
 
Hardware might be fun, but what matters are the photographs, and that's where the 50C really delivers. 
Once you pull the images off the compact flash cards, you need to import them into Hasselblad's proprietary (free) Phocus software. You can technically use Adobe Lightroom, too, but I had much better results with Phocus. It's pretty standard photo editing software, optimized to handle the proprietary file formatting (color profile, size, etc.) coming out of the 50C.
Playing around with the sliders and settings a little bit, you'll immediately notice just how much data are crammed into these photographs. Zoom in, and you can get into the intricate textures of background objects. Adjust colors, and the changes are fluid without any strange fringes and distortions. Even if you leave images as is, right out of the camera, color fidelity is great, lines are clean and sharp, and dynamic range is expansive.
Comparing photos side by side on the Web is tough. You get the full effect only of what the 50C turns out when looking at and manipulating the full-size images. What you can do, however, is get a sense of just how far you can dive into a photo before you start losing detail. This is a photograph of a public art project in New York's Brooklyn Bridge Park, with bits of Manhattan in the background. It's been sampled down to 2,200 pixels wide from the original 8,272 pixels:
If you keep the photograph at its full resolution and just pull out a 2,200-pixel-wide section, this is how far in you can dive without losing any quality. Just look at the level of detail in the building windows and the textures on metal and brick surfaces:
And here are side-by-side crops of similar images taken with the 50C and with an iPhone 6 Plus. You'll see the image on the right is already degrading at this level of zoom, while plenty of flexibility is left in the image on the left. Sure, this is like saying a Lamborghini is faster than a Ford Focus, but since photos from the iPhone are what most people are most familiar with these days, I think it's worth getting a sense of the huge difference between the devices. (And of course your mileage will vary depending on the quality of your paired lens and body as well.)
I probably don't even have to say it, but a 50C-equipped Hasselblad isn't for everyone.
If you mostly use your camera to grab snapshots of your kid's soccer games or to document your vacation, you'll want something lighter, easier, and all-around less involved. There's also no question that $15,500 is a lot of money for something that's not even an entire camera unit, but rather just the image sensor and case. 
But if you're a serious hobbyist, make a living taking photographs, or have a bunch of vintage Hasselblad gear, you should definitely take a closer look at the CFV-50C.
Even as someone who's shot a lot of the world's best cameras, both as a hobbyist and a writer, I was surprised by the images that came out of the 50C, both the sheer amount of detail they contained and the quality of that detail. If you're willing to put in the work, pay the price, and pair it with the right body and lenses, you'll be hard-pressed to create digital images better than what you can make with Hasselblad's 50C. 

=== Title: Greubel Forsey Made a Subtle Watch Whose Big News Is on the Back - Bloomberg ===

Avant-garde watchmakers Greubel Forsey don't make understated timepieces. It's just not their thing. At first glance, the Tourbillon 24-Secondes Vision appears to be a streamlined dress watch, but there's something lurking behind the clean facade. On the back of the symmetrical case is a lone tourbillon housed in a protruding sapphire bubble. It’s kind of crazy looking, with a Millennium Falcon-type asymmetry, and it's very Greubel Forsey.
The real star of the the Tourbillon 24-Secondes Vision is this feature. Protruding from traditional frosted plates is a 2.375mm sapphire bubble that houses a 24-second tourbillon. In most watches, the tourbillon would be prominently displayed on the dial, either in an asymmetrical section of the case or set deep into the dial. My first thought on seeing this new implementation was that the bubble would make the watch uncomfortable at best, completely unwearable at worst. It turns out I was wrong: The placement of the tourbillon was chosen to have the bubble sit between the bones of your wrist so you barely feel it at all.
Looking straight at the dial, you can barely tell there's a tourbillon lurking behind the bridge that spans the 9 o’clock dial cut-out. As you tilt your wrist, though, the bevels and polished edges catch the light and the tourbillon lights up. It's a cool optical trick that lets you enjoy the complication when you want, while wearing a watch that will look unassuming to most.
The dial is solid gold with a soft-grained silver finish. The indexes are not painted but engraved, and then filled with hard-fired enamel. The result is something that looks simple but is extremely hard to make—a hallmark of this brand. The slim hands are beautiful to look at, but the minutes hand is almost too skinny and can be a little hard to find at a glance. While you're probably not wearing the Tourbillon 24-Secondes Vision for practical reasons, it does help to be able to read the time.
At 43.5 millimeters across and 13.65mm thick without the bubble, the Tourbillon 24-Secondes Vision is restrained, by Greubel Forsey standards. That doesn't make it a small watch, but the proportions are very balanced. Even on a small wrist, it wears well. Greubel Forsey's creations often fall into the "I love it in my hands but wouldn't want to wear it all day" category, but this is one I'd happily strap on regularly.
The Tourbillon 24-Secondes Vision is a limited edition of 22 numbered pieces in white gold. (Additional metals will probably be introduced.) Price is available only upon request.

=== Title: Moto 360 Review: A Pared-Back Smartwatch That May Actually Tackle Apple - Bloomberg ===

Smartwatches are still primitive technology. It's not clear yet what the
 are for the tiny wrist computers and whether they'll thrive or go the way of the minidisc player, waltzing off into the annals of early-adopter history. Of course, that isn't stoping every major smartphone maker from trying to crack the code that takes the device mainstream.
The
 isn't a radically different vision of the smartwatch, and it's actually not even 
 from the first generation model launched last year. But it is a strong iteration on an already good smartwatch and one of the few smartwatches you should actually buy.
A huge mistake smartwatch manufacturers make is forgetting that a watch is first and foremost a fashion statement.
No one sets out designing a jacket thinking, "I don't care if it's ugly, as long as it's warm." (At least no one who actually sells those jackets.) The 360's biggest upfront strength is that it looks like an actual watch. The case is round and made of stainless steel, it has arched lugs for holding the strap, and the strap options are made of Horween leather or steel, so you won't want to replace them immediately (though you can put on any standard watch strap you want). From a distance, you might not know someone's wearing a smartwatch at all.
You can buy the Moto 360  in a few different color configurations from such places as Best Buy and Amazon.com or design your own through 
. This lets you pick your size, bezel, bracelet, and colors—a route you definitely want to go. Two sizes are available for men, the 46 mm we had last year and a smaller 42 mm. For women, a special 42 mm model takes slimmer straps, has different bezel options, and can also be configured in rose gold. Moto Mistake: I really wish the men's sizes came in rose gold as well.
Prices start at $300 for the 42 mm (in plain steel on a leather strap) and go up to $450 if you opt for the gold 46 mm with matching gold bracelet.
I designed myself a simple 360 to test—steel case, plain bezel, black leather strap—though you can cook up some pretty strange concoctions if that's your thing. I wouldn't recommend pairing a black case with a knurled steel bezel and a gold link bracelet, but you can do it if you want. 
It's worth noting that like the customizable 
, once you've got your watch in hand, you can't have parts swapped later (except for the strap).
So if you go for something on the bold side, make sure it's something you'll be happy with for the long haul.
The build quality on the model I tested (and the handful of samples I saw a few weeks back) is definitely premium. It might not feel quite as solid as the standard steel 
, but I really like the mix of brushed and polished finishes. As someone who spends a lot of time 
, the 360 seems designed by people who truly know the field. 
The first thing to know about using the Moto 360 is that it runs Android Wear, Google's smartwatch platform.
Compared with the Apple Watch, Android Wear encourages a lot less interaction. You're not meant to be playing around with your watch, calling cars through Uber, fiddling with games, and getting lost in the glossy screen. Sure, you can do a lot of these things, but that's not how the system is meant to work. Instead, think of Android Wear as an always-on stream of notifications and alerts. Sports scores, weather, incoming e-mail, and the like are all available in a simple list with a swipe up, but you can decide what buzzes your wrist and what you can call up only when you want.
The screen on the 42 mm model is 1.37 inches across, offering more than enough room for reading text messages, e-mail subject lines, and the little snippets of info you want to grab at a glance. 
Unlike the Apple Watch, the 360 has an ambient, always-on mode that shows a simplified watch face in black and white for checking the time without doing the obtrusive wrist-flick gesture we're all learning to resent. Overall, readability is good, but I did have some issues seeing the screen in bright sunlight, and a few times, as I moved in and out of different lighting conditions, the watch hunted for the right setting like a camera trying to find focus. 
There are some new additions to Moto's watch face catalog, including some with interactive complication widgets. These might let you see the current weather right on the face and then tap the icon to get a multiday forecast or allow you to touch your daily step tally to dive into your fitness goals. If you don't like Moto's faces, you can always download more from the Google Play store, where there are a few hundred total and most are free or cost just a few dollars. I can't imagine anyone not finding something he or she likes.
There's still a little black slice taken out of the bottom of the display, and yes, it still might annoy some (it was a huge source of debate among critics of the original), but I stopped noticing it rather quickly. It looks much worse on paper than in reality. Moto says that to get the thin bezels on the 360, it needs this little design quirk as a place to hide the mechanisms that power the display. It's not optimal, but it's far from a real problem.
As with all smartwatches, a big part of the Moto 360 is its fitness tracking.
Inside the case sits an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a heart-rate sensor, so you're covered for pretty much any kind of exercise short of swimming. Accuracy seemed good, and the 360 places helpful but unobtrusive alerts about your goals into your stream of Google Now cards so you can easily see your progress.
The proprietary Moto Body and Google Fit are both totally fine apps if you just want very basic info, but they're not the most full-featured. I'd suggest grabbing the free
 for something more robust. Still, if an incredible, elegant fitness tracking experience is your top priority, I still think the Apple Watch and its signature Health app is best.
One major complaint people had with the original 360 was the poor battery life—even after serious software updates, the 360 had a hard time getting through a full day of use. Not here in version 2.0. The new 360 is quoted as having a full day of battery life (up to a day and a half), and they mean it. After the first day or two, I didn't find myself looking at the battery indicator at all, even with the ambient display always on. You could probably squeeze even more out if you had the screen go dark.
To charge the Moto 360, you pop it into a slick black magnetic charging cradle. When the watch snaps into place, it goes into an alarm clock mode that's quite nice looking and gives you the time and battery-charge level in a variety of colors. Although Motorola says the 360's charger uses the Qi wireless charging standard, don't believe the hype. Moto Mistake No. 2: The watch isn't compatible with any third-party chargers. It's the official cradle or nothing, end of story.
The Moto 360's recipe for success is restraint. The hardware looks nice and will appeal to the nongeek crowd. The software passes you the information you need from your phone without offering too many superfluous features. Now that 
, watches like this can be worthy alternatives for those sticking with iOS, and the 360 wouldn't feel out of place at all next to one of Apple's devices. 
So while you still don't need a smartwatch, there are plenty of reasons to want one. Having easy access to a stream of notifications, being able to remotely control such basic things as music playback, and quality fitness tracking are all on the list. As is simply wanting a new toy. If you're ready to jump on the bandwagon as the new technology either finds its footing or slips into obscurity, the Moto 360 is a solid choice.

=== Title: The 11 Best Tacos in London (Or, Good Mexican Food Is Hard to Find) - Bloomberg ===

It’s difficult to discover decent Mexican food in London. Even the bad stuff takes some finding.
To save you the effort, I went on safari with Mexican colleagues in a hunt for the city’s best tacos. We ordered a plate of pork and beef in each restaurant, along with a drink. The search took two nights. It was a tiring exercise  fueled by hunger at the start and by margaritas at the end. Along the way, we were greeted by some friendly faces and some servers sucking on limes. We ended up singing along to Latin pop songs. Viva Mexico!
 Here’s my Top 10 list:
My mistake: I hadn’t realized this is a Tex-Mex joint for drinkers that happens to have food. My Mexican colleagues were shocked when the dishes arrived. “This is not Mexican food,” was the most measured response. The tacos were oddly rubbery and the fillings lacked flavor. For reasons of delicacy, I shan't describe the refried beans. And yet Café Pacifico is not all bad. It was packed with happy people and the service was friendly—really friendly. In fact, everyone there was so nice, I feel bad criticizing the place. So if you fancy a noisy, lively bar, give it a try. Just eat before you go. The bill: £52.31 ($78.82). Rating: 4.5/10. (5 Langley Street, Covent Garden, WC2H 9JA; +44-20-7379-7728 or 
.)
 
This cramped and crowded venue in Westbourne Park is popular with the locals—a very good-looking crowd. It’s quite charming in its way. I’d consider hanging out there, especially if I wanted to listen to reggae. The tequila served in the margaritas was Cabrito, which left my colleagues unimpressed, although the strawberry version with fresh fruit was delicious. The tortillas were cold and appeared home-made (though not by a Mexican). The fillings lacked flavor, apart from a whack of pepper. And yet I quite like the place. The bill: About £43.25. Rating: 5/10. (125 Westbourne Park Road W2 5QL; +44-20-7727-6771 or 
.)
This Portobello Road joint was packed on a Friday night: overcrowded and understaffed. Still, the customers looked happy enough; there is definitely a buzz. Service was uneven: One harried waitress rolled her eyes and walked away when we hesitated in ordering. Another was sweet. The tortillas were cold and appeared machine-made. The carnitas pork tacos were certainly top tier, but the ox-cheek tacos had less flavor. Santo is popular and not bad, but I wouldn’t go back in a hurry: That combination of uneven service and food makes you dizzy, even before a margarita. The bill: £47.81. Rating: 5.5/10. (299 Portobello Road, Notting Hill, W10 5TD; +44-20-8968-459 or 
)
This is a cheap and cheerful place with a real Mexican feel, from the music through the murals to the altar with a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe. It’s definitely a place to go hang out with a student crowd and get stuck into beers and margaritas. You get two tortillas with each taco—the Mexican way—and the service is friendly. The tacos are hardly gourmet and the sauces are on the table in bottles. But Mezcal is fun and well worth a visit. The bill: £31 plus tip. Score: 6/10. (127 Kingsland High Street, E8 2PB; +44-20-7254-1177.)
This is a dark and moody venue where you are more likely to go for a date and drinks than for fine food. While you might hope for a friendly welcome in a Mexican restaurant, the service here was a bit surly. The ambience is generic Latin. But the cochinita pibil were spicy and juicy, with just the right balance of fat. They were among the best we tried. The Carne DF ones were dry and less interesting. The tacos are served without salsa—and when we requested habanero, we were charged £1.50 extra. Still, the sauce was freshly made, unlike the bottled variety served elsewhere. The bill: £43.82. Score: 6.5/10. (153 Commercial Street, E1 6BJ; +44-20-7377-8418 or 
) 
I’ve seen Shepherd’s Bush on the Tube map. I’ve never been there to eat before. While the cochinita pork tacos could have used more depth of flavor, they were among the best we tried, and the tortillas were acceptable. The carne asada grilled steak tacos with avocado and salsa verde were on the dry side, but again OK. Habanera is a very acceptable local restaurant. The waiters were friendly, as was the Mexican barman. The Latin music playing had my colleagues singing along happily. The beers—Lager Pacifico or Negra Modelo—were most welcome. I’d definitely go back if I were in the area. The bill: £39.93. Rating: 6.5/10. (280 Uxbridge Road, Shepherd's Bush, W12 7JA; +44-20-8801-4887 or 
.)
 
This Soho hotspot was packed on a Friday night—so busy we couldn't pay for our drinks, as hard as we tried. The staffers were friendly and the atmosphere was lively. I’d happily go back and then pay what I owe. The tacos weren’t bad, although the tortillas were cold and the fillings needed bottled sauces for flavor. You’d go for the buzz and stay for the drinks and the food—if you weren’t too obsessive about authenticity. The bill: I estimate £44.44 pounds. Rating: 7/10. (16 Moor Street, Soho, W1D 5NH; +44-20-7758-4100 or 
.)
This is a posh restaurant in Mayfair, one of the most expensive areas of London. The entrance is like a nightclub, with a doorman and dark curtains. The lighting is dim, the artifacts expensive, and the Talavera pottery wash-basins are so beautiful that a visit to the washrooms is a must. The chef is Greek and our waiter was French, but he was very knowledgeable about the food, which was beautifully presented. The tortillas were hand-made. The pibil tacos were a little dry and underpowered, but not bad. The short rib variety was among the best we tasted. You pay for the location and ambience. The bill: £68.10. Rating: 7.5/10. (13-14 Cork Street, Mayfair, W1S 3NS; +44-20-7409-1300 or 
.)
Some purists criticize Wahaca. Ignore them. The friendly service, fun ambience, low prices, and vibrant food make it a winner. Chef-owner Thomasina Miers has done more than anyone to popularize Mexican food in the U.K., and her pork pibil is one of my favorite dishes. I always order it for the complex spicing. Having said that, my Mexican friends were disappointed by the tortillas, which were cold and fell apart when you picked them up. Still, I noticed that the British steak tacos featured good-quality meat that was correctly grilled. Even better, the prices are among the lowest in London. The bill: £31.05. Rating: 8/10. (66 Chandos Place, Covent Garden, C2N 4HG; +44-20-7240-1883 or 
.)
If you are looking for authentic and inexpensive Mexican food, this is the real deal. Lupita East attracts a young Mexican crowd with unfussy food and friendly service in a room where no money has been wasted on decoration. The tortillas are traditionally prepared (via nixtamalization) and if you require a plate of limes, they're served without fuss. There are regional dishes on the menu, too, such as Atun Mazatlan. The arrachera tacos are classic, though a bit dry; the cochinita pibil (pork) options are colorful and full of flavor. The bill: £39.99. Rating: 8.5/10. (60-62 Commercial Street, E1 6LT; +44-20-3141-6000 or 
)
This low-key restaurant—in a part of town where restaurants are thin on the ground—is where the Mexicans eat. It's almost like a club for the community. While the tortillas look machine-made, the tacos are generously filled with chunks of meat that are strong on flavor. They are so loaded, they can be difficult to pick up, but who cares? The arrachera (beef) tacos are good and come with a green tomatillo salsa; the cochinita pibil are outstanding; you can even taste the orange juice and the other individual ingredients. Service is friendly and efficient. The bill: £39.90 plus tip. Rating: 9/10. (130 Hampstead Road, Marylebone, NW1 3EL; +44-20-7387-4064 or 
)

=== Title: Leica Q Review: Bringing Authentic Leica Experience Into the 21st Century - Bloomberg ===

When you think of Leica, you probably don’t think digital. This is because Leica’s digital cameras, until now, have been either point-and-shoots lacking a real Leica feel or fake-vintage rangefinders with a sensor in place of film. That changes today. The Leica Q combines the top-of-the-line look and feel the German optics experts are known for, with truly progressive technology that makes it easier to get great images out of the Q than any Leica before. This is a 21st-century Leica exactly as it should be.
The Leica Q inhabits a middle ground between Leica’s consumer-focused compact cameras and its professionally minded M family of rangefinders. The former are mostly rebranded plastic Panasonic cameras meant for your pocket or backpack, while the latter have been the expensive gold standard for photojournalists for the better part of a century. The Q might be smaller and priced at less than five-figures, but it has no clicky zoom lens.
The foundations of the Q are a 24 megapixel full-frame sensor, the brand new Maestro II image processor, and a fixed (non-zoom) 28mm f/1.7 Summilux lens. Translation for all you non-camera nerds: The Q has top-of-the-line specs across the board. The combination of large sensor and bright lens means the Q can achieve great color fidelity and resolution, and in exchange for the trade-off of not having interchangeable lenses, the lens/sensor combo can be designed specifically for one another to optimize performance.
Practically, what this all means is that the Q is easy to use and produces gigantic image files that look great out of the camera. They can be processed ad nauseum, if that’s your thing. If you open the lens up to the full aperture and crank up the ISO light-sensitivity settings (the Q goes to a crazy 50,000, though you’ll want to keep it at 6,400 or lower), you can shoot anywhere that’s lighter than pitch black and still get photos that don’t look like a blurry sandbox. Colors are bright but not exaggerated, and people actually look like, well, people.
The body and lens housing are all metal, which is nice in theory and makes the camera feel amazing when you first pick it up, but I found the weighting to be a little strange, and after a few hours my lilliputian wrists started to get a little tired. If you end up springing for a Q, you’ll definitely want to grab one of the screw-on finger grips, too, as this fixed the problem and made the camera much more manageable.
I’ve shot various film and digital M rangefinders, and what shocked me most about the Q is just how much it can feel like shooting one of these cameras if you want it to.
The biggest downside to Leica’s M rangefinders for many is that they lack autofocus. When you want a visceral photography experience, this is great, and Ms are amazing cameras for pros and for taking long walks through unfamiliar cities, but just try getting a shot of your young kid at a party. The Q adds extremely fast and accurate autofocus, but not at the expense of the manual experience. You just release a lock, and the lens moves to M-style manual focus. The action is smooth, dense, and unlike any digital manual focus I’ve ever used before. The viewfinder will magnify, show focus-peaking, or both, so you can really nail the shot. This is the first digital camera I’ve actually enjoyed shooting with manual focus.
There’s also a macro mode, and when activated, the focusing scale on the lens itself changes to match. Both auto and manual focus work just the same in macro, and you can focus all the way down to 17cm (6.69 inches), which is really, really close. Shooting macro with a wide lens is a little strange, but it’s a nice option to have, and I could see experimenting with this being a lot of fun.
While the 28mm lens doesn’t zoom and can’t be swapped out, Leica added adjustable frame lines to the Q’s viewfinder that mimic what you’d find on an old film rangefinder. You fill the whole viewfinder to shoot with a 28mm field of view, but additional lines can be toggled to simulate 35mm and 50mm lenses, too. What you end up with are essentially just photographs cropped in from the beginning (if you’re shooting both raw and jpg, the raw file stays the full 28mm while the jpg is cropped) to give you the experience of two other lenses. The images you get out of the Q are big enough that practically, these crops aren’t problematic at all unless you’re printing billboards. This feature might be my favorite thing about the camera. 
I do have some gripes, though. The biggest is one that Leica fans have been complaining about since the company first got into digital cameras: The menus are so sparse and linear, it can be hard to find exactly what you’re looking for. The settings are all there; it just takes some digging to get to what you need, which can be frustrating out in the field. And while you can navigate these menus and examine photos using the touch screen instead of the buttons, it’s not nearly as responsive or dynamic as what you’re used to on your smartphone. It’s still better than what’s on most cameras, but the lag and jitters can make the experience feel less than perfect. I mostly stuck to the old-fashioned buttons.
At the $4,250 price, the Leica Q is expensive, no two ways about it.
The most similar camera to the Q is Fuji’s X100 T, another rangefinder-style compact with a fixed lens and manual controls, which retails for $1,299. While Fuji has mastered the electronic viewfinder, and the X100 T creates sharp, vivid images, the Leica optics and full-size sensor generate much more accurate, finely detailed photographs. Individual blades of grass are well separated and the sweat on a cold glass of beer looks like it might drip off the photo.
Plus, the Q nails all the little experiences, such as the feel of the focus ring, in a way that Fuji just can’t touch (and I say this as someone who primarily shoots with Fuji cameras). At a little less than one-third the price of the Q and much smaller and lighter, however, it's easier to toss into a bag for a weekend away. For casual shooters, the X100 T will probably get a lot more use and perform just as well.
The Leica Q is an incredible camera. That's not up for debate. It has a sharp lens, a high-fidelity image sensor, and a processor that lets it perform with almost no friction. Sturdy dials, a smooth focus ring, and a bright viewfinder simulate the experience of using a traditional film rangefinder, but lightning-fast autofocus makes sure you don’t miss shots while fiddling with settings. Sure, it’s pricey, but it’s a Leica. It it were cheap, I’d be suspicious.
If you’re looking for a camera that marries the authentic Leica experience with the modern conveniences most of us expect from a camera, and you’re willing to pay for the best, you’ll love the Q.

=== Title: Devialet Phantom Review: A $2,000 Wireless Speaker That Shakes Your Bones - Bloomberg ===

French tech startup 
 might have created the craziest wireless speaker ever. 
 pumps out music at a gut-impacting 99 decibels (about the same as what you get sitting on a motorcycle) via a streamlined sound system that packs all the components of a home audio setup into a glossy white package. The size: a little bigger than a bowling ball. Price tag: $1,990. Naturally, I had to take a closer look (and listen).
Devialet got its start in 2007 by engineering amplifiers for home audio systems that can sell for more than $30,000. Its calling card is a hybrid digital and analog amplification process that allows for high volumes without the distortion that usually comes with that territory. (Remember how your college roommate's boombox used to sound when he was blasting Nirvana? Yeah, it won't do that.)
We don’t need to get into all the gritty details of the proprietary amplification system, but suffice to say that Bernard Arnault, chief executive officer of LVMH, was impressed enough that he has invested more than $3 million in Devialet as part of its 
 funding round.
The Phantom is Devialet’s first self-contained system, meaning you don’t need a collection of speakers, an amplifier, and a pile of other gear to actually hear your music—the digital-to-analog converter (DAC), processor, amplifier, loud speakers, and connectivity are all inside. Just plug the Phantom in, connect your phone, computer, or other audio source to it via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, and you’re good to go. Think the power of a multipiece setup with the convenience of something like a Jambox. Devialet has received 88 patents on the Phantom and at almost $2,000, it’s the brand's most affordable product yet. (Affordable, of course, is relative.)
The design is driven by the need for all the sound to originate at a single point at the center of the unit—hermetically sealed by 1.2 tonnes of pressure—and to radiate out from there. This lets the speakers sit very close together without interfering with one another. What we end up with is sort of a capsule shape with a glossy white surface and chrome accents.
It’s clearly well-made and a lot of care has been taken with the aesthetics, but if R2-D2 met the original iPod in a Left Bank nightclub, the Phantom might be the next-morning surprise. In other words, it's much more Euro-tech than I'd like. In theory the Phantom is portable, too, but at 25 lbs. it's not something you’ll want to be carrying from room to room too often. Although it does come with a really nice felt case (like carrying a very stylish kettle bell) when the need strikes.
Setting up the speaker is relatively straightforward. Plug it in (yes, at 750 watts it does have to be attached to a wall), turn it on, and pair it with your device over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. If using the latter, Devialet’s proprietary Spark app (
 and 
) acts as a bridge between the Phantom and your music, either saved or streamed through a limited selection of services such as Tidal. The app also gives you more detailed volume controls (levels 1-100) and lets you network multiple units together and control them independently from one dashboard, sort of like Sonos (more on that later).
While I was able to test the app during a guided demo of the Phantom, my review unit was a prototype without Wi-Fi and thus I was unable to use Spark during my own tests. I really wish I'd had a chance to get to know the interface better as it's a critical part of the Phantom experience, and as it turns out, fairly necessary.
For instance, if you don't use Spark and stream your music directly from Spotify or Google Play Music using your phone/music player, you only get the volume controls built into your device—the only actual button on the unit is the power button. So in my tests I was limited to the dozen or so dots on my iPhone when adjusting the volume. On something this powerful, that lack of 1-to-100 fine-grained control is a problem. I often found myself struggling to keep the volume at a comfortable level in my studio apartment. Even on low settings it was too loud on some songs, and when it was too quiet, raising it one bar would sometimes make it overbearing.
Goldilocksian ideals aside, high volumes are where the Phantom really shines. This is the speaker equivalent of a sports car revving to be let loose on country back roads.
As you crank the volume up to the maximum 99 decibels, the soundstage opens up and you really start to notice the clarity and separation between instruments. Bass shakes your chest—the side woofer cones hypnotically blur along with the music (with 30 kilos of thrust force, according to Devialet's stats)—and treble is powerful without being shrill. Low-end heavy music such as SBTRKT and The Weeknd sounded boring on my headphones after using the Phantom. Listening to José González, I could almost feel the guitar strings in my hand.
I tested the Phantom both in a multi-thousand-square-foot loft in midtown Manhattan and on a large corporate terrace, and in both cases I was stunned by just how great the system sounded. The only thing missing was the party. If you want something for your living room or bedroom, the Phantom will likely be overkill (though it will still sound great).
If you ask the people at Devialet, they'll tell you that they're competing with full home theater and dozen-component audiophile setups and not Bluetooth or networked speakers. While this may be true in some ways, there's no denying that the Phantom is looking to be a super-premium alternative to the likes of Sonos.
For just a few hundred dollars you can get into either the Sonos system (starting at $199) or the Definitive Technology wireless speaker system (starting at $399), both of which will sound great in most spaces. But the bass is where the Phantom wins out. While I didn't test them head-to-head, without a $699 subwoofer offered by both Sonos and Definitive, none of the alternatives are going to come close to getting you that same bone-shaking feeling as the Phantom. Having twin woofers packed right into the all-purpose case gives it a leg up over less expensive self-contained options. But if you're looking for a totally custom multi-unit setup, you'll probably want to look elsewhere.
The Phantom is an extremely powerful audio system and definitely provides more power and clarity than anything else its size. You'd need an amplifier, a DAC, and two or three loudspeakers at the very least to get close. That said, it might just be 
 for some customers, especially those who want to use the Phantom in a small space (like my shoebox Manhattan apartment) or without a proprietary app. If you're looking to fill a huge space or like to entertain outside and want to spend your time enjoying music instead of worrying about wiring, you won't find something better than the Phantom.

=== Title: These Tech Innovations Are Works of Art. Literally. - Bloomberg ===

We're now firmly in the 21st century and art has broken out of the usual marble and canvas conventions. I mean, I love a 
 as much as the next person, but with 
 there's more out there to experience. Whether it's a subscription service to bring multimedia installations into your living room or a way to create prints from your own DNA, here's a look at some of the best ways to combine modern technology with good old-fashioned home decor.
Pulling up family photos on your flatscreen TV is one thing, but for actually displaying digital art you need something a little more purpose-built. The 
 is a 23-inch 1080p display with a matte finish and wide viewing angles. There are no cumbersome dongles or software to deal with—you control the EO1 from your smartphone and it can show off any static or moving image you can find on the Web. I mean, sure, it doesn't play sound and it's basically a high-end version of the digital picture frame you got grandma for her birthday, but if you're looking for something like this (and 
 are), the EO1 is top of the line. You'll have to be patient for now, though: The EO1 is only available for preorder and won't start shipping until September. 
Imagine if you could 3D-print a song. 
 can. The company uses a proprietary technology to record and then model sounds in three-dimensional space before using a collection of 3D printers to produce small desktop sculptures capturing them in plastic. A simple app uses your phone's camera to "read" the sculptures, playing them back on your phone. Think of it as the vinyl of the slightly quirky future. These aren't pieces of on-demand artwork (yet), and the sculptures shown here are of experimental sounds, not the latest Beyoncé single. It's early days, but it's hard not to get excited about staring your favorite song right in the face. 
Hiding behind each of these paintings is a fully functioning wireless speaker that can play behind-the-scenes interviews with the artist, tracks chosen by the artist, or whatever tunes you want to listen to while admiring your new gallery. It's about experiencing art and music together, and this time 
. If you're more of a DIYer, you can also get blank chalkboard or canvas Soundwalls and change your look with your mood (or your grocery list). 
I don't often endorse products that ask you to take a swab of the inside of your mouth before ordering, but 
 can take that gross little sample of DNA and turn it into a piece of art. Basically they take your saliva-y cheek cells, extract your DNA, and subject it to a process called electrophoresis that separates out the various components in a gel. (Yes, there will be a quiz at the bottom of this story.) The resulting pattern is then colored to your request and printed on a canvas for you to hang where you wish. All the technology is in the process, and a designy little kit they send, so just looking at the canvas on your wall, guests might not realize they're gazing at what makes you you. If DNA is too much, you can also opt for kiss print or fingerprint portraits as well, other biological markers unique to each of us. Any way you go, it's like high school biology class, but way more swank. 
Once you get past the unfortunate name, 
 is a pretty fantastic option for bringing a proper video art installation into your living room. It's a combination of dedicated hardware (either a self-contained 42-inch screen or a special drive that plugs into an existing TV/display) and a subscription service that gives you access to rotating exhibitions of multimedia art. A subscription comes with bimonthly collections, each of which comes with a printed catalog to match. Unlike the EO1, there is sound, and because everything is downloaded and then played, you don't have to worry about rough resolution should the signal cut out. No word yet on who the artists will be, but if DAD can score 
-level names like Damien Hirst without all the pretension, they might be on to something. 

=== Title: This Simple Watch Has Haunted Us Since SIHH - Bloomberg ===

It's been more than a month since SIHH ended, and 
 were shown this year. But there's one that is still on the lips of watch aficionados: IWC's Portugieser Hand-Wound Eight Days Edition "75th Anniversary." After a few years where dedicated collectors became largely disappointed with IWC's oversize, commercially oriented sport watches, IWC has created a hit. How the company did it is one of its greatest engineering accomplishments in recent memory. 
Creating an anniversary edition of a well-known watch like the Portugieser is one of those tasks that is difficult to do well, and extremely easy to totally mess up. One wrong new feature or a botched attempt at achieving a "vintage" look, and the whole thing comes across as caricature. What makes this watch so great is how balanced and even-handed the design is. Even if it wasn't a re-edition, people would take second looks.
At 43mm, the original Portugieser from 1939 was massive for the time, and the anniversary model is exactly the same size (and only a little thicker). This means that for guys who are onboard with the modern big-watch trend, it won't appear teensy, while the vintage die-hards can snottily recount this detail to anyone who notices them wearing one. There's also the vintage International Watch Co. logo, in script, at 12 o'clock instead of the modern serifed IWC. Other brands, like TAG Heuer, have found a lot of success with these throwback logos, and it's a little detail that makes the whole package feel more harmonious.
Setting aside aesthetics, the watch also sits in a technical sweet spot. The movement is an in-house caliber, meaning IWC designed it and makes it itself, something that's almost a requirement for collectors today. It's manually wound, has an eight-day power reserve, and the seconds "hack" (or stop) when you pull the crown, letting you set it precisely to the second. The finishing on the movement is nice and catches the light, but it still has that slightly industrial feel that sets IWC apart. Overall the movement is very nice, but not so ornate or technically complex as to intimidate anyone, or to drive the price of the watch too high. It's the right fit for the job.
This isn't to say the watch is perfect. It's close, and I'd love to have one strapped to my wrist as I type this, but it has its foibles. That date window tucked into the subdial at 6 o'clock is unnecessary and the only major deviation from the original 1939 Portuguese. To me it looks a little like someone took a hole punch to the dial, but it's not a deal-breaker. The name could also use some work; unwieldy names are 
, but IWC Portugieser Hand-Wound Eight Days Edition “75th Anniversary” sounds like a design brief, not something you put on a fancy box. (Then there's the business about the 75th anniversary actually having been last year, but we'll leave that well alone.) 
There are 
. The first is stainless steel with a black dial, limited to 750 pieces ($11,500), and the second a red gold version with a silver dial limited to 175 pieces ($22,000). For both, the limited editions are noted with a "One of 750" or "One of 175" engraving on the caseback, meaning there will be no squabbles over who gets the best and worst numbers. Yes, that actually happens, and while some people don't like IWC skirting the issue, it's a smart strategic play to ensure unlucky or unremarkable numbers don't sit in boutiques too long.
At SIHH, a show best known for 
, it's exciting to see a watch that people will actually buy steal the show. Here's to watches on wrists and not in safes in 2015.

=== Title: Seven Things You Need to Know About Apple Music - Bloomberg ===

Today's the day: Tuesday, June 30.
Apple Music is finally available. With it Apple enters the subscription streaming music game against power players Spotify and Rdio—something the once-kings of digital music have avoided until now. The service was 
 a few weeks
ago at the World Wide Developers Conference, but the details have been a little confusing. Don't worry. Here are the seven things you need to know to get going as soon as you update your iPhone.
Apple Music launches Tuesday, June 30. Ian Rogers, senior director of Apple Music, has tweeted that users should update their iPhones at 11 a.m. East Coast time to get Apple Music  as quickly as possible. An hour later, at noon East Coast time, Zane Lowe will kick off the Beats 1 radio broadcast from Los Angeles.
Apple Music will cost $9.99 per month or $14.99 monthly for a family plan that can accommodate up to six users. As with Spotify and Rdio, this includes offline listening and unlimited streams from the Apple Music library. There is no free tier for on-demand music. Apple is offering a free trial for the first three months, though, to lure established users to switch from competitors. (In case you've been living in a cave, artists will get royalties thanks to 
.) 
Meanwhile, Apple Radio (including the flagship Beats 1 station) is free to anyone who can sign in with an Apple ID. It will include advertisements. An Apple Music membership adds unlimited skipping ability.
ITunes is not dead. I repeat, iTunes is not dead. You'll still see that little purple iTunes Store icon on your iPhone, whether you want to or not. Customers who still prefer to buy their music one $1.29 track at a time won't have to change a thing. Everything you already own on iTunes will be seamlessly integrated into your Apple Music library, so you don't have to rebuild your collection from scratch—even that embarrassing album you bought back in 2007 that you don't want any more. (For now, you're stuck with it.)
Not everything available on iTunes is available as part of your monthly subscription. It's still available on iTunes; if you buy it separately, you can stream it, download it, and play it wherever you like. The experience will be seamless, and you won't really notice after an initial purchase that it's any different from music you don't own. Google Play already does this, but it's important to note that we won't really know what's in and what's out until the service launches. There will be over 30 million songs at launch, but whether any of those are by the Beatles or Led Zeppelin—two streaming hold-outs—remains to be seen.
Um. Good question. The details of the hyped Connect tab in Apple Music are still cloudy, but it's essentially a feed in which artists can share multimedia content, users can comment on the content, and artists can comment in response. You follow the artists you want. Any artist, big or small, can get verified and have a Connect account on which they can directly post. Ideally, this offers a way for artists and fans to interact in a casual, low-stakes way. At worst, it's a closed-off version of Tumblr that's clawed its way into your music player. Acoustic versions of yet-unreleased songs? Yes, please. A bunch of blurry selfies in dark places? Hard Pass.
Apple Music has doubled down on little features in an attempt to separate it from the very crowded pack. Of the less forgettable ones, there's a bubble-filled interface, reminiscent of the Beats Music app (under the Discover tab), which lets you select genres and artists that you like to varying degrees; Apple Music will then make playlist and album recommendations accordingly. You can also ask Siri to "play the hits from 1982" or "play more songs like this." Even if these work as well as Apple suggests, they aren't going to be what gets you to switch from Spotify over the long term.
If there are two words that Apple Music is betting everything on, it's "human curation"—the idea that its streaming service has better taste than those of competitors. You can see it in the Beats 1 radio station playlists assembled by actual people, instead of by algorithms, and in collaborations with Pitchfork and 
There's lots of handwringing about whether or not a human can make a better playlist than a program can, but that's not the point: There's culture that surrounds art compiled by human beings that doesn't come into play via algorithmic lists of songs. (It's one reason we've always loved Songza.) Apple wants you to think of Apple Music as a place to learn about music and to experience music culture, not just to listen to songs on demand. Whether that's what listeners want is another story.

=== Title: Six Grown-Up Trapper Keepers for the 21st Century - Bloomberg ===

A simple briefcase is a hard sell these days.
As our work lives get ever more infused with technology, a one-pocket bag that hold a pile of papers and a pen is no longer enough for most of us. As the young freelance and entrepreneurial class relies increasingly on shared workspaces such as WeWork, a compact, portable workstation is becoming essential. You want something with lots of smaller compartments that can keep your tablet, business cards, charging cords, and notebooks organized and compact: Enter the modern portfolio case. Think of it as the grown-up version of your middle school Trapper Keeper (without the technicolor Lamborghini Countach on the front, of course). Just like slinging on 
, there's the right hint of school-boy nostalgia while making it clear to everyone that you're all grown up.
When it's all zipped up, 
 looks like a traditional document case. Your grandfather would be proud. But open it up, and there's space inside for a small laptop or a large notepad, a tablet, a pen, and all the other cards and documents you need to tote around. It's not roomy inside but should hold enough for moving around the office or heading to a client meeting. Plus, when you've got to run, one zip and you're good to go. 
For something a little more low key, reach for San Francisco-based DSPTCH's basic 
. There are different sizes to hold everything from the 11" Macbook Air to the 15" Macbook Pro (or similarly size laptops, of course), and all of them include elastic straps and pockets to keep your chargers, cables, and other accessories right where you need them. It's purely utilitarian in the best way possible. 
The creators describe the 
 as a "mobile office," and they're not kidding at all. In a single pouch you can stash a laptop, tablet, chargers, cables, pens and pencils, a pair of glasses, your wallet, and even—dare I say it—papers. This can easily replace a briefcase and is ideal for a long-haul flight when you want something to tuck under the seat without ruining your legroom. If you want to use it like a traditional messenger bag, just clip on the detachable strap and throw it over your shoulder. 
This is WANT doing what it does best—taking a classic and stripping it down to its most basic and elegant form. The 
's snake-skin-textured leather exterior has dark blue accents and lining with a slim handle on top for toting it around. This is by no means a carry-all, but if you just need your 13" laptop, a few papers, and a business card to slide across the table, everyone in the room will be looking at this bag from the moment you walk in the room.  
Even the Kansai's too big for you? Look no further. The 
 is for the minimalist who doesn't want to carry a single thing she's not going to need. Smooth black leather gives way to a rich burgundy cloth lining with enough space for an iPad, some pens, and your other necessities. An outside pocket gives you quick access to your most important documents, while the hidden snap keeps the overall profile slim. 
Traditional straps and subtle colors are for squares, right? Hard Graft's aptly named 
 lets you hold it with a simple hand-strap bolted to the leather back, which is in turn stitched to the plush felt body. There aren't a million tiny pockets, but the Grab still gives you enough room to fit daily essentials alongside your laptop, and you can be sure that no one else in office is going to be carrying gear the same way as you. 

=== Title: The Office of the Future Will Still Have a Terrible Bathroom - Bloomberg ===

Is there any 9-to-5 indignity greater than using the bathroom at work? Out of necessity, office workers have learned survival mechanisms such as pre-flushing (to mask any embarrassing noises), avoiding the post-lunch rush, and using that closely held-secret bathroom on the 8th floor.

=== Title: Five Reasons You Need a Real Camera, Right Now (and What to Buy) - Bloomberg ===

The best camera is the one you have with you, as the old chestnut goes.
And if you're anything like me, just the thought of leaving your home (or even the room you're sitting in) without your trusted glass rectangle is enough to cause hyperventilation—and by that, I mean your phone, which doubles as most people's camera these days. Since 2013, Apple has touted that more photos are taken with the iPhone each day than any other camera. But no matter how much you love add-on semi-pro apps like VSCO Cam and Litely, your very capable smartphone camera does have its limitations. 
Cameras—actual cameras—are better, more stylish, and 
. It might feel like a relic of the past, but here are five reasons why you need to get a real camera, right now. Just in time for the holiday weekend.
Crappy photos of your dinner at Noma Japan make you look like a chump. You can travel to the other side of the planet 
 and want to tell everyone you know, but can't be bothered to take a decent shot? Really? Camera makers know that most of us are taking photos for social media first, so speed and ease of sharing are paramount. I'm not buying a camera that requires me to figure out a work flow for my 
. The 
 ($750) has built-in Wi-Fi and can connect to your phone to upload images directly to Facebook or Flickr one at a time or automatically as they're taken. A lack of #latergram and more double taps is a good one-two punch.
The dark is your smartphone camera's worst enemy. Even with the iPhone 6's camera, which is one of the best out there, that romantic candlelit restaurant looks like a dirty sandbox with all the noise and grain—and that's if you can even get it to show anything at all. Suffice it to say it's a problem of fitting enough pixels (of a large enough size) onto a sensor and then getting enough light onto that sensor with so little space. No camera even comes close to touching the 
 ($2,499) for low-light shooting. Paired with 
 ($349), it's small enough to tote around, even if it's not quite pocketable. You can get totally usable shots in an almost pitch-black room, so making sure those embarrassing late-night photos of your friend at the after-hours club look awesome on his Facebook feed is no sweat.
Following the cardinal rule of cool, now that fewer people have real cameras, carrying one that's immediately recognizable as superlative is a good way to set yourself apart. The little red Leica dot is must-have personal branding for the slightly nerdy, 21st century globe-trotting man. Shooting with the 
 ($7,250) is entirely manual and requires some serious focus skills. It's the opposite of point-and-shoot, but when you get the shot, boy, does it look good (and you look good doing it). Remember: No one has ever stared enviously at the guy pulling a scuffed-up Galaxy S4 out of his back pocket.
Smartphone cameras are meant to be all-purpose workhorses, but when it comes to zoom and macro they're terrible. You can get little clips and screw-on lenses to help here, but if you're already open to carrying additional gear, an actual camera is an easy step—and better bet. Any zooming you do on your smartphone is (with very few exceptions) digital zoom, which is basically just pre-cropping: You're tossing out resolution to give the illusion of zoom. What you want is optical zoom, which uses moving lenses to create the magnification. The 
 ($350) offers a patently absurd 30x optical zoom lens in a package that you can fit in your back pocket. Unless you're packing a 
 or 
, lay off the espresso—holding the camera steady at 30x is nearly impossible.
I'm willing to bet that your No. 1 complaint with your phone is its battery life. A great way to keep your phone from dying by lunchtime is to stop pulling it out every five minutes, waving it around while the screen continuously refreshes, blasting the flash over and over, and synching every one of your shots to the cloud. Using the camera is one of the quickest ways to wreck your battery (and storage space, too) without even realizing it. Keep the lightweight, cool-looking 
 ($1,299) on hand instead, and selectively upload what you need with the integrated Wi-Fi or wait until you can plug the memory card in at home. No more pestering co-workers for charging cables or forgetting your precious device with that bartender you're always bothering.

=== Title: Review: The Top 5 Wireless, Noise-Canceling Headphones - Bloomberg ===

A good pair of headphones has become a must-have accessory, yet only in recent months have wireless noise-canceling headphones finally hit the big leagues. Battery life is finally long enough for them to be convenient, sound quality is finally good enough for them to develop an audience, and brands have managed to craft cans that don’t look like they belong in a 1980s recording booth.
When we decided to review these five pairs, our criteria were pretty specific: We selected headphones that are all wireless, feature active noise cancellation (ANC), are on- or over-ear, and fall in the $300 to $500 price range. Included are the Bang & Olufsen H8, the Beats Studio Wireless, the Definitive Technology Symphony 1, the Samsung Level Over, and the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless. These are top-tier consumer headphones that are meant to deliver great audio in any situation and look good doing it. 
Evaluating the headphones, I didn’t run response curves or compare noise isolation on a graph, and I didn’t do these things for a simple reason: Most people have no idea what dFBS are (don’t worry, you don’t need to know) or what different frequency caps mean. Instead, I wore each pair around New York for a few days, made some phone calls, and ran through a diverse playlist to see how the headphones perform in real life. It was a thorough test, focused on the things you actually care about.
So, how did each pair do?
The 
 ($499) is a great reminder that B&O is really, in equal parts, an electronics company and a Danish design house. Overall audio quality is outstanding (even for the only on-ear pair reviewed here), though the bass is slightly elevated. The ear cups are lambskin and memory foam, the headband leather, and the frame aluminum—chances are the H8 will look even better in a few years, after it gets roughed up a bit. The noise cancellation is clean and the touch controls are pressure-sensitive, meaning you can use them with gloves on—a huge upside at this time of year. A removable battery also means that you can carry multiple 12-hour charges for those long hauls. Attention to detail is second to none, just as you'd expect from B&O, and only the Sennheisers can even come close to competing on aesthetics and build quality.
 The H8 is built more like a luxury good than a piece of electronics, and while sound quality isn’t perfectly balanced, it’s certainly well above average.
A quick trip to Google will reveal that it is basically received knowledge that Beats are mediocre headphones sold at a premium through some all-star marketing. I’m willing to bet that most of the people jumping on that bandwagon of criticism have never actually tried a pair. Yes, the bass on the 
 ($380) is going to be heavier than you want for most music other than hip-hop, pop, and electronica, and some podcasts sound a little strange through the bottom-heavy EQ. But at just over half a pound, the headphones are extremely light, and the soft ear cups are very comfortable. It’s easy to forget they’re on your head at all (though the bright colors will make sure everyone else notices) and they fold up for safe traveling, unlike the Bang & Olufsens and Samsungs.
 The bass is over the top, but sound quality and noise canceling are otherwise good, and they're extremely wearable. They’re a perfect fit for cranking the new Drake mixtape while you blast your pecs.
Known for home sound systems, Definitive is finally in the headphone game with the 
 ($399). These headphones are big (the leather case comes with a carabiner, since it won’t fit in your bag) but the sound is incredible. The active noise canceling has no hissing or pressurized feeling and the plush leather ear cups naturally block out noise, too. They’re solid and comfortable, and the sound stage is extremely open and makes you feel as if you’re sitting in the center of a concert hall. If you close your eyes, you’ll swear the music is coming from a speaker system, not a pair of headphones. (No surprise, coming from Definitive.)
 Anyone who tells you that wireless sound quality isn’t very good should put these on their head. Definitive’s first effort is a great one. I just wish I didn’t have to clip the case to the outside of my bag,
The 
 ($349) is a confusing pair of headphones. They're really comfortable and the sound is awesome (only slightly less open than the Sennheisers or Definitives) when the active noise cancelation is on, but they're too big to be considered portable, and when the ANC is off there a strange echo effect is created by the large plastic enclosures. When the touch controls work, they are convenient and robust, but they’re also finicky: If you’re using an iOS device, the volume control is independent from that of your phone—an issue that's far more annoying than you might think. Aesthetically, the white and tan ended up looking a bit cheap; the black is slightly better. In a lot of ways, the Level Over is close to being amazing, but it still has a little way to go.
 It’s a shame that so much great technology is packed into a clumsy package. If wearing them didn’t feel like putting on a astronaut’s helmet and the kinks were worked out, I’d be sold.
This is the top-of-the-line model in the new 
 ($500) collection from Sennheiser. (On-ear and non-ANC models are available, too.) The ear cups are soft and even though they're relatively small for over-ear headphones, the soundstage produced is massive. Unlike the Beats and the Bang & Olufsens, there is no artificially elevated bass or change to the sound profile. You get whatever's on the recording, which is especially helpful for quiet music and podcasts. The noise canceling is soft and only occasionally produced the annoying buzzes and clicks that overeager ANC can create. The frame is thin and lightweight without feeling flimsy; when folded, they can easily be tossed into a 
 with no fear. 
They're the priciest headphones here, but you're getting what you pay for. Sound quality is excellent, noise cancelation is clean, and they're both comfortable and portable. It's hard to complain. (And I 
 to complain.) 
Being that guy, I'll hedge here. There are three winners: one overall winner and one each for sound quality and design.
 
These are the near-perfect storm. They produce clear sound with a surprisingly open soundstage for their size, sounding more like speakers than headphones. They're also handsome, have good battery life, and fold up for travel. Anyone familiar with Sennheiser probably isn't surprised here, but they nailed it.
This was really no contest. They're not the overall winner, due to lack of portability, but the Symphony 1 produced absolutely incredible sound (that only gets better if you're willing to plug them in instead of going wireless). For a pair of at-home headphones, you'd have to spend 5x or more to do better.
The bass might be a little boosted, but the sleek touch interface, interchangeable battery, and beautiful package makes these headphones truly lust-worthy. While the pure sound quality might be a little better on other pairs, staring at a pile of great cans, it's still the H8 that I want to put on my head

=== Title: Ten Backpacks for Grownups: A Buyer's Guide - Bloomberg ===

Summer is gear season. 
If you're going to the beach, you need sunscreen and your towel. If you're headed outside to do some work, you need your laptop and a blanket. Or your camera, gym shoes, bottle of water, very small dog—whatever. 
Regardless, you need a versatile carryall to conquer these logistical challenges. My suggestion: Consider the backpack. 
One can be compact and minimal, or cavernous and covered in pockets. Some, like the leather beauties from Tom Ford and Balenciaga, can cost as much as your lady's favorite bag. Others, such as Chrome’s functional roll-top, are inexpensive alternatives to the passé messenger bag. The main idea, though, is that—lucky for us—they’re not just for schoolboys and gym rats anymore. So here are 10 new choices for the summer. One is sure to fit your style, whatever your type.
 
The multi-use pockets and olive green material give this sack a vintage military look. It’s structured enough to keep things separate inside, but big enough to swallow gym clothes and books—or a field jacket and hiking shoes. Style tip: Wear it with a white T-Shirt and rugged blue jeans for summer. 
A.P.C. uses the traditional backpack shape here in indigo denim, with leather accents and a simple, rounded zipper top. It’s medium in size, bookish in style. Style tip: Wear it with slim khaki pants and a baseball hat. 
This black calfskin backpack looks minimal and clean, but it has interesting details like the slanted top cover along the sides, the magnetic snap closure, and the slim silver buckles on the straps. Style tip: Wear it with all white.
This is the bag for the urban warrior, messenger-boy wannabe, or the casual camper. It’s compact with a roll-top close, extra hanging handles and versatile vertical straps. Style tip: Wear it when climbing. 
Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s chic—the kind of thing you could pass to your godson when you tire of it. The top is discretely rounded in a way that perfectly offsets the large gold zipper and golden D ring buckles below. Style tip: Wear it with something sleeveless. 
It looks small, but this cognac leather and woven bag is big enough to fit a laptop computer, extra magazines, and power chords to boot. The adjustable straps are covered in leather and soft Japanese webbing. Style tip: Wear it with something navy. 
Here’s an option if you want something blue and true. The Bally Montey backpack is made in Italy from fine-grain Spanish leather. It’s discrete and modern but with cotton lining and plenty of room inside for personal effects. Style tip: Wear it with a soft, red pullover. 
Wear this when you want something that looks vintage, feels luxurious, and works as practically as canvas does. It’s traditional in its modest form but unique in its supple leather body and Japanese heritage. Style tip: Wear it with a crisp button-down shirt. 
The interior of this dual-strap rucksack is huge—and lined in twill. The front has smaller pockets for storing phones and wallets; the exterior straps will hold rain gear. Style tip: Wear it with designer sweatpants and Nike trainers. 
Consider this the complex option for the complex guy: Four small exterior pockets line the front, topped by a dual buckle closure. The cognac suede exterior is trimmed in tonal leather. Style tip: Wear it with something slim and black. 

=== Title: The 12 Good Snacks (and One Awful One) You’ll Be Eating This Year - Bloomberg ===

Imagine the contents of the world's largest vending machine upended into a windowless midtown Manhattan conference room and you have 
, the media's big night to sample the best and brightest new foods that you'll be boredom-eating in 2015.
A couple of dozen exhibition tables line two sides of the meeting room, staffed by bright-eyed, golf-shirted publicists armed with product samples, coupons, and handouts. Journalists like me amble around shouldering giant tote bags, comparing the merits of roasted chickpeas and chickpea chips, sampling from a limitless buffet of snack bars, dips, lactose-free ice cream, and turkey & gravy-flavored potato chips (more on those later). It's like being on a cruise ship, with slightly less motion sickness.
What did I learn from Snack Attack?
First, you should never eat half of a chocolate babka before going to Snack Attack.
Second, the big trend in the world of snacking this year is health.
The room was not without its cinnamon rolls and Tastykake snack cakes, but most brands made a concerted effort to market snacks as having an aura of health about them. Gluten-free items made only a minor appearance, with the big focus being on protein, whole grains, and “all natural” ingredients. The snack food industry has seen millennials beat their chests and cry for quinoa, chia seeds, and acai berries, and by God, it’s responding. Here’s an overview of some of the notable nibbles. 
 
: At the head of the “snacks that are legitimately good for you” column sits this new cereal, basically a more legit version of what Wheaties is going for. It’s made from just stone-ground wheat, grown and milled in California, plus a touch of cane sugar and sea salt.  
: This super-sweet, crispy breed of apple is new to the U.S. market. I'm convinced that it’s going to be the “It” apple of 2015. It will make the Honeycrisp look like garbage.
: If you are a very conscientious snacker—somebody who chews on sunflower seeds and drinks unsweetened cranberry juice—these nuggets made from the soft, nutritious centers of hemp seeds are for you. They are loaded with protein and omegas and will probably make you live forever.  
: These fruit and veggie popsicles in flavors like Planetary Pink Lemonade (organic butternut squash, strawberry, lemon juice) and Gravity Grape (organic grapes, sweet potatoes, blueberry, and açai) are gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan, with no added sugar, no GMOs, and they’re loaded with healthy probiotics. Ruby Rocket’s for President!
: Jerky used to be just a scary gas station snack, but thanks to Paleo dieters, it’s the cold-pressed juice of 2015. As such, it comes as no surprise to see a San Francisco startup making “artisan” beef, pork, turkey, and chicken jerky free from artificial ingredients in flavors like “chili basil” and “rosemary citrus.” 
: These win the “superfoods bingo” award for managing to cram the greatest number of trendy ingredients into a single-serving snack bar, including coconut sugar, quinoa, chia, amaranth, pomegranate, and flax seeds. Mazel tov! This is the bar to beat for superfood junkies.
: In case you're not eating enough Greek yogurt, Chobani has 800 new varieties to satisfy every “yogurt occasion”: breakfast, afternoon snack, dessert. Yogurts with fruits and oats, 100-calorie yogurts, yogurts with decadent mix-ins. Yogurts for when you’re sitting on the bus, talking on the phone, or posting BuzzFeed articles to Facebook. You're missing out on so many opportunities to eat yogurt right now!
 
: 7-Eleven wants to be known for more than just Slurpees and armed robberies, so it's launched a line of healthy and deftly on-trend snacks: sprouted tortilla chips in flavors like Sriracha, Sweet Potato, Multigrain, and Sweet Chili. Jerkies. Yogurt bars. If millennials want it, 7-Eleven’s got it!
: What's better than plain old hummus? Pizza hummus! It's almost as good as pizza.
  
: Also in the category of “foods that taste like other food,” these kettle chips in “Turkey & Gravy” and “Pumpkin Pie” flavors are perfect for when you’re craving a homemade dinner but don’t have any loved ones to make it for you. Now there’s a potato chip for that. Problem solved.
: Sliding further toward the “treat yo’self” end of the snack spectrum, remember Teddy Grahams? The good people at Honey Maid have taken those adorable bear-shaped cookies and made them in a “Birthday Cake” flavor. Lest we fear they are basically like eating cookies dipped in confetti cake batter, I was hastily informed that they have 8 grams of whole grains, are low in trans fat, and high in calcium. (
—they’re basically like eating cookies dipped in confetti cake batter.)
: Obviously confetti cake is having a moment, because Entenmann’s has turned out its own mini “party cakes” (read: confetti cakes) in handy single-serving packages. They're perfect for any time you want to give your kids a bag of cake.
 
: This dip tastes of heavy cream, powdered onion, and sadness. It’s the kind of snack that will get you through a broken engagement, sudden unemployment, or an entire season of 
. 

=== Title: How to Use Instagram to Invest in Art - Bloomberg ===

As he looked through Instagram at home in Copenhagen, Peter Ibsen noticed paintings by French artist Baptiste Caccia that were bound for an art fair in Brussels. 
“I wrote something like ‘very nice’ on the feed, and 10 minutes later his gallery called me,” Ibsen said. Thirty minutes later, he bought the painting.
Instagram, which has amassed 300 million active users since it was started in 2010, is emerging as an important tool for galleries to sell artworks. More collectors are using the photo-sharing app to search for works and make purchases. For artists, Instagram is emerging as a promotional tool.
Facebook  and Instagram are considered the two most important social media channels in the art world, according to the 2015 Online Art Trade Report by Hiscox, the London-based fine-art insurers. According to its survey, 69 percent of 519 respondents who have been collecting for less than three years said they use Instagram for art-related purposes.
“In the old days, I would never have found the work” by Caccia, Ibsen says. “I wasn’t in Brussels. I wouldn’t have had the chance to buy it.”
Ibsen said he’s bought as many as 15 artworks through the app in the past three years. He bought the Caccia from 
, a gallery from which he previously purchased another work by the same artist. Caccia’s works range from €3,000 ($3,370) to €9,000, according to the Brussels gallery.
“It’s not uncommon for us to have people inquire about a work because they saw it on Instagram,” said Damien Bertelle-Rogier, the founder of Super Dakota. “I try to curate our Instagram to represent the spirit of the gallery, and sometimes collectors respond quite well to it.”
Alexander Hertling the co-owner of 
, a gallery with branches in Paris and New York, says that his gallery has sold colorful, graphic wall sculptures that range from €9,000 to €40,000 on Instagram.
 
“We start a conversation, and then we sell it,” Hertling said in a telephone interview. “You can’t sell something for €500,000 on Instagram. But you can sell a young artist who makes colorful, readable works.”
Dealers and collectors also used Instagram during last month’s Berlin Gallery Weekend and at art fairs in New York. “Collectors follow other collectors,” said Tanya Leighton, whose 
 bears her name. “They don’t have to have a coffee in the VIP lounge of Frieze, they can just sign on and see what everyone else is interested in."
Instagram has become a democratic feature in the art world, offering outsiders access to the latest trends in the tight-knit world of dealers, artists, and collectors. Artists are using the app to promote their work, even if they shy away from the sales and marketing aspects.
“My relationship to Instagram is just to give an idea of who I am,” says Kadar Brock, who has 1,230 followers on Instagram and is represented by London’s 
. “I share dumb insider jokes but then also show studio shots and in-process shots.”
, an artist represented by the Denny Gallery on New York’s Lower East Side, says she’s been contacted by multiple collectors but directs them to her gallery.
The trend has its drawbacks. “Instagramable” works can draw more attention at the expense of more subtle, or difficult, art. According to the Hiscox survey, 74 percent of respondents said they were influenced by posts from other art collectors.
“What I’ve seen happen is maybe collectors will post two works they’re considering,” says Leighton. “They’ll see which one gets more likes, and then they’ll come back and say, ‘OK, I want this one.”
Social media is likely to play an important role in driving future online sales, according to the Hiscox report. In its survey, 41 percent of respondents said they discovered an online art sales platform through social media, up from 34 percent last year.
There’s a concern that artists may feel pressured to create works that look good on the app, which in turn affects the type of art being created.
“Artists play the game because they have to survive,” says Super Dakota’s Bertelle-Rogier. “Some artists are the darlings of the art world at the moment because of Instagram.”
 

=== Title: The Surprisingly Risque World of Society Painter John Singer Sargent - Bloomberg ===

It’s easy to peg John Singer Sargent—whose best-known portraits are of stiff-backed children and elaborately dressed socialites drowning in tulle—as a fluffy society painter of the rigid late-Victorian era. To wit, the biggest scandal of his career involved a portrait of “Madame X,” aka socialite Virginie Amelie Avegno Gautrea, with a lasciviously draped dress strap falling onto her shoulder. (
)
But Sargent (1856–1925) was infinitely more freewheeling than his better-known works would imply. In the exhibition 
, which opens on June 30 at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, a different kind of painter emerges.
“The show demonstrates that he moved very easily through these circles of progressive society,” says Stephanie Herdrich, who co-curated the show. “Many gay men, flamboyant performers, intellectuals, he was very comfortable with all of them.”
There are 91 portraits of just these characters in the show (along with another 21 drawings from the Met’s collection), which range from the famous—Claude Monet, Robert Louis Stevenson, W.B. Yeats, and Henry James—to random characters whom Sargent encountered as he bounced around Europe and North America. We’ve chosen a few of the most notable examples, the radical feminists and captains of industry and flamenco dancers, who present a neat alternative to Sargent’s reputation as a fussy painter of the upper crust.
 
The Parisian Samuel-Jean Pozzi palled around with royalty and wrote one of the first major textbooks on gynecological surgery. He was an early patron of Sargent, and, among other things, collected antiquities, sculpture, and tapestries. Viewers of the portrait, where the doctor lounges in a crimson bathrobe while fingering his lapel, will probably not be surprised to learn that he was also considered “a sensualist and an aesthete,” according to the catalog.
 
Vernon Lee (a pseudonym for Violet Paget) was described by Henry James as “the most able mind in Florence.” A childhood friend of Sargent’s, Lee preferred an androgynous appearance and name “partly to further her career,” says Herdrich. “She had ambition.” She also apparently had ambivalence about the nature of pictures themselves, writing to her publisher “I hate the hawking about of people’s faces.”
 
The normally reserved Met Museum catalog has a field day with Mrs. George Batten, noting that “she lived life in the fast lane, becoming the lover of, among many others, The Prince of Wales and the poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt.” It goes on to note that she is “best remembered today for her long lesbian affair with Radclyffe Hall, the author of the famous and controversial novel 
.”
“Let’s just say she was adventuresome,” says Herdrich. “Of course, we don’t want to be too sensationalistic.”
 
Sargent’s sexual orientation “has been discussed a lot,” says Herdrich. “We don’t have any real evidence that he had a relationship with a man, but what we do have is his body of work.” She cites this portrait of the young, independently wealthy W. Graham Robertson. “This is speculation, but there’s an aspect to him that Sargent finds so appealing. There’s an attraction to him that manifests itself in the painting.” In his memoirs, Robertson recalled that his poodle, Mouton (painted here with a bow in his hair), would regularly bite Sargent during sittings.
 
Léon Delafosse, whose patron was Comte Robert de Montesquiou, was a celebrated pianist and composer and friend of the Parisian beau monde, including Proust. “Sargent was so intimately a part of these circles,” Herdrich says. “We think of him quickly dashing off society portraits, but he was deliberately seeking out these intellectuals.” Still, there was a question of accessories. As Sargent wrote to a friend: “Of course Delafosse is a decadent especially in the matter of neck-ties—but he is a very intelligent little Frenchman.”
 
Born Carmen Dauset, the woman better known as “La Carmencita” was the talk of New York. Sargent would arrange parties specifically for La Carmencita to dance for his friends. He was only able to convince her to pose for him by “giving her jewelry to encourage her,” says Herdrich. There’s actually an extant video of 
, which was taken in Thomas Edison’s studio in New Jersey and has been archived by the Library of Congress.
 
Edwin Booth was a famous American thespian, best known for his Shakespearean roles. He also happened to be the brother of John Wilkes Booth, a man known for a different sort of engagement with the theater (he shot Abraham Lincoln in the head during a production of 
 at Ford’s Theatre). While John Wilkes Booth was killed in a burning barn, his brother went on to relative fame and fortune, as evidenced by what Herdrich calls a “huge” portrait of Booth at the Players Club in New York.
 
Charles Deering was an amateur painter who was also the heir to the founder of the International Harvester Company of Chicago. While he spent his youth traveling around Europe, he eventually returned to America to “take over the family business,” says Herdrich. Deering, who was lifelong friends with Sargent, had a massive art collection, parts of which he kept in a castle in Spain. This portrait “is relatively unique. It’s almost a formal portrait, but outdoors.”
 
There’s a reason this portrait of Eleonora Duse (known as “La Dusa”) looks unfinished. After Sargent finally convinced her to sit for a portrait, La Dusa, famously a rival of Sarah Bernhardt, got bored after 55 minutes. According to the catalog, Sargent related that she stood up and said, “I wish you a thousand years of life, glory, and many children, but now goodbye,” and then walked out, never to return.

=== Title: This Ulysse Nardin Watch Is Hiding a Powerful Secret - Bloomberg ===

Ulysse Nardin is no stranger to unusual watchmaking technology. Its well-known 
 line combines an innovative new gear train with an out-there design, where you can see much of the movement on the watch’s face. But not every Ulysse Nardin timepiece wears everything on its sleeve. The new 
 looks traditional enough from a distance, but that escapement down at 6 o’clock is anything but plain.
The watch starts with a basic 44-millimeter rose or white gold case that has gently curved lugs and a slim bezel. Long, antique-style blued steel hands move across a 
 enamel dial, which means the white enamel was fired at a temperature upwards of 800C (1,472F). The result is a smooth, slightly glossy finish that perfectly offsets the curly black numerals. Note: They’re not the same flourish-laden Breguet numerals used by many brands, but an entirely different font. It’s not 
, but it’s plenty elegant for any occasion.
Where things get really interesting, though, is in that large aperture at 6 o’clock. The one-minute tourbillon houses the proprietary Ulysse Anchor Escapement, which is what’s called a constant force escapement. In most watches, as the power winds down, the force delivered to the escapement flags, and as a result accuracy suffers. A constant force escapement does exactly what it sounds like: It delivers consistent rates of power for all seven days of the power reserve. Add the fact that all the components are silicium (resistant to damage and friction), and you have one very accurate timekeeping system packed into a few millimeters.
I’m sure some of you out there are thinking something like, Wait, why are we so excited about innovation in what is essentially an obsolete technology? And, sure, we don’t need more advanced mechanical timekeeping now that we have accurate quartz and atomic clocks, but if this kind of thing doesn’t get you excited, mechanical watches might not be for you. I suggest you track down a Ulysse Anchor Tourbillon, watch that tiny, delicate-yet-powerful escapement beat away, and then tell me you’re still not interested. I don’t think I’ll be hearing from anyone anytime soon.
The Anchor Tourbillion is priced at $84,400 in rose gold and $93,600 in white gold. Only 18 numbered pieces will be made in each metal, and they’ll go on sale later this year.

=== Title: Audemars Piguet Unveils Watch Honoring Racer Michael Schumacher - Bloomberg ===

Audemars Piguet's Concept series includes some pretty crazy watches. There's a white ceramic GMT-tourbillon and one of the world's loudest minute repeaters. Now we can add the Royal Oak Concept Laptimer Michael Schumacher to the list. It's a new kind of split-seconds chronograph made from space-age materials that was created in collaboration with the legendary Formula 1 driver. Buckle up, things are about to get complicated.
This is far from the first watch to bear Michael Schumacher's name. The F1 champion made racing-inspired Speedmaster chronographs with Omega before introducing his first collection of 
 chronographs in late 2012. The color palette here is much more understated than it was on previous models, though, and you might not even realize it's a racer's watch at first glance.
In December 2013, 
 that sent him into a monthslong coma. It's unclear what his current condition is (the family is keeping things quite private), but a full recovery is not expected. The design of this watch was finalized before Schumacher's accident, and Audemars Piguet was prepared to table the project indefinitely, but the Schumacher family encouraged it to proceed anyway.
Now to the watch itself. The case has the familiar profile of the Audemars Piguet Concept series, with the large angular lugs and beefy 44mm diameter. This one is rendered in forged carbon (a compressed carbon composite) with a brushed titanium bezel sitting on top. Accenting this are chronograph pushers and a crown made from a mix of black ceramic and rose gold, adding a little color to the otherwise stark appearance. This looks like a sports watch from the future.
As you'd expect from a watch bearing Schumacher's name, this is a specialist racing chronograph. It's technically a split-seconds chronograph but with some extra functionality to make it easier to time racing laps. When you start the timer with the pusher at 2 o'clock, the two hands start together (one on top of the other, as with any split). If you want to use the watch like a normal flyback chronograph, you can hit the pusher at 4 o'clock to bring both hands back to zero while they start timing another lap immediately. Simple enough, right?
It gets complicated when you hit the pusher at 9 o'clock. This locks one hand where it is and returns the other to zero while starting it again immediately. This lets you read the time of the first lap while also timing a second lap. From there you can either fly back just the one hand in motion or use the pusher at 9 again to lock the moving hand and return the locked hand to zero for more timing. 
Making this all possible is the totally insane caliber 2923 movement. Seriously, this one is nuts. The openworked dial lets you see the elaborated, skeletonized, and blacked-out movement in all its glory. There are 413 total components, three column wheels for controlling the chronograph functions, and 80 hours of power reserve. I saw an early version of this movement being constructed at Audemars Piguet's headquarters and can tell you from firsthand experience it's about as elaborate and technically complex as mechanical watchmaking gets.
Beyond the racing-specific complication, there are a few other nods to Schumacher on the watch. On the left side of the case and the bottom of the caseback are black tonal "MS" signatures, with the one on the side accompanied by seven stars symbolizing Schumacher's seven world championship titles. Also, the watch is a limited edition and is being produced in 221 examples, one for each point-winning F1 race of Schumacher's carer. Overall these are subtle nods that will appeal to the diehards but won't distract for those who want something less obviously tied to the racer.
The Royal Oak Concept Laptimer Michael Schumacher is limited to 221 pieces and is priced at $229,500. Distribution will be limited to flagship boutique locations, which include New York and Bal Harbour in the U.S.

Two new Asian restaurants have just opened in London.

=== Title: Montblanc to Apple: Our Swiss Smartwatch Will Outlast Yours - Bloomberg ===

 By the end of the decade, smartwatches from Apple Inc. and others might elicit guffaws rather than envy. At least that’s the view of Montblanc’s Alexander Schmiedt, who’s developed an electronic watchband for Swiss luxury timepieces that tracks steps, reads emails and even helps take selfies.
The speed at which gadgets evolve poses a design challenge to the four-century-old Swiss watchmaking industry, Schmiedt, Montblanc’s managing director for watches, said in an interview. High-end wristwatches are made to last, while electronic devices become disposable within years, as seen in the demise of the 1980s calculator watch.
“Our products should have very long life cycles,” Schmiedt said at Montblanc’s watch factory, housed in an Art Nouveau villa in the rural Swiss town of Le Locle. “In modern technologies the life cycle is exactly the opposite. It may be the hottest thing today, and in one year it’s already outdated, and in two years you’re made fun of for still using it.”
Montblanc, owned by South African billionaire Johann Rupert’s Richemont, has created a luxury item with high-tech appeal by putting the electronics in the watchband rather than the timepiece. Montblanc’s $390 “e-Strap” goes on sale next month and accompanies its TimeWalker watches, which cost $3,700 to $5,800. Richemont will probably only embed technology in watchbands, Rupert said on a conference call about full-year earnings announced Friday.
Rupert owns almost every product Apple Inc. has made and was the first agent selling Apple devices in South Africa decades ago, he said.
“I love Apple, but just when I’ve gone and set everything up for an iPhone 5, the iPhone 6 is coming out and the cords change,” he said. “That is not to say the Apple Watch is not a great product. I predict it will do very well, but I don’t think that customers are going to be ecstatic to throw away watches in one to two years when the technology is obsolete.”
The device is the first luxury Swiss product to directly compete with the Apple Watch, which costs $349 for the most basic version and $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model. The e-Strap and compatible timepieces will appear in Montblanc boutiques and retailers such as Bloomingdale’s in the U.S.
“The pricing is reasonable,” said Patrik Schwendimann, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank. “If it turns out to be just a fad, at least the consumer still has a nice, normal watch they can continue to wear.”
The e-Strap consists of a stainless steel display attached via a leather strap and designed to be on the backside of the wrist when the watch is on the front. A two-line touchscreen displays e-mails when they arrive.
When connected to a smartphone, Montblanc’s device can select songs and jump through playlists. It has an activity tracker that allows users to set targets for calories burned and steps taken. The e-Strap can also trigger the phone’s camera, facilitating easier “selfie” shots and group photos.
The watchband is compatible with phones from Samsung, Apple and others. The e-Strap also has a function to help the wearer find the watch or smartphone as long as they’re in a 30-meter (98-foot) range. It needs a recharge every five days.
While it does make a Swiss watch smart, the e-Strap isn’t flawless, according to Mario Ortelli, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London.
“There are also disadvantages: fewer functionalities, smaller screen, less integration with other devices,” he said, although those issues will probably be addressed. “It will probably evolve significantly in the future.”
Swiss smartwatches are on the way, with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE’s $1,400 TAG Heuer smartwatch slated to reach consumers this year. Swatch will introduce a New Gent timepiece with mobile payment functions for less than $100 by August. IWC Schaffhausen -- another brand owned by Richemont, whose full name is Cie. Financiere Richemont SA -- also plans an intelligent watchband.
Schmiedt has said he hopes the Apple Watch will succeed because it boosts consumer interest in timepieces. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.
A second-generation e-Strap could include GPS functions, more elaborate activity-tracking and a more interactive touch screen, Schmiedt said. Montblanc will provide free software updates for at least two years.
With a flick of the wrist, the e-Strap can disappear to the other side of the cuff, keeping it discrete, the executive said: “They can decide when and how to use it, instead of it always being in their face.”

=== Title: Breva Génie 03 Puts a Mechanical Speedometer on Your Wrist - Bloomberg ===

To figure out speed from your wristwatch, you typically use a tachymeter scale. It's what race car drivers and pilots used for decades before digital timers emerged. Now 
 has a different solution inside its 
: an actual 
 speedometer that functions independently from the timekeeping mechanism.
It's not the most practical complication, sure, but I couldn't help but smile as I tested the prototype with a noisy air compressor in a buttoned-up Geneva hotel.
The 45-part mechanism must be deployed from the case (using the screw-down pusher at 2 o'clock) before it can be used. Once it has popped out, it stands 6 millimeters above the rest of the case and features an exposed set of Robinson cups, which are more commonly used to measure wind speeds. This a different approach than that used by the mechanical barometers and mechanical altimeters in Breva's other watches, which rely on pressurized membranes. 
The air coming from the 1 o'clock direction (chosen for the angle of the wrist on a motorcycle's handlebars or a car's steering wheel) spins the Robinson cups. Eventually this force overcomes the tension in the visible spring, moving the needle to show speed in kilometers per hour. If we weren't talking on a millimeter scale, the mechanics would be really simple, but here it's well-deserving of a slow clap. I can't speak to how it works with your arm resting on the windowsill of a GTO, but using an air pressure gun to test it, the system was responsive and easy to read.
The real question is: Who wants or needs a speedometer on their wrist? The short answer is nobody. With a gadget like this, utility isn't the point.
If you're part of the large demographic obsessed with both watches and motorsports (you know who you are), this is sure to hold a lot of appeal. It's a racing watch unlike any other—even your friend with the perfect vintage Aston hasn't seen the likes of this.
Oh, and yeah, the Génie 03 tells time, too. 
This is the first movement Breva has developed entirely in-house; its unusual crescent shape allows space for the speedometer. The transparent dial has three hands for hours, minutes, and seconds, and you can see the balance wheel above and power barrel below, too. Turning the watch over, you see the micro-rotor winding system, which makes the Génie 03 automatic. Even with the speedometer deployed, the movement compartment of the case is water-resistant, so you don't have to worry about accidentally hurting the watch when you use the complication.
The 44.7mm x 15.7mm case is rather large, but it hugs the wrist nicely and feels much smaller than the specs would suggest. Also, the combination of being made of titanium and all the open space inside for the speedometer makes it rather light for its size. The Génie 03 still isn't subtle by any means, but it's more wearable than you'd think.
There are certainly those who will scoff that the Génie 03 is frivolous and useless. Fine, I see where you're coming from. But to ignore the creativity, mechanical ingenuity, and spirit of enjoyment would be to seriously miss what Breva has achieved.

=== Title: Greggs vs Pret vs Marks & Spencer: It's The Real British Bake-Off - Bloomberg ===

Times are good at Greggs Plc – 
as it competes with expensive sandwich shops with a healthier menu, casting aside an image for being heavy on the stomach if light on the pocketbook.
So how does 
, which built an empire on pasties and sausage rolls, compare with posher retailers at a time of rising interest in better eating?
I bought a selection of sandwiches and cakes from Greggs, 
and 
 and asked chef Anna Hansen to put them to the test at her new London restaurant, the

(While the items aren't directly comparable, I picked a representative sample. I couldn't find a ham & cheese baguette at Marks & Spencer and only found a low-calorie tuna sandwich; the cakes, in particular,  were different at each retailer.)
Here's how it went – verdict at the end.
"It looks quite nice. Nice bit of greenery. Plenty of ham. Plenty of mustard mayo. Bit skimpy on the cheese by the look of it. Quite tasty. The baguette's a bit soggy though. It's too chewy. I like it with a bit of crunch. The flavors are good. Nice ham. The cheese could do with a little bit more punch."
"I don’t understand bread like this. It is pretending to be healthy. It's wholemeal but to me just tastes gritty. I'd rather just have an honest white loaf or something that is truly seeded. There is no mustard on this which I would expect on a ham-and-cheese sandwich. The filling is very generous but the mayonnaise is coating on my tongue. I'm not a fan of that one."
"This is quite well-filled. It doesn’t look like there's any mustard in here, either. The baguette is nice and crunchy. The cheese has probably got the best flavor of all the cheeses: It stands up against the ham. The ham is probably not the tastiest, but the general standard is pretty good overall."
"This visually looks the most appealing. That's actually not bad. It's nicely seasoned. It's nice to have that rocket, that little bit of pepperiness. The bread's OK. It's the only one I would pay money for."
"No mayo? What's the point? I'm a full-fat kind of a girl. That is actually horrible. It is just bland, soggy and it is like eating sawdust. The tuna doesn't even taste of tuna, sorry."
"There's plenty of filling, which - if it tastes nice - will be a good thing.
"That isn’t very nice either. The aftertaste is very metallic. It tastes like the tin, or something."
"That's OK. Vanilla-ey. Nice. The pastry's not quite flaky enough but the flavor is OK. It's just a little bit claggy. I wouldn’t buy this."
"This looks quite appetizing. Nice bit of glaze. End-of-the-season raspberries but there's redcurrants as well. You can hear it's nice and crispy. Hmm. It's quite nice, quite tasty. It looks kind of homemadeish but the puff pastry just does have a bit of that mass-produced taste, which it obviously is. (Laughs.)
"I'd buy that. My mum would love that. shame she's not here. It's got a lovely look and the crème pat is actually quite nice and the fruit is nice, just gives it that little bit of tart. It looks beautiful."
"Someone stole the filling. Where has it gone? That's not so nice. All I really get is dried doughiness with this icing. It is really sweet and the apple doesn’t come through. It would be nice if it had big chunks of apple. The ratio's not right. This is all too sweet. The apple needs to have a bit of body, a bit of tanginess and a bit of texture. It's just a bit of a mush. You can't really tell what you're eating. It could be anything."
"It looks a little bit like someone got their Nescafe granules and sprinkled them on top before putting it in the oven. It's crispy, nice. Quite a pleasant surprise. Oooh. Lots of chocolate. It tastes OK. It is quite flaky but it's a bit soggy, weirdly. There is plenty of the chocolate filling but it looks a bit weird. I wouldn’t buy that unless it was what was left and I was hungry."
"That looks like somebody's fingernails. Oh dear. Just the feel of it is wrong. It is like something that comes out of one of those long-life packets, like a doughnut that lasts for six months and you wonder why, how that's actually possible. I don't think that's cooked properly. It's doughy. Way too sweet. The dough itself is way too sweet, like one of those packet cake mixes."
"That looks like at least it's been in the deep fryer which is where all doughnuts should have been, in my opinion. Sorry, I was expecting whipped cream but it's butter cream icing. The doughnut itself is actually OK. That filling is hideous.  The icing is a bit much as well."
British favorite Marks & Spencer was let down by that misfit low-cal sandwich and the cheap doughnut I chose. Greggs put in a good show and cost the least, while Pret, a staple of the London office-worker lunch, will be pleased to have won the respect of the chef.
 

=== Title: How Does Tesla’s ‘Ludicrous Mode’ Stack Up Against Bugatti, Lamborghini? - Bloomberg ===

On Friday Tesla mastermind Elon Musk 
 for his electric Model S sedan and the upcoming Model X SUV.
He promised that the new mode—a $10,000 option—would push the car to 60 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds. He said it will get the SUV to 60mph in 3.3 seconds.
That’s serious speed, on par with supercars that are exponentially more expensive. If Musk can pull this off, it’ll shoot him into the same stratosphere as Bugatti and Koenigsegg.
What’s more, Musk said he’ll launch an all-new Roadster in four years. That one will have a “maximum plaid” speed mode—a reference to the cult favorite movie, 
.
Who knows what max plaid is, but it sounds nuts.
So how does Telsa stack up against other top high-speed cars in the world, both in terms of 0-60 and price tag?

For anyone bearish on the progress made by the U.S. economy, consider this: Computers are now one-1,100th of their price 35 years ago. 

=== Title: Best Watch Straps for a Sweat-Free Summer - Bloomberg ===

When it's 90 degrees outside, wearing a padded crocodile watch strap is no less insane than putting on a parka. Yeah, yeah, you're man enough to handle having a sweaty wrist. But what about when that $600 piece of hide starts harboring major funk? Didn't think so. (And your main BBQ mate agrees.) Plus, don't even think about jumping in the pool with a leather strap, unless you're ready to throw it out as you towel off.
Instead, swap in one of these four summer-ready materials and start enjoying casual weekends with breezy ease.
 
Perlon is real insider watch-nerd stuff. These 
 are cheap, colorful, and about as low maintenance as a watch strap can get, but for some reason they've been almost entirely unknown outside of continental Europe until a year or so ago. You just thread them through your watch's spring bars and stick the pin through the weave wherever it's comfortable. Sure, the buckles are a little tinny, and the weave stretches out over time, but for just a little more cash than a Tubman (
), they're essentially disposable. Order in bulk. I'm wearing one as I type this and expect I'll be wearing another one tomorrow. 
 
The NATO is the original all-terrain, wet-dry watch strap. These basic nylon bands were developed for military divers, and "007" himself has sported one on multiple occasions. 
 carries them in a ton of colors and patterns, so don't feel wed to the traditional gray and black stripes. Just like the Perlon straps, they thread right through the bars on your watch (no tool required) and can be hot-swapped in just a few seconds. They're usually on the long side, so you just tuck the extra back through the metal loops and act like it's all part of the look. Yes, they may have developed a bit of a hipster rep since everyone from Urban Outfitters to J Crew started selling them, but don't sweat it: NATOs are too good at keeping you cool to avoid because of something like that. 
 
While not the most waterproof, a canvas strap like the 
 can provide a bit more formality while still giving you the comfort of a NATO or Perlon (especially in black). Some people swear by the super-worn-in canvas look, leather accents and all, like something salvaged from a WWII battle site—but I don't buy it. Minimal and cleanly finished straps will take you more places. For example, the above is still olive drab, but with clean matching stitching and just enough padding that it won't lose its shape after a few wears. It's all about that balance. 
It might sound as if a rubber watch strap would become a sweaty mess, but they wear cool and don't retain moisture so your wrist isn't swimming. What's actually shocking is how difficult it is to find a good one. If you're in the market for a rose gold Yachmaster, get the 
. For everyone else there's Switzerland's 
. Its thick molded rubber straps are insanely comfortable, totally waterproof, hypoallergenic, and custom fit for a variety of other Rolex and Panerai watches (don't worry, generics are available if you're sporting something else). Steer clear of the rubber-lined leather and exotic straps: They're not as elegant as plain skin nor as utilitarian as 100-percent rubber. You won't be getting the full benefits of either. 
 

=== Title: Tudor Makes a Watch for the Die-Hard Vintage Collector - Bloomberg ===

People who collect vintage watches love vintage watches. And, usually, they want modern watches to be more like vintage watches. With the strangely named Heritage Black Bay "Black," Tudor is giving all those fans exactly what they've been clamoring for.
A little history helps this watch make a lot more sense. The first Tudor Submariner dive watch hit wrists in 1954 and had a lot in common with early Rolex dive watches of the same era. Over the next three decades, Tudor made a series of Submariner dive watches in various colors with differing design details. In 2012, Tudor introduced the Heritage Black Bay, a modern dive watch that pays homage to the military Submariners of the 1970s with snowflake-style hands, gold dial printing, and a subdued red bezel (inspired by a faded model in the company archive). 
This even newer version starts with the same 41mm stainless steel case, still displays just the hours, minutes, and seconds, and is still meant to be an everyday watch that can take a beating. It's the colors that are unique, and that's a bigger deal than you might think. The dial is a deep black with a gilt chapter ring marking the minutes at the outer edge. The same gold tint is used for the vintage-style Tudor logo and other info at the dial's center. The hands and borders of the hour markers are gold with a creamy luminous fill. The bezel is matte black and has a small red triangle around the glowing pearl at 12 o'clock. The all-black color scheme with the gold printing is a direct homage to that 1954 Submariner, down to that little red triangle. In fact, the triangle's probably the most important detail here: It's an historic quirk that's unnoticeable to most but tells the hard-core collectors that Tudor made this watch just for them.
The Black Bay "Black" looks pretty similar to a one-of-a-kind Black Bay One being offered in 
. The latter watch looks even more like the first Tudor Submariner, with pencil-shaped hour and minute hands, a lollipop seconds hand, and minimal bezel markings. But at a casual glance it's easy to confuse that special charity watch with the "Black" market watch Tudor announced this week. It will be interesting to see if this negatively affects the sale price of the Black Bay One, since you can now get something very similar for a lot less money. A die-hard collector will still likely pay top dollar for the unique watch, but there's now an option for the rest of us, too.
In case you forgot, Tudor is also the sister brand of Rolex. The little sister. Because Tudor has a more laid-back vibe and doesn't have the same totemic status to uphold, it can experiment a little more than Rolex. The big question is whether this experimentation will flow upstream eventually. Will we be seeing a vintage-inspired Submariner or a new Daytona that resembles the chronographs of the '70s? I think short term the answer is probably no, but one can always dream.
The Tudor Heritage Black Bay "Black" comes on either an aged black leather strap ($3,100) or a stainless steel bracelet ($3,425), both of which come with a black fabric strap, too. It will be available at Tudor retailers starting on Oct. 15.

=== Title: So Who Won at the 2015 Oscars of Watchmaking? - Bloomberg ===

Thursday evening in Geneva, the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève (GPHG) awards were held in the city’s Grand Théâtre. These are the Oscars of fine watchmaking. The nominees 
 in July, and then 
 in September, but now the waiting is over. According to 
 of 26 watchmakers, journalists, and industry experts, these are the best watches of 2015.
No surprises here. It wasn’t a shoo-in, but there’s no question Greubel Forsey is making some of the best watches on the planet right now. This is probably the most wearable model the company has made to date. It was one of 
 back in January, and I’m still impressed every time I see it. Bravo.
Most of the watches in this category are creations you wouldn’t want to wear on a daily basis but might want to encounter in a gallery. This Villeret Cadran Shakudo is right in line with that aesthetic, and the multicolored, multilayered engraving on the dial is unlike anything else you can find in a wristwatch.
This watch wowed journalists and collectors 
, and I would’ve been shocked had it not taken this category. The combination of a perpetual calendar, a second time zone, a beautiful moon phase, and custom art deco numerals make this a watch you can’t help but want to wear.
 
Ultrathin is what Piaget is all about, and until this year the brand’s slim lineup didn’t include a chronograph. There were more complicated and ornate chronographs in the category, but the judges seem to have gone with something people really want to wear. I totally agree with their choice.
Looking at this, you might not guess it’s from the same company that makes the Royal Oak and Millenary, but there you have it. The stonework is astounding, and even if it’s not your type of watch, you can’t ignore just how skilled the artisans are who make it.
If the jury steered toward the wearable in other categories, here they went for the most outlandish pick. The dial and band here feature hand embroidery in a pattern that mixes flowers and skulls. Not exactly subtle, but oh so very Hublot.
Often complications are developed for men’s watches and are then adapted for ladies’ models. This time display, though—using a peacock and rotating disks—was created for this watch, which combines gem settings, mother-of-pearl dial work, and mechanical complexity.
The little bird in that bubble flutters its wings and chirps when you push the lone button on the case. It’s uncanny and sounds just like the real thing. The idea is taken from 18th century automata, shrunk down to fit on the wrist.
Kari Voutilainen and his team make very few watches each year; the finishing on each tiny movement component and dial element is top-tier and inspired by traditional pocket watches. The overall look of the watches, though, is thoroughly modern and distinctive.
In a category focused on relatively lower prices, the judges didn’t compromise on quality. The Felix includes Habring2’s first in-house movement designed and made in Austria, and the clean looks make it something you can wear every day. This is a real watch guy’s watch.
The Pelagos isn’t new, but Tudor updated it with a bright blue color scheme and also added its in-house movement earlier this year. The new model is equal parts indestructible and innovative. No one can argue with this award.
The exaggerated gold bridges are a signature of Girard-Perregaux, but the mechanism they’re supporting is totally new. The open dial lets you really admire the complex chiming mechanism that makes this watch special.
Ulysse Nardin, known more for its ornate and over-the-top watches, this time opts for technical innovation instead of brash aesthetics. The tourbillon also boasts a special escapement that further enhances accuracy and reliability over time. Plus, that enamel dial is super handsome.
Ferrier is a longtime veteran of Patek Philippe, and with his own brand he’s creating very high-end watches in small numbers. This is his first nonround watch, and it packs all the same technology in the movement as the round models.
This is 
. Full stop. It wasn’t nominated for anything (it wasn’t even announced until just a few weeks ago), but the jury decided to give it a special nod anyway.
This is the very first watch to combine three tourbillons in a single mechanism, and it was created by a father-son duo. The watch also received the Public Prize, voted for online not by the jury, but by the public. It was the only watch to win two awards.
If the Altiplano shows off Piaget’s watchmaking chops, this one shows off the brand’s jewelry skills. The cuff has two watches and multiple rings of diamonds, recalling vintage pieces from the company’s archive.

=== Title: Radical Chef Achatz Moves Chicago’s Alinea Restaurant to Madrid - Bloomberg ===

Chef Grant Achatz was in his early 30s, the father of two young boys, when he was diagnosed with stage four cancer of the tongue. (There is no stage five.)
He lost his sense of taste and the recommended treatment was amputation, which might give him a couple more years of life. It would be a devastating prospect for anyone and unimaginable for the Chicago-based chef, owner of 
, one of the world's greatest restaurants.
Instead, Achatz 
 at the 
 that involved a new drug as well as chemotherapy and radiation. Seven years later, sitting in Alinea for an interview, he looks fit and healthy, with no evidence of the disease since 2009.
He's now planning for the future, seeking to turn meals at Alinea - already innovative and dramatic - into a more theatrical and interactive experience. Alinea holds three Michelin stars and has won multiple accolades. It has been named Best Restaurant in North America in the 
 awards, and was named 
 by 
magazine. 
Achatz will close Alinea on Dec. 31 for a three-month refurbishment and move his entire team to Madrid for a 
.  (The first block of tickets went on sale on Oct. 13; the second will be released on Dec. 1 and the remaining 20 percent on Jan. 1.)
The first week will be a collaboration with David Muñoz , with one section of the meal in his 
 restaurant and the other in Alinea Madrid in the 
; the rest of the residency will be just in Alinea Madrid. Tickets for the former (from Jan. 12-16)  are 500 euros ($535) plus 10 percent tax; the latter (Jan. 19-Feb. 6) costs 275 euros plus tax.
(A second, monthlong residency in Miami has been agreed, says Achatz, who declines to give details before it is officially announced. Plans for New York didn't work out and Achatz says he didn’t receive any approaches for London.)
If you've never eaten at Alinea in Chicago – where diners must purchase a ticket in advance rather than pay on the day – you may have a long wait: every meal for the rest of the year (apart from New Year's Eve) is sold out. I dined at Alinea last week and the food was stunning. I shan't go through the 20 courses. Two desserts alone can demonstrate Achatz's creative approach to gastronomy as well as his showmanship.
In one (Milk Chocolate, Pate Sucree, Violet, Hazelnut), the chef pours, splashes, drips, smashes and sprinkles the components direct onto a special tablecloth, without the intervention of a plate. Your table top is like an edible abstract painting.
The other is a helium balloon made with green apple: You hold on with an edible string (also made with apple) then suck on the balloon to burst it, release the gas and have a 
moment. (For younger readers, the late Mr. Tim was best known for his falsetto rendition of Tiptoe Through the Tulips.)
If that sounds far out, Achatz and his executive chef, 
, are rethinking the whole concept of the meal for the Madrid residency, turning it into an more "experiential" event that will become the basis for a new-style Alinea when the restaurant reopens in Chicago.
One idea for Madrid is to start the evening in a room where small bags that hang from the ceiling contain elements that become part of an ambient meal, with diners making their way from room to room. The contents might include scissors along with herbs that need to be cut up and sprinkled over a dish.
The pop-up follows similar overseas residencies for Noma in Japan and for the 
, though Achatz says those residencies didn't influence him in deciding the move to Madrid.
Achatz is softly spoken and thoughtful. I wonder how cancer affected him as a person and as a chef?
"Significantly as a chef and less so as a person," says Achatz, 41. "People can handle those types of illnesses however they choose and I came to work every day. It's important everybody processes it in their own way. For me, personally, I didn’t want to recoil. I didn’t want to say, I need to spend more time with my friends my family. This is (the restaurant) my friends and family. I wanted to come into work.
"But what it did for me as a chef was significant. I was young when I got diagnosed and quite honestly I was still pretty immature as a cook, as a restaurateur. I still had that mentality that I had to do everything myself. So, like, if you were to come in for dinner I would want to cook every one of your dishes.
"But when I couldn’t taste any more, I had to rely on the team. I learned about delegation and trust by looking at the sous chefs and looking at the chefs de cuisine and being like, 'How does that taste?' The most basic thing that a chef can do is evaluate the food. I couldn’t do that, so I had to rely on them. I would be like, 'Does this need more salt?' It made me realize that they're all good, and in order for me to grow as a chef, in order for the restaurant to grow, that trust was essential."

=== Title: New Montblanc Heritage Chronometrie: SIHH 2016 - Bloomberg ===

Forget Christmas. Forget New Year's Eve. At this time of year, watch lovers are anxiously awaiting the Salon International de Haute Horlogerie (SIHH), the first major watch industry event of the year. Beginning on Jan. 18, more than 20 watchmakers will gather in Geneva to give retailers, journalists, and top collectors their first looks at what will be hitting wrists in 2016. Montblanc, though, has given us an early look at two new models it will be introducing in Switzerland, and (spoiler alert) they look great.
Over the last few years, under the 
, chief executive officer, Montblanc has been steadily ramping up its watch offerings, with a particular focus on bringing out complicated models at prices significantly lower than those of the competition. Last year there was the 
; the year before, it was a 
. Because Montblanc wasn't previously known for watchmaking, the brand is aggressively creating a narrative wherein it offers high quality products at reasonable prices. These watches continue this story.
The Heritage Chronométrie Date by Hand is a great entrée into the manufacture, despite the clumsy name. The 40 millimeter case is thin at just 9.85mm, making it an easy watch to wear with a suit or a sweater, and the red gold markers and hands add just enough bling to keep the dial from looking boring. The news here, though, is the new date display at 3 o'clock, which uses the less common dial with a hand, instead of the customary window. It is meant to resemble vintage chronographs, with the running seconds- and minute-totalizer registers, and I think it's a nice, slightly dressier option.
The big gun is the Heritage Chronométrie Chronograph Annual Calendar, which combines two useful complications in one package. Here, the case is a little bigger, at 42mm wide and 13.83mm thick. The two complications share registers, so you need to know what you're looking at. While the moonphase at 3 o'clock is somewhat obvious, down at 6 o'clock are the day of the week and the hours counter for the chronograph. Then, at 9 o'clock, you'll find the month and the chronograph's minutes counter, and up at 12 o'clock, the date and the running seconds. It's a little busy, but you get all the date info (and have to adjust it only once a year, at the end of February), plus a timer for your trouble.
After the most 
 in almost a decade, the industry (at least, some of it) is recalibrating. Customers are more educated than ever. Those opting for a mechanical timepiece instead of an Apple Watch want to know they're getting something of genuine horological value, though they're tired of paying prices inflated by years of a strong Swiss Franc and ballooning sales in Asia. 
Another nice touch is that both watches come in stainless steel and red gold, so you can opt for something with an everyday quality or a slightly special metal. The Montblanc Heritage Chronométrie Date By Hand will be priced at €2,790 ($3,050) in steel and €2,950 ($3,250) in gold, and the Annual Calendar Chronograph will be priced at €9,500 ($10,450) in steel and €18,900 ($20,700) in gold. Both watches will become available in early 2016; final retail prices might change before they hit stores, based on currency fluctuations.

=== Title: Nine Chicago Restaurants to Try: From a Monster Burger to Refined Midwest Fare - Bloomberg ===

Chicago is a great city for eating out, even though it lacks the gastronomic ambition and international reputation of New York.
There's a wide range of cuisines, the cooking is good, the prices are affordable and the service is friendly. Plus, it is a manageable size, with good public transportation. On a flying visit last week, to 
 I made a whistlestop tour of some hot dining spots. 
Here are some recommendations:
Danny Meyer, the New York restaurateur known for quality establishments such as 
 and 
, has just opened this 18th-floor restaurant with an outdoor terrace overlooking downtown Chicago. Green River, which celebrates the city's Irish-American culture, is a collaboration between 
 group and Meyer's 
.
The dining room is packed and buzzy at night, and there are standout cocktails. It's good to sit at one of the high tables beside the bar, which serves drinks such as the Tommy Gun ($13), which features Kappa Chilean pisco, pineapple, lime, garam masala and aromatic bitters.
The Midwestern menu (of chef Aaron Lirette) includes snacks and sharing plates, including a wonderful smoked whitefish tartine ($11), with sliced egg and shaved radishes and celery on rye. If the flavors were any cleaner, you'd be able to wash in them. The food is certainly accessible: Chicken oysters (fried in breadcrumbs) are noble nuggets; the frites in Cheddar dust are posh Pringles. The spicy beef tartare costs $14.
Lunch is a simpler affair with a stripped-down menu which, fortunately, includes the whitefish tartine. The steak frites ($21) are also a winner. The cut, 
 from 
, is tender and rich. It's simply served with herb butter and peppercorn sauce.
I enjoyed GreenRiver so much, I went twice. (Thereby reducing this Top 10 to a Top 9.)
This restaurant/bar is hugely popular. I queued for about 40 minutes for a stool behind the beer taps and counted myself lucky to get in. The hamburgers have been described by 
 as just about perfect, while the double cheeseburger ($12.95) is Best in America, according to 
. It actually contains three patties and is so dirty it should wash its mouth out. You have to open very wide just to get it in. But there is more to Au Cheval than burgers. Chef-restaurateur Brendan Sodikoff has worked with Alain Ducasse and Thomas Keller. He's very serious about his food. The menu features dishes such as roasted marrow bones, beef cheek marmalade and toast ($17.95). I would have ordered that if i'd ever made it through the burger.
This West Loop casual dining spot focuses on Asian barbecue. Chef Bill Kim, an alumnus of Charlie Trotter's, is backed here by basketball star Michael Jordan. The dining room has an industrial look whose sharp edges are smoothed by warm service and hot food. The flavors are big in dishes such as roasted pork butt (curry BBQ, Asian giardiniera) at $14 and belly mac n' cheese ($8). To be honest, I wasn't taken with the latter, which features thick noodles, Thai curry and cheddar. I took solace in cocktails such as 13th Assassin (
, coconut, egg white, Korean chili flake) and Kill Bill Vol. 1 (Sudachi Shochu, Passionfruit Drinking Vinegar, Mezcal) at $11 apiece.
 
This modern Mexican restaurant in Andersonville uses local ingredients - including some from a garden on the rooftop - to create dishes that are colorful and relatively light. 
studied regional cooking in Oaxaca, and her focus is on quality and flavor. I went along for brunch and have to confess I was most excited by the Green Bloody Mary ($7), which was one of the finest cocktails I enjoyed in Chicago. It was sour and spicy without being overpowering. The huevos divorciados ($8) - two eggs with individual salsa, black beans and sour cream - had depth and heat in equal measure. There were layers of flavor. Cantina 1910 is a huge place but was quiet on a Sunday morning.
This Logan Square cafe is particularly popular for brunch, with locals and visitors alike lining up for unfussy food that has gained national - and even international - attention over the past 16 years. (Among other accolades, Lula holds a Michelin Bib Gourmand.)  I went straight for the Tineka ($9): Indonesian-spiced peanut butter on seeded whole grain sourdough, tomato, cucumber, red onion and sprouts. The quality of the ingredients was memorable as was the balance of flavors. The house pastries include caramel apple Danish and almond pear coffee cake. The crowd is generally young and there's a laid-back vibe, but the food is serious and the service is focused.
This bar and restaurant atop the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel offers a great view of Millennium Park and Lake Michigan from an outdoor terrace. It's worth a visit for the views alone, though I did find time for a few glasses of wine. I'd eaten two brunches before reaching here so can't tell you much about the food. However, the two women beside me at the bar appeared to be enjoying the shellfish platter ($72) heaped high with lobster, oysters, king crab, white balsamic mignonette and bloody Mary cocktail sauce. (I stayed at the hotel and loved it.)
This award-winning restaurant and bar in the West Loop was packed, noisy and dark when I entered on a Saturday night. The staffers looked extremely busy but found time to sort out somewhere for me to eat, albeit standing at a counter. There's a large open kitchen serving an eclectic menu of boldly flavored dishes such as Sichuan goat satay (with goat dashi and smoked-apple puree) and escargot dumplings. Chicago-born Stephanie Izard is the chef behind this gutsy fare. If you want to know what umami is, I recommend the pan-fried shishito peppers with Parmesan, sesame and miso.
I really don't get Chicago deep-pan pizza. Or, rather, I didn't. I could almost be converted by Pequod's, whose pizzas have a thin, crispy rim that provides not only texture but sharp cheesy flavor. As for the toppings, the tomatoes I ordered were large and sweet, the peppers were hot and chunky and the bacon was fat and salty. You get so used to toppings being pureed and diced and baked into a colorful mosaic, it's a pleasure to get them big enough to bite into. The restaurant itself is like a sports bar, with brick walls, large-screen TVs and plenty of beer on tap. My bill, including drinks and tax, was $26.37.
This dark and noisy gastropub serves a wide range of draft and bottled beers. The main attraction for me was the food, which is Indian. Having tried that cuisine in New York, I didn't set my expectations too high and I was pleasantly surprised. Chicago has an Indian community and plenty of restaurants, centered on Devon Avenue. Here, buttered paneer ($12) came as a spicy gravy with salted chili, served with a whole-wheat paratha on the side. The menu is limited but the food packs a punch that makes it great with beer.

=== Title: Monday Morning Find: 23 Incredible Rolex Watches - Bloomberg ===

With the annual Baselworld watch show 
, my head is saturated with 
.
It's time for some serious vintage watch therapy.
So instead of bringing you one great watch this week, I've found 23. Yes, almost two dozen Rolexes of all types, and every single one of them comes with its original box and paperwork. Monday's not so bad now, is it?
In addition to the traditional auctions it hosts around the globe, Christie's also has a private sales department in New York City as well as an online watch shop. The 
 hosts online auctions and has a rotating collection of watches available for immediate purchase. Typically the selection of immediate buys is varied, but tomorrow Christie's is launching the first thematic collection, focused exclusively on Rolex watches that come with their original boxes and paperwork.
Right now you less-seasoned collectors are probably thinking, "Wait, why do I want to pay for a bunch of old brochures and packaging?"
Oh, how nostalgic I am for the days when all I cared about was the watch itself. The actual watch is still top priority, of course, but after that, the accouterments come into play. Many people threw packaging away and didn't keep the authenticity certificates, user manuals, and other trinkets that came with their watches, making them rare. It's also a good sign that everything is kosher with the watch when you have all the documents and accessories to back it up.
There are 23 watches in Christie's sale, though not all of them are truly vintage (not a bad thing, though they're less interesting and more common). It didn't take very long to browse through and find a few favorites. On the bread-and-butter end of the spectrum are a few Datejusts—in particular, examples with attractive black and grey dials. Datejusts are actually harder to find with box and papers, since they're more consumer-oriented watches and didn't have the same early collector followings as such watches as the Daytona and Submariner.
Those more collectible watches are represented as well. A stunning 18K yellow gold Day-Date "President" made my favorites cut and has the distinctive red box reserved for this model.
The top lot though is a ref. 6263 Daytona, often called a "Big Red" because of the large Daytona writing above the subdial at 6 o'clock. Sure, at just under $60,000, it won't come cheap, but this is the kind of watch that you often have to pounce on when one comes to market.
Prices range from $4,500 for a relatively basic Air-King to $58,000 for that awesome ref. 6263 Daytona, with GMT-Masters, Submariners, and less common Oyster Perpetuals sitting in the middle. This thematic sale begins on Tuesday, March 31, at 10 a.m. EST, and you can find it on the

=== Title: Six Things You Need for That Quick Cold-Weather Getaway - Bloomberg ===

If, like me, you live somewhere that's beginning to resemble the North Pole (though in New York the snow is much, much dirtier), nothing sounds better right now than hopping on a plane for a warm weekend away. Just typing that sentence has me tearing up. (Or is it the arctic wind?)
Now, a proper weekend jaunt requires careful packing—you want all the essentials and indulgences, with none of the bulk. And forget about checking a bag, that's for amateurs only. Here are the five things that will drastically increase your odds of relaxing the right way (and the bag to toss them into for good measure).
In this case, forget everything I said about 
. Still buy one, but leave it at home for your short trip. Olloclip recently updated its line of mobile photography lenses to include a few options for the iPhone 6 (the new shape took some crafty engineering to accommodate). Their most complicated model might sound tempting, but what you really want is the 
 ($99). This gives you some genuine zoom capability. and the polarizer will make sure the water in your beach selfies looks blue and inviting, instead of like a solar flare. The Olloclip fits in your pocket and costs less than a tray of those umbrella-laden Mai Tais you'll be throwing back. 
You want to get away now, not in June. The success of last-minute hotel-booking apps such as 
 has led Booking.com to release 
, a brand new iOS app that lets you lock down reservations on whatever timeline works for you. Already on the ground at your destination? No problem. Tell the app what area, price, and amenities you're looking for and it will search nearly 600,000 properties to find you a room. Now go buy that plane ticket and stop stressing out.
Save your packing space for clothes and shoes and stick to more modest-sized headphones. You might not want to jam the 
 ($180) into your jeans, but they can easily fit in a jacket pocket, and the updated design (hence "Series 2") is extremely comfortable. They're not noise-canceling, so you don't have any battery to worry about, but the snug fit goes a long way to block out external noise, and the sound quality is excellent. You don't have a vacation playlist yet? Seriously?
It's February, so no matter how warm your destination is, chilly nights and morning aren't out of the question. Plus, with hundreds of thousands of air miles under my belt, I have yet to spend time on a warm airplane. The 
 ($165) is exactly what it sounds like: a really lightweight jacket that's warm and water-resistant enough for that early walk on the beach (or even just the ride to and from the airport). And if you end up not needing it, the Ultralight can easily be squashed down tightly at the bottom of your bag without coming out worse for wear.
Face it: Even though you plan on being away from your desk and walls, you're not going to get a full day of battery life out of your phone—especially if you're using maps to find your way around unfamiliar territory. (Not to mention listening to music, catching up on Instapaper reading, or Instagramming pictures of your feet by the pool for the benefit of your work-bound friends.) The 
 ($39.95) goes between your phone and its wall charger, charging as soon as your phone is full. This means one less thing to remember to plug in, and if you're out of the country, you don't have to get a separate adaptor for your phone and your extra battery.
You're traveling light, not going to Coachella, so don't try to cram everything into a hiking backpack. Lotuff has been making incredible leather luggage in the U.S. for a while now, but an all bridle leather duffel bag is almost too heavy to carry when it's empty, let alone after it's packed. The 
 is much more practical, and the holdall ($825) is big enough for even a heavy packer like me to make it three or four days (especially if you're loading up shorts, not sweaters).

=== Title: Looted Matisse Hoarded by Gurlitt Returns to Rosenbergs - Bloomberg ===

 Henri Matisse’s “Femme Assise,” or “Seated Woman,” was handed over to the heirs of 20th century French art dealer Paul Rosenberg, ending an 18-month struggle to reclaim the painting.

=== Title: Record $2.7 Billion Auctions Ignite Buying at N.Y. Art Fairs - Bloomberg ===

 As spring auction sales wrapped up in New York at a record $2.7 billion last week, a slew of art fairs shared in the frenzied buying.
Works at 
 went for as much as $4 million while smaller fairs sold art pinned to the walls of booths for less than $3,000. Among the shoppers were seasoned collectors including Peter Kraus, chief executive officer of AllianceBernstein Corp., and real-estate developer Jerry Speyer.
“When you see the sensationalized prices, it’s good for the market,” Steven Hartman, owner of 
, which had a booth at the 
 fair, said about auctions. “Rising tides lift all boats. At every financial level in which collectors buy, they like to know the art market is doing well.”
The New York art fairs -- half a dozen over two weeks -- are among the largest such events. Unlike auctions, which offer previously-owned art, fairs primarily sell new work by artists and cater to a broader group of collectors, making them a better indicator of the strength of the overall market. Sales at fairs, the second largest revenue channel for dealers after galleries, rose 29 percent last year, driven by an increasing number of global rich.
The May auctions were “the 1 percent dealing with themselves,” said art dealer Nicole Klagsbrun, who sold a pair of glazed ceramic vessels by 
 for $20,000 at the 
 fair, which showcased emerging and mid-career artists.
Sales at art fairs accounted for 40 percent of all dealer sales in 2014 at 9.8 billion euros ($10.9 billion), up from 7.6 billion euros in the prior year, according to an 
 published in March by the European Fine Art Foundation.
Auctions are an outlier because a small number of transactions accounts for almost half of the market’s sales. Top works made up 48 percent of the value of the auction market in 2014 but only 0.5 percent of transactions, according to the foundation’s report.
“That’s another planet,” Arne Ehmann, an executive director at 
, said about auctions. “It’s a different market.”
A $179.4 million Pablo Picasso painting this spring became the most expense work sold at auction. Piet Mondrian’s 1929 composition fetched $50.6 million. Alberto Giacometti’s bronze sculpture of a pointing man was purchased for $141.3 million, an auction record for a sculpture.
Prices at art fairs, while rising, are still bargains by comparison. Thaddaeus Ropac sold a Joseph Beuys blackboard chalk drawing for 550,000 euros at its booth at Frieze and a Tony Cragg sculpture for 200,000 euros.
Contessa, based in Cleveland, sold a $40,000 life-size sculpture of a spray can with the Campbell’s soup label by the artist known as 
. The booth, with a number of works by the artist, was spraypainted in bright colors on its floors and walls.
At Frieze, 
 gallery sold a 1989 work by Cady Noland of a walker, basket, American flag and pole with wheel for $1.5 million. By comparison, Noland’s 1989 “Bluewald” screenprint on aluminum cutout fetched an artist record of $9.8 million at Christie’s on May 11.
 sold a 1949 Jean Dubuffet painting for about $2.5 million. On May 11 at Christie’s, Dubuffet’s densely colorful 1961 “Paris Polka” fetched $24.8 million, more than three times the artist’s previous auction record of $7.4 million set six months earlier. The seller was billionaire collector Steven A. Cohen, who runs family office Point72 Asset Management.
“Dubuffet is getting noticed again,” gallery co-owner Eleanor Acquavella said. “His market is just starting to head in the direction it should be going.”
McKee Gallery, a first-time Frieze New York exhibitor, sold several paintings by 
 priced at $1 million to $4 million.
Prices at every level are being driven by an increasing number of global rich who are putting their money into art as an investment and status symbol. The top 12 art fairs had 641,500 visitors in the first quarter of the year, up 6.8 percent from the same period in 2014, according to Skate’s, a New York-based art market researcher.
Buyers have become more geographically diverse, with a strong showing from Asia, Russia, Europe and the U.S. Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Phillips said collectors from as many as 40 countries bid at the evening sales.
Dealers aimed to appeal at various price levels. At NADA, framed $5,000 prints of blue fish in an edition of 25 created this year by Joan Jonas -- whose work is a big hit at the 
, were selling quickly, said Rita Sobreiro Souther, head of operations at 
 of San Francisco. Proceeds benefit the nonprofit institute.
Collectors including Kraus and Speyer turned up at NADA.
“They come here for something they’ve never seen or heard of,” said Augusto Arbizo, whose 
 gallery sold works ranging from $8,000 to $35,000. “Prices are low enough that you can go with your gut. Most artists don’t have big resumes.”
Young collectors including Internet millionaires who built their fortunes at a faster pace than the older generation are moving just as quickly to buy art, said Rachel Lehmann, co-owner of 
 gallery in New York.
“It’s not uncommon anymore to collect art,” Lehmann said.
The gallery’s booth at Frieze sold a first edition of Teresita Fernandez’s 2015 wall sculpture, “Ghost Vines (Yellow Gold),” for more than $500,000. Fernandez’s public installation “Fata Morgana” opens at Madison Square Park in Manhattan on June 1.
“Art is an asset class of its own and people are very much investing in art,” said Ryan Ross, owner of Arcature Fine Art gallery in Palm Beach, Florida.

=== Title: Best Gifts for Watch Lovers: 6 Perfect Stocking Stuffers - Bloomberg ===

So your friend/sibling/partner/annoying co-worker is a watch nerd, and you need a little something to give next week? Let's be honest, a 
 is probably a little pricey for most, but great horological gifts don't have to break the bank. Here are six picks that no watch collector worth his or her weight in balance springs would want to be without. 
There's no question in my mind: These are the best watch straps money can buy. They come in a ton of colors, bright and muted, and in smooth calf leather, textured calf leather, and exotic skins such as crocodile. My favorite is that smooth taupe leather strap in the middle, but if bright purple croc is more your speed, Hermès can oblige. You'll have to head into a store, though, and ask to buy one of these: They're not kept out on the sales floor, and they're not sold online at all. 
 
A pile of beautiful straps is useless if you can't get them on your watches. New York watch blog Worn & Wound has a great pair of tools that are heavy-duty and will match the quality of your timepieces. There's a double-sided tool with screw-on caps perfect for home or the office and a smaller key-chain version for when you need to swap a strap on the go (or so you don't lose the damn thing). 
 
Whether it's in the closet or a weekend bag, a nice watch needs a nice home. Hodinkee's shop has you covered, with a range of single watch pouches and multiwatch rolls for storing tickers when they're not on your wrist. The single pouches can easily fit in a jacket pocket for toting one watch around (the camo suede option is particularly cool), while the rolls are made in the U.S.A. out of sturdy canvas and can keep up to six watches protected at once. 
 
Most watch books are heavy on photos, light on storytelling, and meant to sit on the coffee table (some could actually 
). John Biggs's 2015 book, 
 on the other hand, makes a strong case for watches as objects of genuine historical interest, with some royal gossip, competitive innovation, and a crazy heist thrown in for good measure. Buy it for a watch nerd, then steal it back and read it yourself. 
 
Watches have had clear backs since the 1980s, letting wearers admire the tiny mechanisms inside. To really appreciate the little bevels and finishes (all applied by hand, of course), a little magnification goes a long way. The Loupe System is the gold standard of loupes, with camera-quality optics, a grippy rubber housing that won't scratch watches, and optional cases for attaching it to your smartphone for raking in those 
 likes. 
 
This little metal square lets you use your iPhone to monitor what's going on inside your mechanical watches. After 
, I found the insights into my watches extremely addictive—like that my favorite vintage watch is consistently inconsistent, deviating by precisely +4 seconds per day. It's something any collector would love but might not buy for him or herself—which is, in the end, the perfect kind of gift. 

=== Title: Forget Paris, London Is the New Hotspot for Swiss Watches: Chart - Bloomberg ===

The U.K. posted the biggest gain in Swiss watch exports last year as a weaker pound, more tourists and additional store space helped it catch up with France and Germany.

=== Title: Breitling Exospace B55 Hands-On: Video - Bloomberg ===

The age of the luxury smartwatch is upon us.
As recently as a year ago, high-end watchmakers were 
the just-announced Apple Watch, calling it ugly, a fad, and not very luxurious. But now we seem to be firmly in a period when mainstream Swiss companies are trying in earnest to find their digital footing. 
 is selling so well that the company 
 after just a few weeks. 
 lets users get smartwatch features without giving up traditional watches. And brands from Bvlgari to 
 have entered the fray with their own battery-powered products as well.
The new 
 is Breitling's first foray into the smartwatch market. 
The B55 looks enough like an analog watch to begin with—it sports the usual three hands, bezel markings, etc.—that is, until you spy the pair of embedded LCD screens. Breitling fans will recognize them from the dials of the brand's hybrid offerings, such as the Aerospace chronos, where they function as the displays for extra chronograph timers and alarm functions. Unlike prior watches, though, the Exospace B55 connects to your smartphone. 
Three basic categories of digital functions are at play here: 1) using your phone to manipulate the watch; 2) passing data from the watch to your phone; and 3) receiving data from your phone on the watch.
The first category is the simplest and most useful. Instead of fiddling with the crown, you can set the time, alarms, and display on the watch all from a Breitling app. The second type of functionality lets you use the watch's pushers to activate the chronograph as you normally would, only the data are then passed to an app so you can store, share, and track events over longer periods of time. Finally, those little screens can show you notifications for calendar appointments, text messages, and other info from your smartphone. They're too small to show you more than caller ID info or to let you know to check your inbox, but this is way better than Breitling trying to show full scrolling e-mails on those tiny panels.
The hardware itself is just what you'd expect from Breitling: a large 46 mm, pilot-style watch, rendered in all-black titanium, with a bright blue, thick rubber strap and sturdy, deployant-style buckle. The whole package is lighter than it looks, even if the 46 mm watch is still way too big for most people (forget trying to wear it with a sportcoat or a sweater).
The watch charges through a proprietary USB cable that connects to the side with a magnet. A single charge will get you one to two months of use, depending on how much you're using the backlight (the single biggest drain on the battery).
The connected technology is new, but the movement at the core of the Exospace B55 is one of Breitling's hyper-accurate SuperQuartz movements. These are electronic movements fine-tuned to compensate for such things as temperature and pressure to keep them accurate. Breitling is one of only a handful of brands making this kind of timekeeper, and building off it in this way seems quite logical. There wasn't a single moment using the B55 when I felt like it was a gimmick.
In the half hour or so I had to play with the B55, the experience overall was pretty positive. I expected poorly designed software and a clumsy user experience but didn't encounter either. The watch automatically saves all your data and pushes them to the app the next time you connect the two, so no need to make sure you're using them in tandem at all times. The watch is perfectly functional all on its own; the app just makes using it easier. 
The Exospace B55 is priced at $8,900, clearly signaling that this is meant to be an alternative to another luxury Swiss chronograph, not a
. The watch is 
 now, and while it seems to be a sound concept, only time will tell whether this is the luxury Swiss smartwatch customers have been waiting for or whether we've got just another curiosity.

=== Title: The A. Lange & Söhne Datograph Perpetual (Somehow) Just Got Even Better - Bloomberg ===

While everybody is oooing and ahhhing over the most surprising new releases at 
, one of the luxury watch industry's most important tradeshows, it's an update on an old favorite that has me giddy.
The Datograph Perpetual is an absolute powerhouse of a watch, combining the best of 
's manufacturing and design in one package. The changes aren't anything radical, but by refining the things that made the original so desirable and getting rid of everything unnecessary, Lange has made this new edition the handsomest yet. 
It's been three years since Lange replaced the basic Datograph with the Datograph Up/Down, flattening out the case a bit, adding that little power reserve indicator, and removing the confusing Roman numerals from the dial. The Datograph Perpetual has had both the larger 41mm case and the power reserve indicator since it was first introduced in 2006, but it was still saddled with those unfortunate Roman numerals. In the new version, they're replaced by straight batons all around and the bezel shape has changed just enough to make the overall profile feel more refined.
The new Datograph Perpetual has an 18k white gold case with a dark gray dial made of silver. The subregisters for the perpetual calendar and chronograph functions are a lighter silver that matches nicely with the hands and markers. The lack of Roman numerals means more gray shows through, which, while it might not sound all that drastic, gives the dial a much roomier feel. Until now, only the rose gold version with a white dial was available without Roman numerals. It's the little things in watches that make all the difference.
There's no argument for this being an everyman's watch. It's totally insane. But if you're looking for something that combines true complication, top-tier movement finishing (the caliber L952.1 is a work of art), and modern styling, this will certainly tick all those boxes. Most highly complicated watches feel as if they're begging to be paired with a bespoke pinstripe suit and a well-worn Chesterfield. A Rick Owens leather jacket and Vitra sofa are a better fit here.
My only real complaint about the new Datograph Perpetual is the 
 to André Gide in its press release, somehow needed by this German luxury watch brand to justify its color choices. Someone obviously skipped that assignment at university, but we won't hold it against them. It doesn't make the watch itself any less impressive. 

=== Title: The BMW i3 Is a Peppy, Efficient Pain in the Back - Bloomberg ===

Here’s the difference between an optimist and a pessimist.
An optimist drives the BMW i3 electric car and marvels at how great it is that he has only to lift his foot off the accelerator for the car to stop. The moment the foot releases pressure, the regenerative braking system will make actual braking—placing your foot on the pedal and pressing down—unnecessary. The car slows dramatically on its own.
A pessimist drives the BMW i3 electric car and finds himself annoyed that those blasted regenerative brakes make it feel like you're stutter-stepping through every stoplight.
I tended toward the latter. It could be a character defect. I’m OK with that.
Immediate deceleration is not the defining characteristic of the car—the oblong body, 117-mpg efficiency, and variety of interior materials are all good candidates for that—but the sensation certainly commands your attention. And it gets more wearisome over time.
This was part of the main problem for me with the i3—it might well be fun to drive for just an hour or two on a warm, sunny day. It’s quiet as it runs, with plucky bursts of speed effective for jumping through traffic, even if it does take more than seven seconds to hit 60 mph. And with its excellent rearview camera, alert proximity sensors, and a body 19 inches shorter than a Porsche 911, you can parallel park it with your eyes closed. (But don’t.)
But I drove the four-door plug-in for many hours on multiple days through Manhattan traffic and Red Hook cobblestones. Its smooth acceleration and near-silent motor/engine combo helped make the seat-time endurable, but after four, five, six hours in the car, the muscles in my back felt like ground chuck. The flat cloth seats have almost no padding to save you from road fatigue—although I did use their heating function a lot.
And there, again, is a conundrum: See, the seat heaters don’t work when the i3 is in Eco-Plus mode, the most efficient of its three drive modes. They do work with its other two settings—Comfort and Eco—but if you use those, you reduce the effectiveness of the battery charge, which is supposed to let you travel 70-plus miles at its most efficient. Over a long week of driving (and short luck finding functioning charging stations in the city), anything that diminished my driving range made me nervous.
The prospect of twiddling your thumbs for four hours to wait for a full charge would scare any New Yorker, myself included. I opted for tenderized deltoids.
BMW launched the i3 last year as part of its electric range of cars. (They’re the ones with “i” in the name—i stands for “innovation.”) The $140,000 i8 supercar 
 that looks like a spaceship. The $45,200 i3 is the sidekick. Compare it against the Nissan Leaf, the Smart Fortwo, or the upcoming hybrid Mini. Do not compare it to, say, a Tesla S, even though both use electric technology. The Model S is a proper luxury sedan. It’s faster, more powerful, more expensive, and much better-looking.
This one is better used to augment a garage already well-stocked with conventional models. It’s a Sunday drive-rather-than-weekend road trip proposition.
The version I drove paired a 170-hp motor and range-extending two-cylinder rear-wheel-drive engine. They averaged 117 mpg and roughly 140 miles on a full charge and full tank of gas. (That soundly beats the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, which gets only 11 miles in electric-only mode and 50-mpg combined efficiency; it also beats the Chevrolet Volt and Cadillac ELR.) It takes about 20 hours to charge unless you buy the quick-charge system BMW also sells, which fills it in fewer than four.
I was happy to find that the i3 comes with all of the conveniences of BMW’s intuitive iDrive system. It also has as standard auto-dimming mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, automatic climate and cruise control, and advanced safety systems. You can choose to spend more money on alloy wheels, rearview cameras, keyless entry, Harman\Kardon sound, and those aforementioned heated seats if you want.
The interior of the carbon-fiber “passenger shell” is spacious, with a clear pass-through at the feet of the front seats and enough headroom to accommodate four tall adults. It also positions the driver and passengers well for a decent view of the road: The high seats put you eye-level with people in sedans and crossovers that far outsize the i3, so there’s no awkward ingress for larger men or ladies in skirts.
I also liked its wide dashboard, streamlined instrument clusters, and generous allotment of ambient lighting. Along with the faux wood and wool cloth trim, they made the interior of the i3 feel serene. Sitting motionless inside the i3 has a calming effect.
The exterior of the car evokes far less serenity.
I suppose some Silicon Valley first-adopters and Prius enthusiasts looking to upgrade may appreciate the i3’s shrunken grille, plain sides, and boxy rear end; they may celebrate the waved wraparound of its rear windows. But I found myself wondering why the i3 couldn’t look more like the i8—or at the very least less like a futuristic shopping cart.
Maybe the guy who knocked on the window earlier today as I sat parked on Madison Avenue was closer to the majority in this regard.
He asked if I liked it. I told him, “It’s OK,” then said, “Do you like it?”
He gave it a once-over and scratched his head: “I’ve been a BMW guy for 40 years—I’m just not sure.”

=== Title: Super Lightweight Supercars Dominate at Geneva Motor Show - Bloomberg ===

 is Swedish for "crazy." 
OK, really it's the maker of an especially exotic line of hyperfast track cars. But it feels like there should be a blanket Scandanavian term for many of the new cars this week at the Geneva Motor Show. All austerity measures seem to be called off. Consider this the year of the supercar.
For example, Aston Martin showed its 800-horsepower, 
. Mercedes showed a AMG GT3 race car with a 600hp V8 engine that screamed like a banshee as it rolled on stage to wild applause during its debut; Ferrari unveiled the turbocharged and (relatively) efficient 
; Lamborghini showed an extended version of its Aventador called the LP 750-4 Superveloce (Aventador SV for short). As if the Aventador wasn’t aggressive enough.  
On the more driveable end of the spectrum, Bentley surprised the world with its beautiful 
coupe. It’s sexier—more svelte—than its beefier Continental cousins, thanks in part to a redesigned front grill and leaner sculpting throughout its body. Inside, it has quilted bucket seats and a softer, continuous design line around the cabin. At a private dinner with McLaren last night, it was the main topic of conversation among the European press who attended. (McLaren unveiled an aggressive whip of its own, the 
.)
Audi 
 line with a $250,000-plus electric variant; Porsche gave us a 911 GT3 RS. Koenigsegg showed two stunners: the 
 and the multimillion-dollar Agera RS. 
But while the dozen or so new luxury sports cars that arrived yesterday would make James Bond himself salivate, they differed from the supercars we’ve seen in previous years. This year automakers seem to have struck a healthy balance between attaining increasingly stupendous new levels of power—a race that was unsustainable anyway—and bolstering lightweight efficiency. 
It’s not enough anymore that your car of choice gets 600-plus horsepower. Now it must also learn how to subsist on fuel as lightly as a hummingbird sips nectar. 
“The car must be up to the task of delivering blistering, lightweight performance at new levels of soothing luxury,” Christian von Koenigsegg said in a press statement about the Regera. “Get the luxury but keep the weight down.”
Ditto everyone. 
Amedeo Felisa at Ferrari, Andy Palmer at Aston Martin, and Daimler’s Dieter Zetsche, among others, all spent portions of their opening speeches bragging about the records set by their new products in power-to-weight ratios. 
“The Vulcan is the most extreme Aston Martin we’ve ever made,” said Palmer, who pointed out that at 2,976 pounds, the all-carbon-fiber coupe weighs fully 300 pounds less than the famous One-77. “It sets a whole new standard in the ultrahigh luxury supercar class.”
Others, such as Mike Flewitt at McLaren, reiterated promises to diversify powertrains in favor of alternative fuels. In 10 years, more than half of McLaren’s cars use hybrid energy, he said. And Zetsche committed Mercedes to offering 10 different plug-in hybrids by 2017. 
Not that it changes anyone’s appetite for speed. 
“The new GT3 is packed with potential to keep our customers ahead of the competition, with less weight, faster lap times, and more aggressive looks than its predecessor,” Zetsche told reporters. “And we are hungry for more.” 
These days, apparently, weight loss and whopping power aren’t mutually exclusive. Let’s hope the partnership lasts.  
 

=== Title: Patek Philippe Watchmaking School New York - Bloomberg ===

If you've been thinking about become a watchmaker, now might be your chance: Patek Philippe is opening the Patek Philippe Horology Programme New York, a free, two-year watchmaking course to train the next generation of specialized watchmakers. 
This is the second Patek Philippe training program outside the company's Geneva headquarters, the first having opened in Shanghai in 2013. The first six apprentices in the New York program began their two-year course of study a few weeks ago. Because the program was not publicized, Patek used a headhunter to find people looking for technical jobs and invited them to apply. Of 300 applicants, the top 80 were brought to Patek's New York workshop for presentations from executives and the technical teams. The final six were chosen according to their reactions during the visit and the level of interest and curiosity they showed.
The selected students pay no tuition, are given a stipend to help cover rent and food, and are guaranteed a job with Patek Philippe upon graduation. Sweet deal. The idea is to encourage smart young people to look at watchmaking as a viable career path while removing some of the financial barriers to entry.
The program teaches students to work on quartz, mechanical, and automatic watches, including those with basic complications such as date displays. (Perpetual calendars, split-seconds chronographs, and the like come much, much later). Laurent Junod, a watchmaker who has been with Patek Philippe for 27 years, has been appointed director of technical training and will oversee the program.
"Anyone in this industry understand how difficult it is to find high-level watchmakers," said Larry Pettinelli, President of Patek Philippe USA. "As the interest in mechanical timepieces has grown steadily over the past 20 years, we are determined to be able to provide the best possible service to clients worldwide, now and in the future." 
The New York service center is an important part of this challenge. Approximately 10,000 watches come through the workshop each year, according to the brand, and 19 watchmakers are currently handling all those repairs. Some require only such simple things as a little lubrication or some polishing, while others require complex mechanical work. Without trained, highly specialized watchmakers, the whole operation screeches to a halt—and when you've got a $100,000 watch, the last thing you want is to wait six months for it to travel to Geneva and back for a tune-up.
Most watchmaking schools, especially those outside Switzerland, are sponsored or managed by a specific brand or conglomerate of brands. Without skilled labor, there's no way to make new watches or to fulfill the promise of indefinite service that comes with buying one. Rolex has the 
 in Liditz, Pa.; Richemont draws watchmakers from the

=== Title: Rolex Oysterflex Bracelet Reimagines the Rubber Strap - Bloomberg ===

Rolex doesn’t do anything halfway. When the curtains went up at Baselworld 2015, 
 to see a strange rubber strap on 
 sitting in the Rolex booth window. Precious-metal sport watches are nothing new for Rolex, but a rubber strap seems almost too cool and under the radar for the brand.
We should have known it was no ordinary rubber strap, though. It’s the new Oysterflex bracelet, and it deserves a closer look.
Most rubber straps are about as simple an affair as a watch strap can be: two pieces of injection-molded rubber, one with holes and the other with a buckle at the end. They’re flexible, they don’t get smelly or absorb sweat, and they lend some fake deep-sea diving credibility to those of us who spend most of our watch-wearing days above the surface. There’s really little need to innovate or add anything here, but of course Rolex found ways to make this basic accessory even better.
Every Rolex employee I’ve spoken with (along with the pile of marketing material out there) is careful to refer to the Oysterflex as a bracelet and not a strap. Typically, metal links qualify as a bracelet, while a leather, rubber, or fabric band would be called a strap. The Oysterflex is not an injection-molded rubber strap, but instead a two-piece titanium bracelet with a rubber coating.
Yes, that’s both as prosaic and as complicated as it sounds.
The foundation of the Oysterflex is a pair of titanium blades, one on each side of the watch. These are coated in black elastomer (a substance similar to what you’ll find on the Apple Watch) and anchored to the Yacht-Master’s case. Underneath each half is a patented longitudinal cushion system, which is basically a collection of strange rubber flaps with a funny name. They’re supposed to “stabilize” the watch, but more on that later. The solid Everose gold Oysterlock clasp holding the two pieces together seems like overkill, but anything else in this context might feel like a letdown.
On the wrist the Oysterflex does have the same rigidity that you’d expect from a metal bracelet but without that cold, silky feeling when you first put it on. I don’t know if I feel like those pads stabilize the watch (whatever that means), but they do allow some air to circulate between the rubber and your skin. A few hours into a hot day this will become your favorite feature, I promise. I thought I’d find the gold clasp annoying and heavy, but it actually balances out the watch nicely, making the whole package feel more complete.
There are no two ways about it: The Oysterflex bracelet is one of the most overengineered, overly complicated, and probably unnecessary watch accessories ever. But that’s kind of why it’s so awesome. Someone at Rolex HQ decided a rubber strap might be an interesting idea to think about, and then followed that out to its logical conclusion, giving us a titanium and rubber hybrid that has a patented cushioning system and a solid gold clasp.
That’s a kind of thinking I can get behind.

=== Title: Apple Helps Push U.S. Watch Sales to Biggest Drop in Seven Years - Bloomberg ===

 U.S. watch sales fell the most in seven years in June, one of the first signs Apple Inc.’s watch is eroding demand for traditional timepieces.
Retailers sold $375 million of watches during the month, 11 percent less than in June 2014, according to data from NPD Group. The 14 percent decline in unit sales was the largest since 2008, according to Fred Levin, head of the market researcher’s luxury division.
“The Apple Watch is going to gain a significant amount of penetration,” he said Thursday in a phone interview. “The first couple of years will be difficult for watches in fashion categories.”
The market for watches that cost less than $1,000 is most at risk, as consumers in that price range have indicated they’re the most likely to buy an Apple Watch, Levin said. Sales of watches costing between $50 and $999 registered drops in June, the biggest being a 24 percent decline in timepieces from $100 to $149.99, according to NPD’s data.
The Apple Watch isn’t the only cause of the downturn. Lower-priced fashion brands suffered as retailers and department stores offered more discounts due to those products’ “saturation” with consumers, Levin said. That category includes brands such as Timex, Guess, Burberry and Tissot.
“In the short term, brands at accessible price points are going to have to think very seriously,” he said.
Most U.S. watch sales data is limited to exports of Swiss watches to that market, which don’t measure sales to consumers. Those shipments rose every month except May in the first half of 2015, according to Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry data available on Bloomberg Intelligence. The first half increase was 4.2 percent.
Apple Inc.’s refusal to say how many smartwatches it has sold has investors and analysts relying on guesswork to estimate sales. Harder yet is gauging the impact on the $50 billion Swiss watch market. Elmar Mock, one of the inventors of the Swatch, said in March that Apple may cause an “ice age” for the four-century-old industry. The computer maker has already shaken up the music market with its iTunes software, while its iPhone supplanted Nokia Oyj’s dominance.
Apple introduced three models of its smartwatch in April, with prices ranging from $349 for the most basic version to $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model. The company said June 22 revenue in the unit containing its timepiece rose by about $950 million in the three months through June compared with the first three months of the year.
That would suggest the company may have sold at least 1.9 million watches, assuming the Apple Watch had an average selling price of $499. NPD estimates the traditional watch industry sold 927,500 timepieces in June in the U.S.
Producers such as Swatch Group AG, the maker of Omega, have maintained that Apple’s entry isn’t a threat and will spur sales of traditional timepieces in the long term by getting young people in the habit of wearing a watch.
NPD’s U.S. watch data estimates sales of about 70 brands from Timex to Harry Winston through department stores, national chains and independent jewelers. It doesn’t include boutiques owned by watch brands, supermarket chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. NPD’s luxury tracker was formerly known as LGI Network.

=== Title: Five Best Gem-Set Women’s Watches at SIHH 2016 - Bloomberg ===

It can often feel like women are an afterthought when it comes to mechanical watches. It's as if slapping a few diamonds on a miniaturized version of a men's watch, throwing an inexpensive quartz movement inside, and launching a marketing campaign were actually enough to persuade a thinking person to invest in something. Thankfully, times are changing, as seen at this year's 
. Brands are thinking outside the box and creating lots of great women's watches that rival their creations for men in every way. Here are a few of the best.
Gem setting is nothing new for 
, but mounting 66 tourmalines in a monobloc carbon case is definitely out of the ordinary. In fact, the manufacture had to invent (and patent) a new technique for setting the stones in the rigid material. Against the mottled black, the bluish-green stones really shine. Underneath all this, though, is a Geneva Seal-certified movement made entirely in house by Roger Dubuis. Only 88 pieces of this watch will be made, and each will cost 55,000 Swiss francs (approximately $55,000). 
 
got an overhaul this year, and this watch is one of the standouts. The case has a slightly more architectural feel, with some visual tension in the lugs and along the sides. Slim diamond lines at the top and bottom of the dial provide a little sparkle without being too distracting. A face is on each side of the reversible case (two for the price of one at $11,500), but the back dial is the one you'll be staring at. The double line markers and moonphase indicator stand out nicely against the deep textured blue, and the sharp hands are easy to read, even on the small scale.
 
When it comes to making metal watch bracelets, Piaget's know-how is second to none. It has an entire Geneva workshop with dozens of dedicated designers and artisans who do nothing else. This extension of 
 takes the asymmetrical case shape with a slim diamond bezel and renders it with an integrated full mesh bracelet in either rose gold ($34,500) or white gold ($36,000). They're so flexible and comfortable they feel almost like a thin leather or satin strap once you put them on, and because of the fully adjustable sliding clasp, you don't have to get it personally sized by a jeweler, either. It’s convenience and elegance all in one.
 
I know I said shrinking down a men's watch and putting diamonds on it was a bad idea, but consider this Vacheron Constantin as the thoughtful exception that proves the rule. The ladies' version of the new Overseas has 
 but with a full diamond-set bezel and a unique brownish-gray dial that is even more distinctive than the blue and gray options available on the other versions. While my favorite is the rose gold watch on a soft white rubber strap ($39,500), there are also variations with full metal bracelets in both stainless steel ($24,900) and rose gold ($51,400).
 
; it's an entirely new collection from Cartier. The basic profile shared by all the watches is a series of nested ovals that are layered vertically, so the shape of the case appears to shift as you tilt the watch and look from different angles. On some watches, additional layers of diamonds and black lacquer amplify the illusion. There are many different models, ranging from a pink gold model on a strap with no lacquer and only two rings of diamonds ($28,600) to a full diamond pavé model on a diamond pavé bracelet ($181,000). This is Cartier at its best.

Greubel Forsey, the Swiss watchmaker that produces about 100 timepieces a year, reduced its entry-level price by half in an attempt to attract more customers as the industry faces the first annual exports decline since 2009.

=== Title: Five Border-Pushing Travel Watches for the World Tourist - Bloomberg ===

The 
 made its debut in the 1950s. While it wasn't the first travel-focused watch, it definitely set the standard and cemented the connection between timepieces and globetrotting. It showed two time zones at once, didn't require any mechanical resetting, and was extremely easy to read. But things have come a long way since the '50s, so while the GMT is classic, there's a new group of travel watches pushing the genre even farther. Here are five top choices for your Memorial Day weekend getaway (even if it's just to that bar down the block).
The 
 is a dressed-up travel watch that can display both your home time and local time in any of 37 time zones. I bet you can't even name all 37 time zones. City codes pop up in the daylight savings time and standard time windows around 8 o'clock, with the special half-hour and quarter-hour zones shown in blue and red. Setting is easy: You just rotate the crown by the windows. And unlike many watches in the genre, the Senator Cosmopolite can go forward and backward without harming the mechanism. 
The 
 is about as minimal a travel watch as you're going to find. The long, slim hands and subtle dot markers are the same as what you'll find on the more reserved time-only Koppel, but there are two important additions to the dial. At 12 o'clock is the graphic power reserve indicator (bigger dot, more power) and the 24-hour dial down at 6 o'clock. You just set it to another time zone and it acts like an out-of-the-way GMT hand without requiring that you clutter things up with a fourth central hand. 
While it uses the familiar GMT format pioneered by the Rolex GMT (a central hand that makes one rotation every 24 hours to track the second time zone), the proprietary 
 movement keeps things interesting. Essentially Spring Drive uses a wound spring as a power source, just like any other mechanical watch, but then regulates the motion of the hands with an electronic regulator. Think of it as a middle ground between a mechanical and a quartz watch. Only 200 pieces will be made with the limited edition green dial, which you could easily stare at for hours. 
The 
 (DTE for short) is all about symmetry. There are two tourbillons and two time zones, each logically placed across from the other. The top dial with Roman numerals can track the time back home, while the Arabic numerals (better for days off) make sure you keep your dinner reservation. The pair of clear dials is useful, and the pair of tourbillons entertaining (if excessive). I wouldn't expect anything else from Arnold & Son. 
Confusing name, great watch. The 
 is a full world-timer that lets you see the time concurrently in 24 time zones. You also get a nifty map of the northern hemisphere (sorry, friends Down Under) that changes from light to dark as the sun rises and sets across the continents. It was one of my 
 this year and four months later, I'm still wishing for one on my wrist. 

=== Title: Building an Arsenal of Smartwatch Smarts - Bloomberg ===

Ever since smartwatches started hitting the market, Swatch Group Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek has downplayed their importance, dismissing even Apple’s offering as “not a milestone” and saying the devices pose no threat. But he’s not taking any chances.

=== Title: Montblanc’s CEO Finds a Foothold in the Smartwatch Fray - Bloomberg ===

Watches might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Montblanc, but its chief executive officer, Jérôme Lambert, is working to change that. Since his arrival in 2013, the brand has been strategically pumping up its watch division right alongside the luxury pens and leather goods on which it made its name. And now Lambert's taking on smartwatches, too.
The 
 is a secondary device worn on a watch's strap to add such functions as calendar alerts and e-mail notifications without interfering with the mechanical watch above. It will be hitting stores in Europe in late August and will arrive in the U.S. by early October. It's worth noting that, for now, Montblanc will not be making the e-Strap available as a standalone device. You'll have to purchase it bundled with one of three Montblanc watches, with all-in prices ranging from $3,140 to $4,900. 
Montblanc's managing director of watches, Alexander Schmiedt, 
 that he believes the company's combination of contemporary technology and a traditional mechanical watch presents
 than a totally disposable smartwatch. Plus, it offers a way for watch lovers to enjoy wearables, too.
"Compared to the one-watch solution, the difference is I don't wear it as the main device. It's an additional device, an accessory to the watch," Lambert said in an interview on Bloomberg's Market Day. Software updates will be coming quarterly from Montblanc, and the company plans to support the first e-Strap for at least two years.
Having guided both A. Lange & Söhne and Jaeger-LeCoultre before joining Montblanc, Lambert brings a lot of watchmaking expertise to the C-suite. Combine this with the brand's Villeret, Switzerland, workshop and its ownership of the historic Minerva movement maker, and you get a sense of how Montblanc has spun up a truly high-end operation. In small numbers, it's making such insane creations as the 
 that sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars, drawing in the high-end collectors. At the same time, though, Montblanc's scale allows the creation of budget-friendly complications such as the 
, which, at $5,800, is a fraction of the price of most worldtime watches.
For Lambert, everything ultimately comes back to acknowledging technology while not throwing the traditions of mechanical watchmaking aside.
"Our tradition is coming from high watchmaking; it doesn't come from the technology world. This is why we went for a solution that is an add-on to the traditional technology," he said. 

=== Title: The 10 Best Watches From Baselworld 2015 - Bloomberg ===

There's one day left in Baselworld 2015, but I'm back in New York, I've finally gotten the smell of schnitzel out of my favorite scarf, and I've had some time to look back over my notes and photos from a full week of nonstop watch-gazing. Here are the 10 watches I'm still thinking about after the show.
This watch really brings it. Longines packed an automatic monopusher chronograph into a streamlined 40 millimeter steel case and then added a 1920s-style dial with a bright red pulsometer scale (used by doctors to take a patient's pulse). That doesn't even take into account all the little technical flourishes in the movement, such as the column wheel that ensures crisp and accurate measurements. This is one of the first watches I saw last week, and I'm still wishing it were on my wrist. 
Because of its longtime status as a top-tier jewelry house, Chopard is one of the more underrated watch brands. The L.U.C line can compete with the likes of Patek and Vacheron, though it has its own, slightly less-traditional vibe. This rose gold "regulator" watch (one on which hours and minutes are tracked on separate axes) also has a second time zone and an nine-day power reserve. Did I mention it's chronometer-certified? Yeah, it's that, too. The time for classifying Chopard as a "jewelry watch" brand is long over, and this watch is further proof. 
Maps on dials can be a controversial subject. Fans of mid-century enamel worldtimers will talk to you about craftsmanship and tradition and whatever, but most of the time I think they just look tacky. This new version of Laurent Ferrier's dual-time Traveller watch (that window at 9 o'clock shows the hours of your second time zone), has a two-tone map that's a silver dome covered in black enamel that's worn away to reveal the continents. The hour markers hang out over the curvature of the dome. While it's so pretty on the front that you might forget to turn the watch over, that would be a mistake: Ferrier's micro-rotor movement could be the most beautiful automatic caliber ever made. 
Following up on its popular Dark and Grey Side of the Moon watches, this week Omega released a series of four new variations. There's one with a gold bezel, one that's totally blacked out, a third that's matte-finished, and one with some faux-vintage patina. The last stole the show for me. It's the big black watch for the guy who hates big black watches. The aged leather strap looks as if it came off an old motorcycle seat, and the creamy markers break up the black just enough. Now I just have to get cool enough to wear it. 
This is the one Patek-lovers have been waiting for. It's your basic, no-frills, time-only Nautilus in the classic "Jumbo" size (confusingly, Jumbo indicates that it's smaller than most of the other models), but this one comes in solid rose gold. That includes the bracelet, but the thin links make it feel much lighter than most other all-gold watches. The brown dial shifts in the light, begging you to show it off—which may not the best idea, depending on where you are. No one will mistake this for anything but what it is. 
Germany earned its watchmaking stripes by making crazily accurate chronometers in the 19th century for merchant ships and scientific use. This watch takes that tradition and reinterprets it in a way that's thoroughly modern. The angular hands and scrolling numerals are all rendered in bright SuperLuminova for reading in the dark, and the panoramic date at 6 o'clock is carefully matched to the dark dial for a more discreet look. The movement has traditional German finishing, but if you're not careful, you'll be too busy looking at the awesome dial to notice. 
Rarely do you see something entirely new at Baselworld. (Like never-seen-anything-even-close-to-similar-ever new.) This is just that. Finnish watchmaker Stepan Sarpaneva joined with a Swedish specialist in luminous materials to create the Northern Lights. It lives up to its name and glows so brightly when the lights go out that its almost startling. Sarpaneva says you can leave it on your bedside table when you go to sleep, and it will still be visible in the morning. I'd love to try for myself, but he's making only eight of these in each of three colors: blue, purple, and green. €
Perpetual calendars customarily involve a pile of windows and subdials pointing out four or five different measurements of time. The dials end up busy and crowded. Moser's perpetual skips the day-of-the-week indicator and uses a tiny arrow to count out the months, using the hour markers. He also puts the leap-year indicator on the movement (on the reverse), instead of the dial. This lets you fully appreciate the blue fumé dial (
), complemented by the distressed brown strap. This is high-end watchmaking without the pretension. 
The big TAG Heuer news from Basel was the forthcoming 
, but the company haven't stopped working on the mechanical front. The new Caliber 18 Carrera looks almost exactly like the original model from 1963. If you're not an expert, it would actually be easy to mistake one for the other in photos—the Caliber 18 is 39mm, while the first Carrera was 36mm—a dead giveaway in person. The domed sapphire crystal, faded grey markers, and sharply angled lugs (not to mention that old-school Heuer logo, sans TAG) are all spot-on. I had a hard time handing the sample back. 
These might be the best watches to come out of Baselworld 2015. There, I said it. The new Slim d'Hermès collection contains a few models, but the two starts are a time-only automatic and a dual-time perpetual calendar. Both are powered by thin automatic movements (wound by a micro-rotor) that are made in-house by Hermès. Everything, from the case shape to the numerals to the dial layouts, feels well-thought-out and complementary. Rarely do brands get it this right. 

=== Title: Four Incredible Vintage Chronographs to Kick Off Your Collection - Bloomberg ===

Is 2016 the year you finally become a 
 collector?  No time like the present to begin this beautiful addiction. (And if you play your cards right and forward this article to a time-pressed, procrastinating loved one, perhaps these could, uh, be your present, too.)
To kick off your habit, here are four incredible chronographs from the 1960s and '70s that caught my eye. No two are alike, the creds are solid, and you’ll be owning a piece of history as much as a wrist-borne fashion statement. 
 
I've never met a watch collector who doesn't like the Omega Speedmaster. It took man to the moon and back, even if it was originally designed for racecar drivers. 
 saw a few Speedies fetch six-figure prices, but 
 sits at a much more reasonable $3,550. Notice that year means it dates to before the moon landing, back when this was a humble, little-known chrono.
 
Let's forgive the Viceroy Autavia for originally being used as a promotional item to sell cigarettes—it's a legit racing chronograph whose merits let it transcend its sktechy past. 
 is in crispy mint condition, with the bezel and dial still inky black, the seconds hand and accents bright red, and the beads-of-rice-style bracelet still tight and shiny. This is a whole lot of watch for $3,750.
 
Love it? Hate it? Wait overnight in line to see the new 
 You'll know immediately if this watch is the right addition for your collection, and if it is, oh boy, it is. This 
 houses the legendary El Primero chronograph movement inside a funky case with a bright red sunburst dial and wide-link bracelet. Disco fever anyone?
 
The gold standard. There's no chronograph better known or more well-respected than the Rolex Daytona. 
 has the big red signature at 6 o'clock, a lightly faded dial, and a glossy black bezel. Sure, at $40,000, this is by far the most expensive watch of the bunch, but we're talking serious heirloom-quality wristwear here.

=== Title: A Less Flashy Vintage Rolex You Can Wear With Anything - Bloomberg ===

It's the start of a new year. Everyone's resolving to slim down, get things together, be better in 2016. The Rolex Explorer is a handsome vintage watch to go along with your restraint. And it will definitely outlast those resolutions—sorry.
The Explorer has pretty lofty origins. In 1952, a few prototype watches were made for Edmund Hillary's historic first ascent of Mt. Everest. The 
, which has a white dial, triangular markers, and alpha-style hand, is sitting in the museum of a watch store in Zurich. It doesn't look like the one here because a year after the Hillary watch was made, Rolex reconfigured the aesthetics. In 1953, it issued the first watches with "Explorer" on the dial.
A few models of Explorer were made in the 1950s, but it was in 1963 that the ref. 1016 came out. This is, without a doubt, the most iconic Explorer watch. It's the one most collectors look for. (And it's the most direct predecessor to 
.) Unlike other vintage Rolex sport watches, the Explorer doesn't have a colored metal bezel that can fade and change over time, giving it a cleaner (if slightly less charming) look. At 36 millimeters, it's also smaller than something like the 
 or 
 , making it a little more versatile. On a leather or crocodile strap, it can easily do double-duty as a dress watch.
The Explorer's style of case also differs from other Rolex sport watches. Instead of the thick lugs with curved bevels along the edges, the 1016 has a case with softer swooping lugs. They should be polished on the sides and evenly brushed on top, with the holds sitting right in the middle and not too close to the edges. If they're off to one side or too near the edge, you know the case has been overly polished. This example is near-perfect, a great example of what this watch should look like.
The dial, too, is great on this example. The luminous stick markers, triangle, and 3-6-9, are all even and original, with a soft creamy hue. The hands are also original, although they have faded to a shade darker and slightly yellower than the markers. The contrast is nice looking, though some collectors prefer everything to look perfectly even. The movement inside this 1980s Explorer has hacking seconds, meaning that the seconds hand stops moving when you pull out the crown to set the time. This lets you set the watch more accurately.
As a bonus, this watch comes with the box and paperwork it originally sold with. This might not make the watch more fun to wear, but these little accoutrements add collector value, and they're certainly nice to have. Over the long term, they should improve the watch's value.

=== Title: The Baselworld Expo Will Reveal How Traditional Watchmakers Will Contend With the Apple Watch - Bloomberg ===

Basel, Switzerland is a small town that straddles the Rhine and sits right near both the French and German borders. It's best known for pharmaceutical giants and its eponymous art fair that travels to Miami and Hong Kong, but every spring for the last 98 years, Basel has also been taken over by the watch and jewelry industries, which gather to show off their latest wares. Welcome to Baselworld.
Swiss baubles and timepieces have been hocked in Basel since 1917, though it was as part of a larger show of industry until 1973. At that time, new quartz watches from Japan had traditional mechanical watchmakers on their heels; in a play for prestige, the brands showing in Basel developed their own expo. Eventually Swiss makers and their foreign counterparts made peace, and in 1986 the Basel show (called Baselworld since 2003) welcomed non-Swiss brands for the first time.
The newest exhibition hall—designed by local all-star architects Herzog and de Meuron—opened in 2013 and now offers more than 1.5 million square feet of exhibition space. It's filled this year by more than 1,500 brands from more than 40 countries, a far cry from the small fairs that were seen in the mid twentieth century.
The ornate three-story booths that clutter the hall are built by brands like Patek Philippe and Rolex, with their marble floors and on-demand espresso. They get all the attention, but in addition to makers of high-end luxury watches there are vendors selling loud CNC machines, cheap plastic bracelet links, and every other little bit of the supply chain needed to make watches from the elaborate to the utilitarian. Thousands of new watches are unveiled in a single week, some unceremoniously placed in a vitrine, others announced in massive press conferences by celebrity ambassadors. What's shown in Basel is what customers have to choose from at retailers for the next calendar year.
Each year the atmosphere is different, but this year's Basel is already injected with two forces from outside the traditional watch industry: currency fluctuations and technology. This week we'll be getting answers to questions like how luxury watchmakers will deal with the Swiss shock and the devalued Euro, and whether we will be seeing a repeat of the quartz crisis with the explosion of smartwatches—most notably the Apple watch, which will have a high end gold version aimed to directly compete with traditional status timepieces. 
Tag Heuer is expected to announce a forthcoming smartwatch made in partnership with a pair of major consumer technology companies and Swatch Group CEO 
 that it would be entering the smartwatch market with "numerous innovative project launches." Even a few months ago it would have been unthinkable that the major conglomerates (Tag Heuer is part of LVMH) would enter the smartwatch space at all, let alone so close on the heels of Apple. 
Like I said, it's a big week for watches.   

=== Title: Audi Takes on BMW, Tesla With Revival of Electric R8 Sports Car - Bloomberg ===

 Audi aims to steal the electric limelight from BMW and Tesla at next week’s Geneva auto show by reworking a sleek sports car as its first emission-free vehicle.
Audi’s green efforts have been overshadowed by Tesla Motors Inc.’s rise and BMW AG’s i3 urban compact and i8 plug-in hybrid sports car. That didn’t sit well with an automaker that associates itself with cutting-edge technology, prompting development chief Ulrich Hackenberg last year to restart the battery-powered R8 e-tron project his predecessor had canned.
“It’s a symbol for the brand” that will help burnish the image of other vehicles, said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. “It’s good that they finally have something to offer in this segment.”
Audi will be the only major luxury-car maker to focus on a zero-emission vehicle at the Geneva International Motor Show. The revamped $165,000 R8 sports car, including the all-new electric variant, will vie for attention with conventionally-fueled luxury cars including the 
, Aston Martin Vulcan and 
 as well as the last 
. For its part, BMW will respond with the 2-Series Gran Tourer, a family-oriented wagon that seats as many as seven.
The electric version of Audi’s edgy R8 can drive as far as 450 kilometers (280 miles) before needing to recharge -- which Audi says can be done in “significantly less than two hours.” The range is more than double the 200 km the i3 can travel on battery power, while Tesla’s Model S can go as far as 502 km.
The R8’s conventional sister model with a V10 gasoline engine takes as little as 3.2 seconds to race to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour, compared with the electric variant’s 3.9 seconds, Audi said Thursday in a statement.
While that’s faster than the i3, which is designed for everyday driving and needs 7.2 seconds, Tesla boasts the Model S can hit that speed in as little as 3.4 seconds.
Buzz from the R8 could help Audi further tighten the race with BMW for the global lead in luxury-car sales. The Volkswagen AG unit narrowed the gap to 70,600 cars last year from 79,700 in 2013. Deliveries by the world’s second-largest luxury-car brand are forecast to grow at about double BMW’s 4 percent pace for the full year, according to Bankhaus Metzler.
Audi and third-ranked Mercedes-Benz both 
 in January. In addition to the three-row, ultra-luxury Pullman sedan, Mercedes will show a racing version of its GT sports car.
With BMW models like the 7-Series sedan aging, the Munich-based manufacturer is “closer to the bottom of its product cycle this year,” said Daniel Schwarz, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank AG. “The spread should close toward the end of the year” between BMW and Audi, which will premiere an overhauled version of the best-selling A4 sedan at the Frankfurt auto show in September.
While the R8 e-tron will only be available “upon customer request” starting this year, it is a sign of things to come. Audi says it will use the car’s technology to help it create a more mainstream vehicle.
In mid-February, Audi bought 
 from Ballard Power Systems Inc. in a deal worth as much as $112 million. Three years ago, the brand opened a site for high-voltage research near its headquarters in Ingolstadt, Germany, including hiring 100 electronics experts.
As part of its clean-car push, Audi will offer a hybrid version of the revamped Q7 sport-utility vehicle, which will also be on display in Geneva. That will follow up on the plug-in hybrid A3 e-tron compact introduced last year.
“For the past five years BMW has enjoyed the youngest fleet” of the three big German luxury-car makers, said Dominic O’Brien, a London-based analyst with Exane Paribas. “In the coming years, you have quite a lot of momentum behind the Audi brand.”

=== Title: LVMH's TAG Heuer to Step Up Smartwatch Production to Meet Demand - Bloomberg ===

Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer will increase production of its smartwatch in coming months after receiving requests from retailers, agents and subsidiaries for some 100,000 timepieces, according to 
’s watch chief.

=== Title: IWC Enters Smartwatch Game With IWC Connect - Bloomberg ===

Another Swiss luxury watchmaker has entered the smartwatch fray. Over the last few months we've seen the introductions of 
, 
, and 
 with Google and Intel to create a smart Carrera. Now IWC Schaffhausen has announced the IWC Connect.
Right off the bat, let's get one thing straight: The IWC Connect is 
 a stand-alone smartwatch. 
Instead, it's a small secondary device that attaches to your watch's strap and adds such things as fitness tracking and network connectivity on top of the traditional mechanical watch. It's unclear how much the IWC Connect will do; the accompanying app is going to be a huge component. Considering that IWC was one of the first luxury watch brands to have a website that didn't look like it was designed for Netscape Navigator, I'm curious to see what rolls out of Schaffhausen. Skeptical, but curious.
For now, additions details are scarce, just as IWC Schaffhausen Chief Executive Officer 
they would be on Bloomberg TV just a few weeks ago, but we should start hearing about things like price, delivery date, and full feature set in the coming months. 
The diversity of approaches we've seen from traditional watchmakers—everything from fitness tracking watches to notification centers to Android-wear equipped gadgets—tells us that Switzerland knows it faces a big challenge, it's greatest since the commercialization of quartz watches in the 1970s. But there's no unified strategy on how to tackle that challenge, and brands are willing to try whatever they can to keep Fitbits and Apple Watches off wrists as long as possible. "Many of our customers are already wearing connected devices alongside their IWC watches," said IWC in an e-mailed statement. "With IWC Connect, however, there is no need any more to have additional devices on your wrist."
Later this year, we'll see if the IWC Connect is up to the task.

=== Title: Londons Steak Restaurant Hawksmoor Heads to New York - Bloomberg ===

Have you heard the one about the British restaurant planning to take steak and fries to the home of steak and fries?
New York is home to the biggest names in the business: Historic restaurants such as 
, which traces its history to 1885, and 
, a relative newcomer from 1887.
To such illustrious establishments we shall soon be able to add the name of Hawksmoor, circa 2006.
The ambitious British restaurant group is to open a monster 14,000 sq. ft. (1,300 sq. meter) venue in Tower 3 of the 
 late next year. 
Some British imports 
 
 But let's face it: no-one has ever been heard muttering that what New York really needs is a London steak house. 
"There is definitely an element of nervousness, because we are tapping into something people have a real emotional attachment to in New York," says Will Beckett, who founded Hawksmoor with his business partner Huw Gott.
"The legendary New York steak houses have been around for a century or more. Often, you think England has a long history compared to the States. But for what we do it's the opposite. "
Hawksmoor had been considering expanding internationally from its current base of five restaurants in London, and one in Manchester, and settled on New York after being invited by 
 to apply for the site in Lower Manhattan.
In  the U.K., Hawksmoor is known for the quality of its grass-fed British beef. In New York, the question is whether to focus on being British or to follow the principle of developing long-term relationships with local farmers?
Beckett says he and Gott plan to take the latter route, which means diners in New York used to grain-fed beef won't be stuck with the grass-fed variety favored in the U.K.
"We want to replicate what we’ve done in the U.K. in the sense of finding the best farmers we can, raising the cattle the way we feel that they should be raised, both in terms of ethics and flavor, and having direct relationships with farmers that we can work on over years," Beckett says. "We want to celebrate really great American produce.
‘‘We are grass-fed fans in the U.K. That's our history. It's almost everyone's history until about 1950. Also, once you start learning about the mass-production techniques on grain and some of the side effects, whether on animal welfare or environmental health, logically people favor grass-fed.
"But I am under no illusion whatsoever that it's very, very stupid to go somewhere and say, 'That thing that you all love, here's something better.' We won't do that. We'll just try and find some stuff that has been fed some grain that is the kind of thing they are used to but with the highest possible ethical standards."
Beckett says he hopes there won't be too much of a culture clash because he and Gott take much of their inspiration from New York restaurateurs, including Danny Meyer of 
 and Keith McNally of 
.
"A lot of stuff that we do here has a pretty heavy American influence: steaks, fries, burgers, lobster rolls, hot dogs. And even some of the stuff that you don’t really expect has influences from people like April Bloomfield (
) or David Chang (
).
"We've been to New York a lot over the years and have brought some stuff back from people who are pushing restaurant boundaries in New York. I like the idea that in a small way we might do that the other way."
"
 is obviously a worry. But you do what you always do, which is to try and learn as much as you can about a place, what makes it tick, and you try and be humble. But you also don’t lose sight of the things that made your restaurant popular in the first place. You have to balance those two things, the local and the Hawksmoor."
In the U.K., Hawksmoor started as a single restaurant in Spitalfields, near the City financial district. (Beckett and Gott had up to then been losing money on other establishments, including a pub and also a Mexican restaurant, Green and Red.) 
Beckett says there's plenty of room in New York for another steak house and he's hopeful Hawksmoor will be known for the quality of its meat, its support of ethical farming and its focus on the environment. Oh, and for great cocktails, too. 
So where does he go now when he wants a good steak in New York?
He names a Keith McNally establishment.
"It isn't even a steak restaurant: It's 
," he says. "The steak is really good. They do good burgers. They do a bit of French bistro food as well. There's a cool bar and the staff are really lovely. There's just a vibe in there I really like."
That's interesting. London-born McNally is himself a British import.

=== Title: The Ferrari 488 GTB Is the Most Beautiful Car in Geneva - Bloomberg ===

On Tuesday in Geneva, Ferrari launched the first major turbocharged car it has made in decades: the 488 GTB. 
It also happens to be the most beautiful car on the show floor. 
The nose of the thing rounds as it reaches the hips, and the delicately sculpted air vents along the side look elegant in Ferrari red. 
“Ferrari has a meaning,” company boss Amedeo Felisa told reporters on Tuesday morning. “We have to have the best and most beautiful car on the market.”
So far, so good. The 488 GTB has a brand new look and a new engine, both derived from the latest F1 racing technology. But in its stunning face and muscular haunches, you can also see a direct relation to Ferraris as far back as the 1975 308 GTB. 
“It’s meant to create the emotion typical of all of our Ferrari cars,” Felisa said. 
This coupe is the replacement for the 458 Italia, which is fitting because it’s considerably lighter and more powerful (by 100 horsepower) than its predecessor. It has a 670-hp rear-placed V8 engine and a 0- to 60-mile-per-hour sprint time of three seconds flat. Top speed is 205mph. 
Most notable, for purists at least, is the fact that Ferrari claims it has not kowtowed to the usual detriments of turbocharging: a lagging engine response time and an anemic engine note. 
In fact, Ferrari assured reporters, the company has obsessed on maintaining the distinct Ferrari scream and its instantaneous throttle response in this latest of its models. “Very deep and then growing,” Felisa described it. 
I haven’t driven it yet, so I can’t say for sure. But I have hope. 
 

=== Title: How to Eat Like a Top Chef in Madrid - Bloomberg ===

Madrid is a magnificent city for dining, from family-run tapas bars to fancy hotels.
Here are a few places I tried this month on a flying visit - my first in a decade - to visit a collaboration between three-Michelin-star chefs Grant Achatz of 
  and David Munoz of 
. I 
 and also picked up a few restaurant tips.
Munoz is a fan of Sacha, where I had my best meal.  "It is absolutely unique," he says. "The cooking is simple but in every dish there is a twist. It's one of my favorites because of the amazing strong flavors. They use local produce and I love everything that comes out of the kitchen. It is an inspiration." Sasha is hidden on a path in the northern Chamartín neighborhood, near the Real Madrid football stadium. The fried oysters escabeche  at 26 euros ($28) are particularly good, and there is a great wine list. There is no English menu and not a lot of English is spoken, so good luck if (like me) you don't know Spanish. There are just a few tables in the charming dining room so it is best to book. 
This restaurant in the posh bit of the mixed Tetuan district is a favorite with chefs. "When it comes to good food and value for money, this small restaurant is one of the best," Munoz says. "The food is simple and very tasty, but also with a twist. They don't try to do anything too complicated, but what they do is amazing." There's an English-language menu. When I asked the waiter slowly and patiently if he spoke English, he turned out to be from London. All the dishes are available in a half portion. Specialties include veal sweetbreads with pork belly, mushrooms and gravy, at 16 euros. That dish is a meaty memory. Lakasa is moving to a new location, so be sure to call ahead. 
This seafood restaurant in the historic Las Letras neighborhood is part of a chain, and none the worse for that. The seared rock octopus with mild aioli (17.40 euros) is unusually tender and sweet: what I would imagine it's like to kiss a mermaid. The service is efficient and friendly.  "I like this place," says chef Jose Pizarro, who owns 
 in the City of London. "It is really good: Simple and informal." This would be a good, reasonably priced restaurant for business. And if you are drinking, still better: There are remarkably good-value wines. There's an English menu and English is spoken. 
This father-and-son taberna near El Barril de las Letras occupies a couple of small rooms, simply decorated with colorful tiles and check tablecloths. There's no English menu and not much English spoken. That doesn't matter as the service is friendly and willing, and you are fine with a plate of ham, a few prawns, maybe a couple of croquetas and a bottle of wine.  I've had worse at high-profile joints in Barcelona. I'm smitten with Madrid.
This corner establishment, across from Retiro park, looks like just a neighborhood tapas bar, but the small plates are a step up gastronomically and there's a restaurant that is casual only in style. The dishes are based around great produce with a daily changng menu that might feature a tripe casserole (cazuelita de callos, 16 euros) so smokey you could inhale it through a vaporizer. It's worth noting that everyone eats late in Madrid. Show up before 7 p.m. and you may feel lonely.
Arzabal, Menendez Pelayo 13, 28009; tel +34-91-409-5661
This is a smart new establishment with excellent food in the upscale Salamanca district. The menu is short, with light, modern dishes grounded in classic Spanish cuisine. The restaurant is attractive, with a lot of blonde wood, and an entire wall decorated with cutlery. Shame about the service. I'd go back for the food, especially an unusual cold starter called marinade mussels pudding (14 euros) on the English menu, which turned out to a light parfait with full-on flavor. 
You're probably more interested in finding hidden gems on back streets than the jewel in the crown of the Ritz. If you are up for a little luxury, this is a very fine restaurant, serving both classic Spanish cuisine and more contemporary creations. The game dishes are as rich as you need to be to eat here. These include raviolo of hare "a la royale" with grilled duck liver and confited pears in Rioja sauce (34 euros),  the deep flavors of the meat balanced with well-judged sweetness. The dining room is every bit as grand and ornate as you might hope. The prices, while high, are not stratospheric. So relax.

=== Title: Bentley Unveils Sports Car With British Styling in Geneva - Bloomberg ===

 Bentley unveiled a two-seat sports car, billed as a “British interpretation” of a high-performance model, as the Crewe, England-based automaker expands its offerings to boost deliveries.
Bentley revealed the EXP 10 Speed 6 last night at an event ahead of the Geneva International Motor Show. Wolfgang Duerheimer, head of the Volkswagen AG unit, said the concept car gives an idea of “where Bentley could go after the Bentayga” sport-utility vehicle goes on sale next year.
The EXP 10 Speed 6 is “the ultimate expression of our vision for Bentley’s future,” Duerheimer said in a statement. “This one car showcases modern automotive design, highly skilled British handcrafting, the finest materials and advanced performance technology.”
Bentley is expanding to meet VW’s goal of boosting the British automaker’s sales to 15,000 vehicles by 2018. The marque’s global deliveries rose 9 percent to a record 11,020 cars last year. Bentley announced a 800 million-pound ($1.22 billion), three-year investment plan in 2013.
The last prototype Bentley showed was the Bentayga three years ago in Geneva. The SUV will be the world’s most expensive and marks a departure from Bentley’s traditional sedans favored by the Queen of England.
Duerheimer said in January that Bentley was 
 adding another model to the lineup after the SUV. The current product portfolio consists of sedans and coupes such as the Continental GT, the Flying Spur and Mulsanne.
Bentley parent VW, Europe’s largest automaker, is making a broader push to expand in lucrative premium cars with brands including Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini.

=== Title: Eight Condiments to Take Your Cookout to the Next Level - Bloomberg ===

You've already stocked up on hot dogs and buns, the most vital accessories for the upcoming long weekend, but now it's time to talk about toppings. W
This bright mash of hot peppers is preserved in a mixture of vinegar with just a touch of sugar, and is great for adding a kick to hot dogs (and other sausages you feel like taking to the grill). A bit on the side with sliced steak is fantastic, too. 
 
: This lacto-fermented kraut involves an addition of kale and chipotle, which gives it a rich, smoky flavor. It's a great way to gussy up a frank when you've got your probiotic-obsessed friends over for a cookout. (Don't be alarmed if the jar fizzes a little when you open it. It's alive.) 
 
:
This tasty, fake-y ketchup gets its vivid purple hue from beets and its sweetness from apples. It's no substitute for Heinz ketchup (no ketchup is, let's be honest), but it adds a wonderful color and complex, umami-rich flavor if you're looking to mix things up. 
 
:
The classic Indian condiment achaar is a traditional sour side to curries and rice, but little known fact: It's also the perfect foil for a Hebrew National in a toasted Martin's potato roll. Tangy, sweet, spicy, and just the right amount of greasy. 
:
For those who like sweetness on their dogs, you can't do much better than a simple onion jam. This one from Mimi's is tingling with sherry vinegar and black pepper, giving it the slightest edge. 
 
and
New Mexico's green chilis lend this tomato sauce some brightness and serious heat (especially if you go with #4, the hottest on their scale). Smear it onto a hot dog—we find it mixes particularly well with Mustard & Co.'s sweet and spicy mustard—or better yet, put it on your next hamburger. 
 
: Mustard is a hot dog's best friend, and Kozlik's intensely spicy mustards have more flavor and fire than most. This pickled version adds crunchy texture in addition to vinegar-y snap.
 

=== Title: 1940s Vintage Bovet Chronograph - Bloomberg ===

Sometimes you may think you really know a watch brand only to uncover a vintage gem that shows you an entirely different side of the manufacture. This is one of those times. The Bovet chronograph we have here is a restrained dress watch that perfectly embodies the 1940s and shows a rarely seen, understated side of the brand. 
 traces its history to the early 19th century, 1822, to be exact, when it was founded by the three Bovet brothers in Fleurier, Switzerland. After one of them took a trip to China, the manufacture began specializing in producing ornate gold watches, highly decorated with engraving, enamel, and gems, specifically for that expanding export market. The brand faded out of existence for a bit after the quartz crisis of the 1970s and '80s but was recently revived and is making watches in that same over-the-top historic style to very high standards. 
That's the Bovet you thought you knew, though. This here is a very different Bovet.
Instead of dragon motifs, we get a basic, two-button chronograph with a highly legible dial and a slick profile. The 40 mm stainless steel case is thin, and the shape is accentuated by the rectangular pushers set into the side. That width might be middle of the road by today's standards, but in the 1940s it would have looked like a dinner plate.
Considering the steel construction, the size, and the telemeter scale on the dial, I wouldn't be surprised if this watch originally sat on the wrist of an officer during World War II. The strap is actually original, too, and comes with a white gold Bovet-signed buckle even though the watch is steel.
Opening the caseback, you'll find a very basic chronograph movement. Everyone during this era was buying movements from suppliers such as Valjoux and Landeron, instead of making their own, and Bovet was no different. This Landeron isn't decorated much, but it is large and fills the case properly, with only a small spacer around the edge. Bovet had patents for its own monopusher split-seconds chronograph movements, but this is a much more basic (and much less expensive) style of chrono.
What makes this watch truly special are the little details of the case and dial. The lugs are the Cornes de Vache (cow horn) style, like a number of 
, and they're complemented by a large onion-style crown that you might find on a pilot's watch. The combination of dressy and sporty features are unusual but work here.
The dial has the gold numerals and hands against the soft-brushed silver dial, and the inky black printing is offset by the bright red telemeter track. And that signature at 12 o'clock? Don't even get me started. It's so charming it hurts.
This Bovet Chronograph is available from 
 and is priced at 15,000 Swiss francs (approximately $15,175). 

=== Title: H. Moser Releases Branding-Free Concept Watch - Bloomberg ===

Independent watchmaker 
 has released a minimalist concept watch that has no branding or markings on the dial. This approach flies in the face of how the watch industry usually does things, slapping brand names, explanatory labels, and sometimes flat-out stupid text on almost every surface. The result is both beautiful and surprising.
The ideal behind this concept watch (the official name is ref. 1343-0XXX) was to strip away all the visible branding and nonessential markings to show off the purity of each component. The 40.8mm white gold case has a mix of brushed and polished surfaces, especially noticeable on its faceted sides, and each matching hand stands out in a way that's almost startling at first glance. 
Considering all the open space, the finish of the dial is critical here. Moser went with gray fumé, a special finish unique to the brand. ("Fumé" is French for "smoked.") It's a mixture of a sunburst finish and a grained finish, darker at the edges and brighter at the center with a soft matte look. Moser has been using these dials on its watches for years, and now without the text and extra indicators, you can really appreciate the dial itself. If it weren't as nice as it is, this design could easily end up looking too minimal and austere.
It's important to note, though, that while the front of the watch is clean, an engraved "M" is still on the crown as well as the usual engraving on the caseback. The (incredible) movement is also still visible through the sapphire caseback. Would it have been nice for Moser to carry the ethos through the entire watch? Sure. But it's still an admirable statement in an industry that's all about overt branding and communicating its worth as loudly as possible. The subtext is that Moser is hoping that you, and those around you, become familiar enough with its designs, that the shape, dial, and hands speak louder than any logo.

=== Title: London’s Top Chefs Share Their Secret Local Dining Hangouts - Bloomberg ===

London's leading chefs cook some of the best gourmet food in the world. But which are the local restaurants where they keep going back on their day off? I polled a number of them, and here's what they had to say.
"
 in Notting Hill. We go on the weekends as it’s good for kids. It’s relaxed, informal and fun, and the food is good."
"
 in East Dulwich. I like to go there for Sunday lunch. You can have a really good beer and amazing meat or fish."
"
 in Clapham. They just do very good wholesome cooking. I like to go with my dad [Chef Albert Roux]. Last time we had a roast chicken to share. It was a damn good chicken properly roasted with damn good roast potatoes. It's just perfect for Sunday lunch rather than cooking at home."
"
 at Heathrow. The grilled meats are exceptional, especially the lamb. The robata grill and marination process makes the flavor immense."
"
 is local to us in Clapham. It's an ideal neighborhood restaurant for weekend lunches. They are a group of young chefs doing great home cooking from the heart, inspired by what’s fresh at the market."
"
 at Climpson's Arch. The food is excellent, and all the staff are great. I used to be the chef there before I handed over to Andy (Oliver). I always enjoy going back."
 "
 in Notting Hill. They have wonderful Greek food, a great atmosphere, and are always very welcoming. It’s around the corner from my home, so I love popping in there."
"
. It's walking distance from home, and I love the menu and the food. Excellent service, and now that the kids are all old enough to sit down for a whole meal, I love to take the family there."
"
. They serve great food at a great price in a very casual atmosphere. It’s perfect."
 "The Great British Mayfair Fish & Chip Restaurant [soon to be known as the Mayfair Chippy]. It's a little place on North Audley Street where you have nice fish and chips."
"
. I love what they are doing. It's really simple, good food. When I was young, mum had a cheese fondue set, but she never used it. I used to beg her. I went into Soif, and they had a fondue for two. I nearly lost my mind."
"
 Lebanese on King's Road. It's absolutely splendid. It is very good quality, everything is delicious and well-seasoned—not too heavy—and the restaurant is as clean as you could imagine."
 "
. The food is solid, and the service is some of the best in London."
"
. It's just round the corner, and I've been going there for years. It is consistently good every time, and it's good to support somewhere local."
"
, by Steve Drake. Simple but delicious cooking. Food as it should be: a lovely little restaurant in a beautiful village."
. It's a great family-run Thai, and Chim uses recipes from her mum."
"
 It's a little sushi shop. It's cheap as chips, and the sushi is fantastic. It looks nothing special. There's hardly anywhere to sit, and everyone is Japanese. I go there a lot with my family."
"
 in Marlow. I've been almost once a month since it opened. It has a lovely pub feel and is run by a friend of mine."
"
. It's a golden oldie and just the epitome of a local restaurant. I love eating there."
"
 in Streatham. It's a great place to go for brunch. They are family friendly and very gracious. Nothing is a problem. They do an amazing short-rib hash."
"
. Peter Gordon's food always hugs me back. I love the breakfast in particular."
"
 in North Audley Street. I always order their truffled spaghetti and grilled calamari. It’s more than a Bolognese-old-fashioned Italian: The food is excellent, and overall it’s relaxed, cosy, and friendly. A perfect local."
"
, in Bray. It's not too far from my home, and the food is simply beautiful. It's of a consistently high standard." 
"
. It's a local Persian place off Edgware Road. I like everything from the bread and the small dips through to the lamb kebab, which is the specialty."
"
. Stevie Parle is one of the most interesting chefs around, and he uses great ingredients."
"
. It's family-style cooking with simple ingredients properly cooked. Another of my favorites is A. Wong. It's modern Chinese. He likes to experiment with different ingredients. It's very good."
"
. I love the fact the food is hearty and seasonal and intelligently cooked. It's honest food at an honest price, and there are lots of very well-priced wines by the glass."
"
. I go there a lot. It's all small plates, and the wines are amazing. I like places that evolve throughout the day. You can go there for a sandwich or eggs at breakfast, and in the evening, the anchovy toast is amazing."
"
, Ossie Gray's place, is right around the corner: calm environment, lovely team, and great food cooked by the lovely Humphrey Fletcher, ex- River Caff, bien sur! Cracking wine list, and the lovely little Negroni on arrival is a must." 
"
. I go there all the time because it is failsafe, and I always have steak tartare with endive salad, [with] a good bloody Mary on the side."
"
 for the simplicity of the food and the seasonality. It's a very adult place. I take the kids to Granger & Co. It's really friendly."
"
 in Bethnal Green. It's a great space, and the food is really up there. I'm not normally into that type of food, as it can be underwhelming—style and obscurity over flavor—but this place has it all. It's also got a wonderful natural-wine list, and it's good value."
 on Camden Lock. It's consistently good, which is important. I like all the sushi. To be honest, there isn't a wide range of local restaurants in Camden, where I live." 
 

=== Title: The Aston Martin Vulcan Showcases the Brand’s ‘Dark Arts’ - Bloomberg ===

On Tuesday in Geneva, Aston Martin finally unveiled the Vulcan, the car Aston executives are calling “the most extreme supercar” they have made. 
This is the car that has a V12 engine with 800 horsepower, a six-speed sequential gearbox, Brembo racing brakes, and a carbon fiber monocoque that helps the car stay under 3,000 pounds. The price isn’t lightweight by any means, however: it’ll cost £1.5 million, or $2.3 milllion.
 
Its name originated in British aerospace (not, as you might assume, from the original Vulcan, played by recently departed actor Leonard Nimoy). The Royal Air Force flew a jet bomber named the Vulcan from 1956 to 1984. Aston bought the trademark to the name three months ago. 
The first things you notice when you see the vehicle are the huge dents in the hood—air vents—and the enormous rear spoiler. There are carbon fiber accents throughout, all the better for making this animal as light as possible. From the rear, you’ll see crazy orange tail lights that stick out like quills from a futuristic hedgehog. On Tuesday at the Motor Show, Aston Martin head Andy Palmer said it hints at the design and performance we can expect from the three new model lines Aston will introduce by 2020.
“The Vulcan expresses the dark art of Aston Martin to perfection,” Palmer told reporters. 
Which, as you might expect, means it’s fit only to drive on a race track. No suburban wandering allowed in this thing. 
Twenty-four will be made. 
 

=== Title: A Single Shrimp for $13? Yes, It's Worth It at Lupulo - Bloomberg ===

It’s not every day you come across grilled 
in New York. These big lipstick-red shrimp, with their firm, sweet meat, come from off the coast of Portugal and Spain. If you’re eating the buggers properly—that is to say, breaking the heads off and tipping them into your mouth, then crushing them to get at the tasty bits inside—you might not even feel badly about spending $13 on each. 
That’s the going rate at 
, a new Portuguese restaurant on the edge of K-town that serves these delicious shrimp confidently—hot off the grill, nearly plain. On a recent evening, the couple next to me ordered a bottle of wine and 18 
. They took them apart one by one, tearing bread to swipe on the plate where the rich, dark-colored juice from the shrimp heads was melding with olive oil and lemon juice. By the end, nothing was left but the thin outer shells of the shrimp heads, sucked clean and flattened as if ready for the recycling bin.
While this is one extremely tasty way to spend an evening at Lupulo, there’s a lot more on offer, from wee little bites like salt cod fritters and shrimp turnovers, to clams in wine with crusty grilled bread and a mousse-y chicken liver pate with pickled grapes. Not everything is traditionally Portuguese. (That delicious ham is, in fact, from Virginia, and a couple of beers on the list are brewed in nearby Brooklyn.) 
Portuguese food is not so well-represented in New York, and Lupulo goes out of its way to show off some simple, rustic Portuguese cooking, such as a delightfully shrimpy 
somewhere between a savory bread pudding and a bowl of grits. It’s no surprise that chef-owner George Mendes is also behind Aldea, the brainy, modern Portuguese restaurant in Flatiron that opened in 2009. In that sleeker, more luxurious space, Mendes turns out sleeker, more luxurious food. (The four-course dinner for $79 at Aldea can be fantastic and full of surprises.) But Lupulo is not that kind of restaurant, nor is it trying to be. The mood here is more casual, noisy, and messy—a place to stand around and gulp cold beer, rip the heads off crustaceans, and pull tiny sardine bones out of your mouth. (Of course, they’re served whole.)
While it seems Mendes can’t resist slightly more complex compositions such as that asparagus dressed up with globs of sea urchin, the best dishes at Lupulo are truly unfussy: a few grilled sardines strewn with red peppers, a pot of 
 a 
, the traditional casserole of salt cod. Lupulo doesn’t mess around with the structure of the latter too much: It comes in layers of potato, caramelized onion, and big pieces of salt cod with olives and hardboiled eggs. The olives on top have been almost dehydrated by the heat, so they’re intensely flavored and crisp. As you eat it, your mouth buzzes with salt and umami. It’s delicious, generously portioned, and could easily serve more than two people.
If you need something faster and more consoling, there’s half a chicken, marinated in white wine and smoked paprika and cooked over the grill, served with a bowl of skinny French fries and an endless supply of piri piri sauce—a Portuguese crush of hot peppers in oil. What else do you need? A glass or two of cold, barely sparkling vinho verde and the kind of friend by your side who can talk over a crowd. It’s loud in Lupulo, especially around happy hour, when Midtown Manhattan’s after-work crowd takes over the massive, stretch, horseshoe bar in the center of the dining room, along with the few tables at the edges of the room. 
Desserts don’t always deliver. The eggy custard, charged with vanilla and cinnamon, has a wonderful flavor, but half the pleasure of a classic 
 stems from the buttery, layered pastry; this one is thin, flat, and tough. The rice pudding is better if you like a stubbornly milky rice pudding, loose and creamy.
Service can be inconsistent, with inaccurate wait times. Some dishes you order never arrive. A few of the restaurant’s ticks are downright confusing: Why do you get large plates for your appetizers, then tiny ones for the larger dishes? Why don’t the servers ever seem to know if a dish is meant for you or for someone else? “Did you order the clams?” “Did you order the sardines?” Yes, we did—but on one evening, they never arrived. Sometimes this chaos is enough to spoil an evening. Other times, a warm bowl of the kitchen’s thick, comforting bread soup made rich with shrimp stock and a wobbly poached egg will be more than enough to temper any exasperation. 
: One star (Good)
: Carabinero ($13 each); Salt cod croquettes ($5); Fava beans with blood sausage ($9); Grilled chicken with piri piri ($14); 
 ($48)
: Midtown after-work crowds, visiting chefs from out of town, chic groups of Portuguese-American friends, seafood lovers

Approximately 19 weeks ago I arrived back stateside from an epic, whirlwind journey—having blitzed my way through four European fashion capitals in a nearly 20-day circuit of fashion runways, presentations, and events. By now, the clothes I saw and reported on during that trip in January are for sale at your favorite designer stores and in department stores and online retail destinations—and thus, the evolution of the fashion industry. Which means, it’s time to do it again.

, who will be holding a presentation for the first time—before taking the show and collection back to New York to be part of New York's first standalone men's fashion week in mid-July. Emerging talent to watch (since a third of the schedule is made up of brands less than five years old) include the popular

=== Title: Why the Hottest Restaurants Make Us Wait in the Cold - Bloomberg ===

It's Thursday night in London's Soho and it's not looking good for the hungry.
Outside 
, a Sri Lankan café, diners are told there is a wait of as long as two hours for a table. A few doors along Frith Street, customers are standing in 
 until seats come free for tapas. A few streets away, people line up in the rain to get into 
 for Taiwanese snacks. Nearby, the casual Venetian bàcaro 
 is full, too.
All are no-reservations restaurants.
How did we get to this situation, where many London diners accept (albeit with some grumbling) that they can't just phone up and book a table? And why do some restaurateurs reckon it's acceptable to make us wait?
Two overseas restaurants – one in Barcelona and the other in New York – inspired the fathers of this trend (yes, they are all men). Its history in London largely dates to January 2007, when Barrafina opened its doors. Diners 
as long as 95 minutes for a table.
The inspiration came from 
, a tapas restaurant that was a favorite of restaurateur Sam Hart, who lived in Barcelona before opening Barrafina in London with his brother, Eddie.
"I absolutely loved Cal Pep and I think we were the first people to do eating at counters in London, and the first to do no-reservations at that sort of level," Hart says, adding that they then became  "part of a wave."
"We had 23 seats and couldn't just have one sitting, with everyone booking it. You have to be slightly more aggressive, or pushy, in trying to get people to come and eat at times that might not be 8 p.m. on a Friday night.
"If you are trying to provide a high level of service, you can do it two ways. One is to hire loads of staff and charge high prices. Or you charge much less but effectively force diners to come at a time they wouldn't normally choose.
"On a normal day at Barrafina there are four waiters, five chefs and a couple of kitchen porters, so the ratio of staff to customers is right up there with fancy-pants restaurants."
The restaurateur who tends to attract most of the flak when it comes to the no-bookings trend is Russell Norman, who opened the first Polpo with business partner Richard Beatty in September 2009. After a few weeks they stopped taking dinner bookings when Norman recalled that there were no reservations in the Venetian bars that were his inspiration, nor at a restaurant in New York by which he was also influenced: 
, on the Lower East Side.
"At Polpo, people were booking far ahead and then traveling to come and eat. That inflates expectations. Then when you arrive at a scruffy restaurant, you feel disappointed. Meanwhile, the door kept opening with local people from Soho who couldn't get in. So we had diners who just didn't get it but we didn't have room for the people we wanted to welcome.
"High rents in central London mean small restaurants can only survive if they maximize use of seats. Everyone wants to come for dinner at the same time. If people can't get a table around 8 p.m., it's difficult to sell at what we call shoulder times, say 6 or 10. And then you get people who walk in at, say, 7, the restaurant is empty and you have to tell them you are fully booked. It is a bad use of time and space and it is awfully frustrating."
When Karam Sethi of 
 (the owners of the Michelin-starred 
) decided to open casual venues 
, 
 and 
, which all turned out to be wildly popular, the lessons weren't lost on him.
"In an average day at Gymkhana, you can get up to 30 no-shows or late cancelations," he says. "Bao has 32 seats and is doing 300 (covers) a day. At Hoppers, it's 230 to 250 a day for 36 seats. Restaurants with so few seats can't risk accepting reservations."
Hoppers has now moved to a queue-management system called 
i, that allows would-be diners to wander off while they wait for their table. They receive a text when it is ready. This helps eliminate lines outside restaurants and can take the frustration out of queuing. (When I went to Hoppers recently, I did my virtual queuing across the road at 
, drinking pisco sours for about half an hour.)
Other restaurants have abandoned no-bookings policies. Chef Jason Atherton tried it at 
, which opened last June. The model was based on his 
, in Hong Kong, but customers quickly started complaining in London, the chef's executive sommelier Laure Patry says.
, a popular burger chain, opened in November 2011 with a no-reservations policy that restaurateur Scott Collins says he didn't want anyway.
"We had to fill the place but couldn't manage the flow without a reservations system, which we couldn't afford.  So we had to think on our feet.
"We got a massive kicking for it on social media. It was like we were the whipping boys, along with Polpo."
MeatLiquor has now grown into a chain with a sophisticated system that allows the company to manage reservations and even offer people tables at other branches.
"Anyway, there's not so much complaining now," Collins says. "It's like people have bored themselves to tears."
Just in case you do see no-bookings policies as a bane of modern life, here's a little historical perspective.
, a fish-and-oyster restaurant that 
, has never taken reservations.
"We do get the odd person who phones up to reserve a table, but we politely refuse and tell them it's first come, first served," says the owner, Richard Barfoot, 79.
"Strangely enough, we are transferring over to a computer after all this time. I suppose I won't be living forever and my daughters will take over, and they seem to feel we should be looking to the future rather than living in the past. We'll give it a shot.
"But I don't think the reservation side will change. It's like a club and people like it that way."

=== Title: Tips on How to Get a Table at the Hottest Restaurants - Bloomberg ===

had just joined 
as maître d' in 1990 when a man telephoned wanting to dine at 10:30 p.m. the next day.
"My instinct was to take the reservation: He had the most elegant voice I had ever heard," says Peire, 56. "But I was new, and the general manager was standing in front of me shaking his head."
Peire offered the caller a table in the bar, with a promise that he would do everything possible to find space in the dining room on the night.
"This is 
," said the Academy Award winning actor, best known as  Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars. "I have never taken dinner in a bar in my life and I don't intend to break that rule tomorrow. I shall dine elsewhere."
So much attention is devoted to chefs nowadays, it is easy to forget that in a fashionable restaurant, the maître d' generally decides whether you get a table, at what time, and where you sit. In many ways, he is more important than the chef, a fact that used to be widely recognized.
"To have a famous maître d’hôtel greet you respectfully by your surname, to greet him in turn familiarly is a strong tonic for your ego,” Vogue said in 1936. The magazine is quoted on the website of 
, which itself was founded by a maître d', Giovanni Quaglino.
A good maître d' will make an instant assessment of how much effort to make to accommodate you when tables are as prized as tickets for the Centre Court at Wimbledon.
Just ask three of the leaders at London dining rooms: Peire of the Ivy,  
of 
and Silvano Giraldin of 
. Elena Salvoni of 
, the best-known woman maître d',
after a short illness. She was 95.
"The maître d' is like the host of a party," says Gibraltar-born Peire, who is a director of the Ivy and known for his TV appearances as 
. "You have got to decide on the evening who feels, looks and sounds like they are going to fit in with the party.  If they don't, and you can afford to turn them away, you turn them away.
"People always think there are secrets about how to get a good table, but no. You need to look pleased to be there. You need to give a good impression. You listen to what people have to say. You ask the right questions. You dress appropriately. Don't overdress. Be friendly. It always helps if you talk to staff. There are regular customers at the Ivy only because they are charming to the staff.
"Most of our regulars are not famous people. We just treat them all like stars. Another thing: You need to go back to places and have a list of, say, five restaurants you support regularly. And when you go back to those restaurants, you'll be treated like a friend."
In Mayfair, 
is the face of 
, which he joined in 1981, nine years after arriving from his native Bolivia.
He loves his job and reckons he can assess within seconds which table someone will be joining from the guest's body language, the way he dresses and the way he talks.
"A maître d' can make or break a restaurant," he says. "I do see, every so often, some of my colleagues in restaurants once they make it to the maitre d' status, they think they are god's gift to customers.
"But if you are snooty or have a bad attitude with the customers, the ones who are paying your wages, your mortgage, you will never really make it in a restaurant with longevity," says Adorno, 62.
Across Mayfair, Silvano Giraldin, 67, was born in Padua, Italy, worked at 
for 37 years and remains a director. For decades, he was the gatekeeper of the restaurant, where his favorite guests included Charlie Chaplin and Princess Diana.
The princess used to dine with 
at table 15, but never returned after paparazzi gathered one night, and she suspected Le Gavroche had tipped them off - an idea that Giraldin dismisses.
Even celebrities can't always get what they want.
The Rolling Stones were regulars in the early days of Le Gavroche until the restaurant introduced a strict dress code. They didn't return. 
was untroubled when warned in advance that gentlemen must wear a jacket and tie. He simply turned up in a voluminous frock, dressed as 
.
Was he allowed in?
"Of course," Giraldin says. "You can't turn away a lady."
Back at the Ivy, Peire is keen to emphasize that his focus is on service not celebrity.
Fair enough, Fernando, but just one more anecdote please.
"Someone rang and said, 'This is 
. Do you have a table in 10 minutes?' I didn't recognize the name - he was a producer - but the way he asked meant either that he knew his name carried weight or that he had no idea where he was calling.
"The Ivy was like Rick's Café in Casablanca in those days. Everybody wanted to come.
"I took the risk that he might be our sort of customer, which he was because he arrived with David Bowie and his wife. They looked extraordinary.
"David was wearing a beautiful pink suit. I remember talking to him about how beautiful his shoes were. They were big and pointy and he'd had them hand-made in Switzerland. And Iman had had her hair teased for a photo shoot. It was enormous, like a massive light bulb on her head.
"They were utterly charming and the pair of them cut a real dash.
"They made everybody's night."

=== Title: Bugatti Sells 450th and Last Veyron - Bloomberg ===

 Volkswagen AG sold the 450th and final Bugatti Veyron, marking the end of one of the most exclusive supercars ever built.
The last Veyron is an open-top Grand Sport Vitesse variant, which boasts 1,200 horsepower. The car, called La Finale, will be on display next week at the Geneva Motor Show. The 450 Veyrons were sold for an average price of about 2.3 million euros ($2.6 million) each, Molsheim, France-based Bugatti said Monday in a statement.
After buying the Bugatti brand in 1998, Volkswagen revived the carmaker, which was originally founded by designer Ettore Bugatti. The goal was to develop a vehicle both powerful enough to drive faster than 400 kilometers (249 miles) per hour as well as stylish and comfortable enough for a trip to the opera. The Veyron was first presented in 2005 and is part of Volkswagen’s effort to show it can compete on all levels of the auto industry.
“An unprecedented chapter in automotive history has reached its climax,” Bugatti President Wolfgang Duerheimer said in a statement. “Even 10 years after its market launch, the Veyron remains unique in many respects.”
The final Veyron was purchased by an unidentified customer from the Middle East. About half the cars were sold in Europe, and about a quarter were delivered in the U.S., according to Bugatti.
VW, the world’s second-largest automaker, is working on a new Bugatti supercar and is testing at least three different concepts for a 
 to the Veyron, including one with an engine as much as 25 percent stronger than the 1,200-horsepower motor of the Grand Sport Vitesse, people familiar with the plans said in October. VW design chief Walter de Silva has said the new Bugatti could be unveiled at the end of this year or early-2016 and will be “art.”
Like the Veyron, its successor will vie for the world’s most affluent car-buyers with the likes of Italy’s Pagani Automobili SpA, McLaren Automotive Ltd.’s 
 or Koenigsegg Automotive AB’s Agera model. The Swedish supercar specialist will present the Agera RS and a new “megacar” dubbed Regera in Geneva next week.
The Veyron set industry records not just for speed, but also for losing money, according to estimates from Max Warburton, a Singapore-based analyst for Sanford Bernstein Ltd. Including development costs, VW may lose 4.6 million euros per vehicle on the Veyron, Warburton said.
“The spending they have done on every little part of the car is totally crazy, but it’s also of course setting the agenda of the supercar, the hyper-car league,” Christian Brandt, chief designer at Danish supercar maker Zenvo Automotive A/S, said in an interview.
VW, which sold 
 last year, can absorb Bugatti’s costs thanks to the money it makes with brands such as Audi, Porsche and Skoda. While VW doesn’t release financial details for Bugatti, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company has said the costs are moderate compared to what rivals spend on activities such as Formula 1 racing.
“You need prestige projects like this to showcase technological excellence,” said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. “Yes, it costs money, but it won’t cause VW any turbulence.”

=== Title: London Steamed Bun Lovers Get a Second Chance to Take a Bao - Bloomberg ===

, a small Taiwanese restaurant that instantly became one of London's most popular dining destinations, will add a second branch, little more than a year after opening for the first time.
Bao opened in April 2015, and its popularity quickly saw would-be diners queuing down the street. 
The new Bao, 
, in London's Fitzrovia, is scheduled to open in May, featuring a similar formula of inexpensive Chinese snacks and steamed buns, along with new sharing dishes. There will be the same no-reservations policy, but more seats: 47 (with another 10 planned for outside) compared with the former 26. There will also be a greatly expanded drinks list, with cocktails and Champagne.
"We were overwhelmed by the success of Bao Soho, but the small space always meant we would be restricted in the dishes we could offer," said Wai Ting Chung, who started Bao as a street-food stall with her brother, Shing Chung, and his wife, chef Erchen Chang. "Taking on a new site allows us to cook a new exciting range of dishes and a different environment in which to experience Bao."
The success might have been a surprise if it weren't for the backers: 
. That's the company of Karam, Jyotin and Sunaina Sethi, whose restaurants include 
, the Indian establishment in Mayfair that won the 
 in its first year; and 
, a Sri Lankan cafe in Soho where there are queues of more than two hours for a table. JKS also owns 
, and backs 
 — serving Champagne and hot dogs — Kitchen Table and Lyle's.
Bao's Fitzrovia menu will feature snacks such as cured ribcap, pickles and fermented chili bean dip; beef cheek and tendon sausage; oysters with green chili pickle; and crispy bird's feet with hot sauce. Sharing dishes will include crab, rice broth; and ox heart with Sichuan dressing. Chi Shiang rice bowls will include beef shortrib with scallop and beef tea and baby garlic; and octopus with bottarga.

=== Title: The 11 Craziest Shoes From London Collections Men - Bloomberg ===

For me, one of the best and most important parts about 
 is the ability to see a runway look from head to toe to form a proper opinion. If you’re buried in the back, behind the heads of various other industry folk (or Samuel L. Jackson’s bright blue Kangol hat, as was my case at the Burberry show earlier today), there’s a likelihood you’re not able to see beyond waist length. This is a shame. I’ve found that the bottom half often reveals the most interesting—or at least most entertaining—parts of a runway look.
In my last few days at

Some were expected, from designers such as Astrid Andersen, who’s known for his avant-garde edge, while others were a surprise, like from Coach, where the otherwise funky, skate-park inspired collection was slightly overshadowed by the appearance of fur shower slides and too busy hybrid-print high-top sneakers.

=== Title: London Fish Restaurant Sweetings, Loved by Bankers and Gangters - Bloomberg ===

It's lunchtime in London's financial district, and men in dark suits crowd the bar, sharing jokes as they drink beer from silver tankards. A woman stands at a linen-clothed counter, awaiting orders for the oysters displayed on an antique marble slab in the window.
In the next room, with a high ceiling and nicotine-cream walls, more men at communal tables help themselves to the bread and butter as they examine the "
."
If time hasn't exactly stood still at Sweetings, which describes itself as probably the oldest fish and oyster restaurant in London, neither has it moved very quickly.
The restaurant only opens at lunchtime, five days a week, and there are no reservations. Just show up, order a black velvet  – Champagne and Guinness, created in 1861 to mourn the death of Prince Albert – and wait your turn. 
Starters range from a £7 lobster bisque ($10) to £20.75 dressed crab, as well as potted shrimps, prawn cocktail and smoked eel. The 14 mains, costing from £15 to £45, feature Dover sole, Cornish brill and other seafood specialties. The menu advises: "All Fish can be Fried, Grilled or Poached, please ask a member of staff for the best way to order."
And don't think about ordering tea or coffee after your meal – neither is served. There is, though, a fine selection of brandies and vintage port.
Sweetings opened on its present site in 1889, though the company's history dates to the 1830s, when it was called John S. Sweetings, Fish and Oyster Merchant. It supplied fish and ice to country houses.
Women started showing up in numbers to eat only 20 to 30 years ago, and credit cards were accepted for the first time some 15 years ago. Otherwise, little has changed since Sweetings was a favorite restaurant of the painter 
. Even its Gothic-style building is historic: Constructed in 1869 and designed by Frederick J. Ward, the 
' shape resembles New York's Flatiron Building.
"People like it the way it is," says Richard Barfoot, who bought Sweetings in 2001 from the widow of his friend Graham Needham, a chef and host whose hospitality meant many lunches extended into the evenings.
"I had an interest in Sweetings when Graham bought it (around 1980)  because he was an old friend," says Barfoot, who turns 80 this year. "His clientele in those days was fantastic. They came in from Fleet Street, they came in from the Stock Exchange. They had long lunches and he made them even longer."
Not all the guests would entirely qualify for the status of gentleman. 
"We used to get some undesirables in here, crooks of the highest quality," Barfoot says, laughing. "There was one, 
, he was a South London boy, he used to come in with his henchmen for late-afternoon drinks. He was a very charming fellow, but a real tough guy.
"One time he said to Graham, 'How much do you want for this place? How about a million pounds?' Graham said he wasn't interested, and he wasn't even going to discuss it. Then he said to one of his henchmen, 'Go out and get the suitcase and show him what a million pounds look like.' And they brought in the case with all the notes in it. Graham said,  'I don’t want to know and if you are going to trouble me like that you can get out now.'"
If that's a fishy tale or not, what happened to Francis is well-known. "He was
," says Barfoot.
He knows the City well. He began work in the financial district in 1950 as an invoice clerk for a fish company. He spent the next 66 years in the fish business, starting his own company, Barfoot Ltd., selling to hotels and restaurants. He still supplies the seafood to Sweetings, all of it from sustainable sources.
Softly spoken, smartly dressed and with the most beautiful of manners, Barfoot surveys the restaurant from his usual table, seated with his wife, Ann, and one of his daughters, Sue Knowler. While enjoying memories, he turns to the future.
“I suppose I won’t be living forever and my daughters will take over, and they seem to feel we should be looking to the future rather than living in the past. We’ll give it a shot. But I don’t think the reservation side will change. It’s like a club, and people like it that way.”
Knowler smiles as a uniformed waiter serves a simple plate of Dover sole. The waiter, Allan Gardner, later says that he joined Sweetings for a five-week temporary job in 1988 and never left.
What would Knowler change if she had her way?
"Nothing really," she says. "Why would you change anything?"

, and travels constantly to his three establishments in Singapore, three in Hong Kong, and two in Shanghai. His London tally is seven.)
All this is so tiring to contemplate, I need to take a seat at the bar of Social Wine & Tapas. That's the British chef's new outlet in Marylebone, which is also home to 
 and is rapidly becoming a destination for diners.
Each place Atherton opens is distinct (names aside). Social Wine & Tapas represents his first attempt at, well, wine and tapas. This is a competitive field in London. Chef Nieves Barragan has just won U.K. restaurant of the year for Barrafina; and the 
 has fine venues such as Ember Yard and Opera Tavern.
If you wonder what Atherton can bring to the party that is new, the answer is Laure Patry, the sommelier who has been with him for more than a decade. She is one of the heroes of his group, the Social Company, and here takes charge of her own venue.
This is the first Atherton establishment that isn't chef-led. There's a separate wine shop, and you could happily spend an afternoon (as I have done) exploring the wine list without bothering too much about the food. Fortunately, the food holds its own against the existing competition. It is very good.
Head Chef Frankie Van Loo previously worked with Atherton at Pollen Street Social and Social Eating House. The menu covers the usual Spanish bases—padron peppers, ham croquettes, a selection of hams—but then becomes more catholic, like a Graham Greene hero.
The cheeses are British; the chipirones are Sichuan-spiced; raw Orkney sea scallop comes with yuzu (Asian citrus fruit) and togarashi (Japanese seasoning); chargrilled carrots and burnt aubergine are served with miso. But we shouldn't be surprised.
Atherton—who has a season at El Bulli on his résumé—created Maze for Ramsay in 2005. That restaurant was a game-changer, serving French food with an Asian twist by way of Spain. Social Wine & Tapas is more restrained, but the DNA is there.
The venue is on two floors, with a bar at street level and the main dining room in the basement. Downstairs is more buzzy and fun. There are great simple dishes, such as grilled sardine, whose flavor is picked out with citrus yogurt rather than lemon.
Norfolk suckling pig is served with roasted caramel and sherry caramel. Broccolini comes with chilli, pear, and air-dried tuna. The flavors are bold, yet balanced. Often there is a twist and still the focus remains on the quality ingredients. 
That's evidenced by dishes such as the heirloom tomato salad, truffle burrata, basil, and gazpacho vinaigrette. It's fresh and colorful, yes, but it's about flavor, not frippery.
Only on a couple of dishes does the seasoning go awry. I'm thinking particularly of the salty guacamole served with the juicy rose veal and foie gras burgers with pulled pork.
Otherwise, everything is spot on. 
But my first love is the wine list, which promiscuously wanders Europe like a backpacker on a rail pass. There are flights (of fancy) too, including a trio of chardonnays for 27.50 pounds ($43).
Atherton makes it all look so effortless. Social Wine & Tapas is another "Oops! ... I did it again" restaurant.
Social Wine & Tapas is at 39 James Street, Marylebone, London, W1U 1DL; +44-20-7993-3257 or

=== Title: Ferrari Introduces a Turbo Engine In The New 488 GTB - Bloomberg ===

Ferrari has gone turbo. 
Today it unveiled the 2016 488 GTB, the first Ferrari since the 1970s to use turbocharged power rather than a natural aspiration in an “entry level” engine. 
The 488 GTB is a 3.9-liter V8 supercar that gets 660 horsepower and 560 pounds-feet of torque. Top speed is 205mph. It will hit 60mph in 3 seconds. Flat.
This is why I put “entry level” in quotes just now. With Ferrari, it’s a relative term. 
The main point of the new Berlinetta is that it’s lighter (by 45 pounds), cleaner and quicker than the car it replaces, the 458 Italia. It also demonstrates the way in which increasingly stringent emissions restrictions have affected automakers in very real, very tangible ways. Its efficiency numbers set a new record for a street-legal production Ferrari. Engineers at Ferrari HQ in Maranello, Italy, eked out those ratings by shaving weight and resistance off the side intakes, the double front spoiler, and the sculpted flanks. There’s even an aerodynamic underbody.
Also new are the exhaust pipes (repositioned to make room for the new rear diffuser) and the circular LED taillights. 
Did I mention this car has 200 horsepower more than the iconic F40 and 230 more horsepower than something rather more pedestrian like, say, a Porsche 911 Carrera 4 GTS? (Are you catching my sarcasm?) 
Ferrari says it’s fit to use it as a “daily driver.” Consider it a relative term. 
 

=== Title: Meet 'White Girl Rosé,' the Wine-on-Demand From 'The Fat Jew' and 'White Girl Problems' - Bloomberg ===

“Last summer, in the Hamptons, there was a rosé shortage. People were running through the streets, screaming. There was not enough rosé. They were hoarding it in their arms … and we said, ‘never again!’”
That's when Instagram superstar Josh Ostrovsky (who you might know as 
,   or maybe just the King of Brunch. Or Whitney Jewston. Jewther Vandross?) says he got the idea for White Girl Rosé, a new wine label out this summer for $14.99 via Fresh Direct. 
Until now Ostrovsky has focused his energies on building his personal brand—amassing more than 4 million Instagram followers by doing such things as swimming in a lifesize bowl of Craftsman chili, helping the homeless get fit on Citi Bikes, and getting pedicures with Katie Couric. White Girl Rosé represents his first foray into consumer goods and, as such, is a major departure from the viral videos and stunts that made him his name. 
“I'm trying to go a little more off the URL and get a little more into the IRL,” Ostrovsky says. Translation: off the Internet and into real life.
To fulfill his desire to “make real things,” Ostrovsky is teaming up with another Internet star, David Oliver Cohen—aka Babe Walker of 
 on Twitter—to produce the northern-California bottled wine. Their first order rang up to 30,000 bottles of dry Sauvignon Blanc and Zinfandel blend. 
“Ultimately with our two brands, [we’re planning to] come together and figure out a way to have a real product people could buy and enjoy the fun they are having on social media and bring it to their actual party," says Cohen. “We want to be national by next summer, one year from now: 1 million bottles sold.” 
Now is the moment for rosé, once regarded as the ugly stepsister of both red and white wine. The pink wine has now surpassed red in popularity in France, that nation of Bordeaux and Burgundy, and in the U.S. last year, sales of expensive versions of the wine
. (Wine sales as a whole expanded only 1 percent) 
As for the name, the pair insists it’s not meant to offend.
“White Girl Problems is really more of a platform from which we can all stand and air our grievances. So you don't have to be a white person, or a girl, to have a white girl problem,” says Cohen. “It's really more about white people making fun of themselves, and everyone can make fun of themselves.”
Making fun of himself is something that comes naturally to Ostrovsky, who is known for his vertical ponytail (he calls it his “Jew Unicorn” hairdo) and his willingness to expose his expansive belly in humorous stunts. (It was put to good effect when he hosted a wet T-shirt contest for pregnant ladies in Tampa.) His particularly viral videos include one in which he invited “homeless” people in New York to participate in 
 on parked Citi Bikes, or when 
 in the backyard of a B-list Los Angeles celebrity, using migrant workers.  And the success of White Girl Rosé will be an early test of whether he can parlay his Fat Jew comedic persona into financial success. 
He's confident. “It's a state of mind,” says Ostrovsky. “You know, all guys, I think, have a little bit of white girl in them, and I think they should embrace it. And we embrace the 'bro-sé' movement [the increasing number of men drinking rosé]. If any bros want to chug rosé with us, we are down.
“We're like the Magellans of rosé, pioneering into new worlds. Also, here's the thing about it—it’s actually delicious.”

=== Title: Sommeliers Are Finally Working Together to Bring More Varied Wines to Diners - Bloomberg ===

Imagine a party at which all the guests are sommeliers: You might expect more spitting than at a Sex Pistols concert, more sniffing than at the home of a wayward lord.
Not quite.
Younger wine professionals in London have gotten together in an informal group called Wine Bantz, to which they each bring a bottle and try to surprise one another. While it's about blind tasting rather than getting blind drunk, it's certainly convivial. The first session, at 
 in Bethnal Green, lasted into the early hours. (You can see the evidence on the group's 
.)
Like policemen, sommeliers in London are getting younger. If you doubt that, please meet Seamus Sharkey, the head sommelier at 
. He is 24.
"Wine Bantz is creating a real buzz," he says. "We've been talking about doing this for months. Sommeliers are generally extroverts, but there's usually not much energy at wine tastings. You just show up and go back to work. This is about sharing and enjoying.
"We want to get people excited about the London wine scene. Some sommeliers think they are lone rangers conquering the world, but really it's our job to pour fermented grape juice."
The second Wine Bantz, held at 
 last month, was all about sparklers, with bottles that ranged from Dom Perignon 1970 to a little-known Austrian wine. ("Bantz" is short for "banter," or wine chatter.) Some guests ended up back at Mission, whose co-owner Michael Sager-Wilde, is a founder of Wine Bantz.
Sunaina Sethi, 27, who is in charge of wine at 
—which includes Bubbledogs and Gymkhana—says she plans to get involved. "It's a great opportunity for like-minded people to get together and talk about a common passion and taste interesting things," she says. "It's a way for sommeliers to find more interesting wines to introduce in their establishments."
Raphael Rodriguez, restaurant director at 
 at Claridge's, has been part of Wine Bantz from the start, when it was just a handful of friends. About 100 people are now on the e-mail list.
"The point is to get the wine trade together and have fun," he says. "We share the same passion, and the point is to get to know each other and get to know some different wines." That can work in diners' favor as unusual wines introduced at the events make their way onto wine lists in restaurants.
(If you can't wait for that and you want something funky, 
 in Shoreditch focuses on "Austrian wines with cool labels and crazy stories." These wines, from small growers, are just starting to show up in restaurants such as Lyle's. 
 in Mayfair is another fine destination for the adventurous.)
The Bubbledogs party, which attracted 30 to 40 guests, took place in early July. It's back to Mission in September for the next gathering.
"It was really fun," says James Snowdon, 27, who worked at Bubbledogs before joining 
. "It's just a bunch of friends of a similar age who are like-minded when it comes to wine. Some bring funky stuff and others big names."
Bubbledogs owner Sandia Chang, a veteran of 
 in New York and 
 at the Berkeley, says Wine Bantz is actually replacing an important part of the learning process for a restaurateur that gets lost when you break out on your own.
"When I was working at Per Se, I had sommeliers that would pull me aside at the end of the night and pour me a few glasses of wine, blind, and it would train me to taste them blind," she says. "But once you run your own restaurant, no one does that for you any more. This is a good way to train each other and show each other new things and see what people are drinking out there.
"We just talk a lot about geeky wine stuff and have fun and relax. Sommeliers used to be quite intimidating, but nowadays we're a little bit fresher-faced, with a new approach.
"Generally, restaurants no longer list wines by lowest to highest price. They list by regions and grapes because people are more savvy and more open to trying new things. It's more fun. There are a lot of women in the industry as well, which is less intimidating. Sommeliers are younger and talk normally, instead of using jargon."
What is her tip for something for us all to try?
"Cabernet franc is the thing now," she says. "It’s a grape that’s been forgotten and it is amazing. I always think cabernet franc tastes like the dry spice package in instant noodles."
Now that's language we can all understand.

=== Title: Adventures in Home Dehydrators: From Beef Jerky to Booze Dust - Bloomberg ===

The dehydrator has always been a provision maker, rewarding the do-aheads. This may explain why I’ve never wanted one, and why the most patient, proficient users of dehydrators tend to be trail cooks. To most of us it’s a toy, but the trail cook desiccates with purpose: to make food small, light, and durable so it can be transported and consumed efficiently, with low risk of spoilage.
My friend Logan, who works to repair broken trails in upstate New York, uses his little Nesco Snackmaster dehydrator about once a month to make different meals in bulk, like red curry (a dried paste built from scratch, to which he adds coconut cream powder and dehydrated precooked vegetables). I’ve always found this impressive, but I’d never considered adding a machine to my family of appliances—too big, too specialized.
Then I tasted a delicious salad at 
, in Manhattan.
The chef, Justin Smilie, is one of many using the machine to intensify flavors in restaurant dishes. He’d dusted the leaves with an umami-rich powder made from dehydrated anchovies so the dish had all the rich flavors of a classic Caesar, with none of the weight. (So good, we even 
 for home cooks.) Convinced, I called up Excalibur, a manufacturer based in Sacramento, and—
a shiny steel beast weighing about 20 pounds arrived at my apartment.
It was the height of mulberry season in New York, and the wild, wonky tree in my courtyard was full of berries. I arranged them in the perforated trays, turned the thing on, and waited. In about 12 hours they were tiny, nearly black, and still faintly chewy (ideal for smattering over yogurt for breakfast, mixing into granola, or baking into a cake).
Later, while my neighbors lit their grills, I stayed inside to slice flank steaks. I marinated the meat in soy sauce and black pepper and watched the pieces turn very, very slowly into sweet, tender jerky. I was pretty pleased with myself, but meat and fruit are the most basic of basics—Dehydrating 101. The process isn’t complicated, and of course it isn’t new: The sun was the proto-dehydrator, preserving things on and off the vine.
The electric dehydrator, which gained popularity in American home kitchens of the 1970s, hasn’t evolved much since then. It’s still a small, warm room that strips food—slowly and steadily—of all its moisture, like one endless sunny afternoon. A fan circulates air, to avoid the growth of mold and bacteria on the warm food, and as the moisture evaporates, some flavors concentrate. The colors often darken and deepen. The smells change and, in some cases, almost vanish.
The main difference between a $30 machine and a $300 one is material, looks, and quality of air circulation. The more luxurious models circulate air more evenly, so you don’t have to flip foods over in their trays, and they boast a more precisely accurate thermostat. Although you can accomplish many of the same things in a low-temperature oven, mine will not maintain temperature evenly, so I have to flip foods and rotate trays frequently. A microwave can dehydrate as well, and in a fraction of the time, though it can also heat aggressively.
In my borrowed dehydrator, I found success with black olives drained of their brine, ripe grapes, and sliced nectarines. I mashed some potatoes with Old Bay and spread them on parchment paper, thinking I could replicate reconstituted potato chips of some kind (nope, awful!). And the yogurt I’d mixed with honey turned powdery, not at all like the chewy candies I’d hoped for. I followed a “cookie” recipe I found on a raw food forum, using dates and sesame seeds, which was essentially a fancy fruit rollup. From the same forum, I learned it’s the perfect environment for sprouting mung beans (and other things you might want to sprout). 
If faintly warm drying doesn’t sound as fun as cooking, it’s because it isn’t. 
English has been experimenting with the process since 2011, which he’s written about on his website, 
.
English has since dehydrated dozens of spirits and liqueurs, and he’s found that some work better than others. “The downside to dehydrating liqueurs is you lose some of the aromatic properties,” English says. 
 
English has used it to make rock candy, along with Campari-flavored fruit leathers (by mixing it with applesauce and dehydrating it again) and nonalcoholic mixers.
Instead of returning the machine, I imagined a world in which I always have a dozen bottles of cold Champagne in the fridge, and my stock of sugar flavored with Chartreuse and Campari dust would come in super handy to make last-minute cocktails for all the friends who stop by unannounced. Never mind that this never happens, that the dehydrator barely fits in my apartment, that my fridge is mostly full of old condiments. I guess whether you’re making jerky or Angostura flavor pills, the dehydrator is a big, slow dream machine. You buy one so you can think ahead, and plan for some other day.

=== Title: Hakkasan and Wagamama Founder Alan Yau Thinks - Bloomberg ===

It's usually difficult to make a restaurant profitable. At luxurious, elegant 
, now open in London's upscale Mayfair, it must be a nightmare.
Restaurateur Alan Yau describes Park Chinois as the most expensive opening in Mayfair, where his neighbors include 
, 
 and 
., three of the city's most glitzy. He sees it as an entertainment venue rather than just a restaurant. Costs are generally believed to be just below £40 million ($57 million), include the cost of acquiring the site – almost 16,000 square feet (1,485 square meters) – which stretches from Berkeley Street to Dover Street. Yau says he spent "north of £1,000" a square foot getting the place ready.
Yau is ready for the challenge. He's the man behind 
, 
 and 
, all of which have gone on to become international brands. He also set up 
, a casual Thai chain with 12 locations in London.
Park Chinois is like a sumptuous lounge in 1920s Shanghai, where a band plays as guests sip cocktails or dine on luxury dishes. The menu includes Hokkaido sea cucumber, Australian abalone, and goose web (£85), and roast duck (£75), to which you may add 50 grams of Beluga Imperial Caviar for £280. (There are also starters below £20 and mains below £30 on the 
.)
Yau says he wanted to set up an entertainment restaurant, except that rather than the DJ-led lounge-style dining pioneered by the 
in Paris in 1996, this one has live music.
"I like the combination of dining to live music with a view of what happened in the past from the 1920s, from the 
 to the jazz bands in Shanghai," he says. "Park Chinois is a modern version."
Hong Kong-born Yau didn't take any chances before opening Park Chinois. In addition to a feng shui master, he says he employed eight to 10 "layers of different consultants".
"What I enjoy more is really what I call emotional architecture, meaning how to create a set of energy in relation to the project," Yau said. "That side is more than feng shui."
More prosaically, he says he's counting on average spending of about £120 per guest, compared with £80 to £90 for his Mayfair neighbors.
 
 
 
 
Yau serves lunch, afternoon tea and dinner in the Salon de Chine dining room, while downstairs is more of a nightclub. Once the bar is open – in the space that was formerly Automat restaurant on Dover Street – the venue will have three revenue streams. He plans late-night dinner-dances and regular concerts as he bids to put both music and food center stage.
"I hope music can be as important as food in a place like this," Yau says, adding that he wants to create a distinctive Park Chinois sound, "a combination of the old-school arrangements led by a diva vocalist."
The lineup of artists is unusual and varied. It includes a Russian harpist, 
, who made her debut at the age of nine at the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, and 
, a London-born singer-songwriter who spent much of her childhood in Turkey and Yemen. Samal doesn't always perform in such glamorous venues: she has 
 station.
 
 
 
 
He describes the Club Chinois sound as "Haiku Swing." His aim is to record and produce new versions of classics with contemporary vocalists, rather than follow Buddha Bar with compilation albums. Yau says he is in discussions about introducing a Park Chinois channel on Apple Inc.'s music service, as Burberry Group Plc 
.
He says that he has already received approaches about opening a Park Chinois in other cities, just as 
's owners, Abu Dhabi-based Tasameem Real Estate LLC, have done, even planning 
 in U.S. shopping malls. Yau says he wouldn't want to do that and would rather focus on music as the vehicle for international expansion.
"I think that commercially Park Chinois can sustain itself in London Mayfair," he says. "Beyond that, in terms of a business model, I don’t think that the old way in terms of opening 10, 50 Park Chinois around the globe is the way to develop.
"The ambition for me personally is really not to expand Park Chinois abroad, mainly because I think it is an oxymoron to have a fine-dining chain. However you do it, it is always going to be compromised. I just feel that music can travel better."

=== Title: Fortnum & Mason Hopes Bygone Era Can Feed Glamorous Future - Bloomberg ===

Fortnum & Mason, the posh London department store that traces its history to 1707, has closed its Fountain brasserie after 60 years and plans to replace it with a destination restaurant oozing the old-fashioned glamour of a bygone age.
The new 45 Jermyn St. will be open from 7 a.m. until late and will accommodate as many as 113 guests at tables, booths and a long bar. The menu will move through breakfast options such as buttermilk pancakes through Dover sole and other traditional dishes, to modern options such as vegetable carpaccio with tarragon salsa verde. There will also be a late-night supper menu.
“To be a great destination restaurant, to feed a metropolitan crowd with cosmopolitan tastes, you’ve got to be able to cater to everybody,” said director Simon Thompson, previously of 
and 
. “There has to be great hospitality, with professionalism and warmth.”
 was the ultimate dining destination when it opened in 1955. Guests from London and beyond converged to try the Knickerbocker glories and other sundaes from the first soda fountain in the U.K. It was the creation of Garfield Weston, the Canadian businessman who acquired Fortnum & Mason in 1951.
“It’s not an easy conversation to go to the grandchildren of Garfield Weston, the guy who bought that site, put the restaurant into the site, named the restaurant, bought the soda fountain and say, ‘Let’s change the name and start again,’ ” Thompson said. “But it was an instant unanimous yes.”
The new restaurant is scheduled to open in late October. Head chef Lee Streeton formerly worked at Brown’s Hotel, Daphne’s, Le Caprice and The Savoy. The designs are by 
, whose projects include the Ivy in London and Soho Beach House in Miami.
It will feature burnt-orange leather banquettes in the center, booths set against the front and back walls and a marble-fronted bar serving both classic and innovative cocktails. Thompson said there will be a focus on wine, with moderate prices that reflect Fortnum’s buying power and international connections.
The man behind the project is Ewan Venters, who took over three years ago as chief executive at 
, which is known as the Queen’s grocer. He came to prominence on the food scene in his former job as director of restaurants at Selfridges & Co.
It was Venters who persuaded chef 
 to come out of retirement in 2009 and open a temporary restaurant on the roof of that Oxford Street department store. That pop-up was supposed to last a few days but was extended three times after Selfridges said it received 10,000 calls and 8,000 e-mails seeking tables.
“Simon and I have been working on 45 Jermyn St. for three years,” Venters said.  “We are creating a destination in its own right. And the beauty of it is that it is one of the great restaurant locations in the West End. It’s a corner site on one of the most famous streets in London.
“The London restaurant scene has seen a lot of openings where everything has been pared back. There is a really interesting opportunity for 45 Jermyn St. to do the antithesis of that: Not stuffy, not overtly formal, but bringing back glamour.”

=== Title: Polo Bar Review: Ralph Lauren Corrals the Fashionable Herd - Bloomberg ===

At first you might admire a nice horse painting here and there, but then it starts to get a bit weird. The horse paintings are everywhere.
The Polo Bar, a famous-person magnet and restaurant next door to Ralph Lauren’s New York flagship store on Fifth Avenue, is almost 
 dedicated to its theme. After a while, as you sit on saddle leather, sipping a fine Moscow Mule bobbing with a tiny wooden polo mallet, it might seem as if you’ve been trapped, 
-style, in the dreams of a deranged billionaire equine fetishist.
But hey, it’s not so bad in here! After all, this is the house of fashion god Ralph—not his actual house in Bedford, N.Y., or his ranch in Colorado, or his beach getaway in Montauk, N.Y.—but the one you can pop round and visit in Midtown Manhattan, as long as you have a reservation. If you don’t have a reservation, you aren’t getting in, not even for a peek or a drink at the bar. A bouncer disguised as a friendly young host is guarding the entrance on 55th Street, crudely referring to a printed-out list of names before letting the lucky few through the doors.
Once through those doors, oh!
You are awash in golden, cognac-colored light. You will luxuriate in the stares of other diners (and they do stare) as they wonder who you are. After all, they know what 
had to go through to get in. The service is aggressively cheerful, and the entire staff is good looking and confident, as if they were all plucked from the malls of America when they were teenagers to sign international modeling contracts. How does their shiny hair not move, not even a whisper? How are their teeth so perfectly straight and white? You’ll be welcomed by them several times: outside the door, inside the door, at the upstairs host stand, at the downstairs host stand, and finally, at your table. It’s a little exhausting, but it’s good practice: Looking good and saying hello is half the point of the Polo Bar. 
On a recent evening, I saw Lauren himself ambling through the dining room in a pair of unexpectedly bright orange sneakers, belted jeans, and a tucked plaid shirt. He was heading toward his family in the back nook downstairs to join them for dinner. That’s when Christie Brinkley, who was there eating with her family, stood up in black leather pants to say hello. She kissed the designer's glowing, sun-tanned cheeks. All in the room were looking but doing their best to appear as if they were casually gazing at something else. You know, like that horse painting over there. No, not that one, the other one.
Henrik Lundqvist, the handsome Swedish goalie for the New York Rangers (who recently took a puck to the throat) was there on a different night, dining with his wife and two other extremely good-looking couples. The booth area hosted a group of fortysomething women with twinkling silver shoulder pads, leather Peter Pan collars, and straight blonde hair cut the same layered, just-past-the-shoulders length. They leaned on massive, green plaid pillows, clinked glasses of wine, glanced around, and whickered. Power couples on date nights with other power couples took up a good quarter of the dining room, many enjoying strip steaks with French fries.
Yes, there is food. The menu focuses on the comforts of unchanging American club fare and delivers it on branded bistro plates. Trends do not matter here, only the timeless elegance of the cheeseburger: tall, picture-perfect, and cut carefully in half if you want to split it. There’s no going off script with toppings and jams and aged meat—just a well-constructed, cooked-to-the-right-temperature burger. I found the patty a little dry and bloodless, but with servers so obsessed with keeping the tables clean and tidy, this almost seemed on purpose to avoid a mess.
Most of the best dishes at Polo Bar are no-brainers, like a pile of raw vegetables with ranch dressing, and a pale golden roast chicken with super smooth mashed potatoes that taste mostly of butter and salt. While these dishes are not exciting, they’re not bad, either. Diners at my table particularly enjoyed the miniature ceramic pot of “ranch house” chili with a sweet fast-food-soft biscuit, a messy, tasty little appetizer with layers of cheese and sour cream baked in like a seven-layer dip.
At some point, popovers became the aspirational, luxury lifestyle bread, and Polo Bar serves its popovers warm and covered in crisp cheese, with Ralph Lauren-branded butter. “Excuse me, but are you still enjoying your popover?” someone is bound to ask, if you leave any of it on your plate. Chances are, you won’t. The bread is tasty, crisp, and a little bit sweet, with a tender layer inside.
There’s a decent pecan pie, though it has an oddly bendy crust and a firm, almost fudgy sugar filling. The lovely brownie sundae is a much better dessert option, the brownie having all the good qualities of a well-made flourless chocolate cake.
One or two subpar things will come out of Polo Bar’s kitchen if you’re not careful, like the crab cakes. They are limp and wet beneath a ruffle of filo threads, served with a truly terrible bell pepper sauce. This tastes like someone liquidated a bunch of raw bell peppers in a very powerful blender and then poured it straight into the dish. 
This block on 55th Street was once the home of Le Pavillon, Henri Soulé’s famous French restaurant in New York, which defined the country’s taste in all things haute and Gallic throughout the 1940s and '50s. In 1957, the same year Ralph Lauren graduated from high school in the nearby Bronx, Le Pavillon was replaced with a second Soulé restaurant: La Côte Basque, a place so glamorous it became the stuff of legend.
It’s unclear what Soulé would have thought about the distinctly American style at the Polo Bar, but he might have been pleased to find Dover sole on this menu, well-seasoned and gently pan-fried, served with a little side of lemon-butter sauce. It may not be an homage, but it’s simple, chic, and better than you’d expect.
The Polo Bar is at 1 East 55th St. (Midtown); +1 212 207-8562 or ralphlauren.com
 

=== Title: Twelve Unusual Brews That Will Blow Up Your Summer BBQ - Bloomberg ===

With grilling season now upon us, it’s time for a refresher course on how to navigate the craft beer section of your local store. The most important tip to remember is that not everyone will agree on a single type of beer, especially if you are venturing into really specialized brews. So stock up on a mix of them, fire up some steaks, and watch as your guests’ eyes pop—these 12 suggestions will most assuredly impress.
This mead (honey-wine) is a crushable Arnold Palmer-inspired offering from Michigan’s 
. Brewed with black tea and lemon juice, it’s pleasantly sweet with a balancing acidity and tannic backbone. For something with strong flavor, it’s very thirst-quenching (and gluten-free).
This new bourbon-barrel-aged barleywine from Michigan’s 
 (part of its Planets Series) is a terrific choice for sharing with guests after the hedonism of grilling and gorging has finished and those digestive enzymes are hard at work. Open with—or as—dessert, as Saturn is a robust, strong ale packing big toffee notes with an oaky vanilla underpinning from the residual bourbon. A great introduction to the world of barrel-aged beers.
OK, if you don’t like cucumbers, scroll past this one. But, if you are indeed a fan of the green gourd, then this farmhouse beer from Florida’s 
 will delight you. An almost comically “summery” offering, it uses enough cucumbers during the brewing process to end up teeming with predictably bright green notes in the bottle. Citra hops keep things juicy, and keep the resulting brew from coming off as one-dimensional.
California’s 
is now in its fifth year of an ambitious barrel-aging program, which has consistently yielded worthwhile results. This year’s product is no exception, a golden pear wine aged in handpicked red wine casks. A whisper of honey lends an overall soft sweetness, and at 6.9 percent alcohol by volume, it’s a thrilling table beverage for guests uninterested in imbibing anything with gluten.
 is doing exciting things in Germany’s dogmatic brewing environment (land of the “
”). This unfiltered Kölsch-style beer is an accessible joy to drink. Clean and grassy, it is very lightly sweet with a crisp dry finish. The only issue here is that it’s perhaps a little 
 agreeable a beverage.
You know when someone says, “I only really like lagers”? Massachusetts’ 
 is here to help. Focusing solely on the bottom-fermenting world of lager brewing, it’s done more to elevate the style (which is often overlooked by the craft beer world) than just about any other U.S. producer. This, its flagship India Pale Lager, is a sessionable New England favorite. Big citrus notes, a bitterness that isn’t fatiguing, and flawless carbonation will keep you coming back for more.
Originally only available in Vermont, 
has a lineup that is already obsessively sought after by New England beer fanatics. In the past year, however, Connecticut’s 
has begun contract-brewing this aptly named double IPA of Lawson’s. Packaged in tallboy cans and available in both states, if you’re lucky enough to find some, do yourself a favor and stock up—it could very well be a watershed experience for you and your guests. Tropical fruits practically leap from the can when opened.
It’s hard to go wrong with any of 
’s hoppy offerings, really. This one in particular is an exceptionally bright, citrusy American Pale Ale that hits the right notes with every batch. Make sure if you locate some to check the bottling date on the side of the package, as its bouquet is best admired fresh.
 hit a home run with this recipe early on in its career, which it self-categorizes as an “Extra Special Pale Ale.” With big melon notes upfront and a strong grapefruit finish, it’s one of the more impressively hopped import choices on the market.
Gose is a mostly forgotten German style that uses salt and coriander in the brewing of a sour wheat beer with moderate alcohol. 
’s is a great example first brewed in 1824. A lemon tartness gives way to a savory cereal center, with a surprisingly soft finish. Beyond easy to drink, it almost seems to evaporate in the glass before you know it.
Pilsners are a perfect fit for times when drinking a complex beverage seems almost cumbersome. Germany’s 
 founded in 1791, brews one of the most classic examples of the style. Healthily hopped with only a negligible bitterness, it is lightly sweet, then decidedly dry. This is one brew that won’t weigh you or your guests down too terribly.
Maryland brewer 
’s so-called Post-Prohibition Style ale has become what its name heralds: a cult 
. It’d be hard to fathom a beer drinker who wouldn’t want to double-fist this Belgian-inspired delight. Peppery, piney, and fruity, it has a terrifically zippy carbonation throughout.
This Helles Lager from Minnesota is, truth be told, heavenly. Midwesterners in 
s distribution network should stock up on this one for those who gravitate toward the crisp, lighter end of the suds spectrum. Bready and floral, it’s exceedingly balanced throughout.

=== Title: Top 10 Restaurants and Bars for Dining in London’s Shoreditch - Bloomberg ===

East London is drawing chefs like a superconducting magnet.
They are following the creatives and other young professionals who have moved to the area, which is also home to Silicon Roundabout—the U.K. hub for Web businesses.
Shoreditch is at the center of all this. There are many fine bars and restaurants among the design studios. My favorite places for food are Clove Club and Lyle's, plus Rochelle Canteen with its simple dishes, low prices, and shared tables.
If you meet anyone really hip, they may tell you it's over and that the in crowd has moved farther east, to Hackney. People have been writing off Shoreditch almost since the formerly working-class district became fashionable in the late 1990s. But it's still got a pulse (which is more than you can say for some of the crime victims along Hackney's Murder Mile). And it's still got great restaurants.
Here are 10 to try, from a tiny basement speakeasy to establishments with innovative chefs and even a Michelin star.
Hoxton Square is the historic center of the Shoreditch scene. It can feel a bit too much sometimes: How many beards can you fit into a square? Where flamboyance rules, this small restaurant is understated, with minimalist décor and a menu that avoids frippery to focus on a few ingredients. The dishes change daily and may include crumbed artichoke with lentils, ricotta, dandelion, and pine nuts at 16 pounds ($23.70); or sea bream, chili, coriander, and spiced yogurt (17 pounds). My favorites are the all-day snacks, such as gorgonzola custard, duck rillettes, and Padron peppers. Walk-ins are accommodated at a communal table and there is also outdoor seating. 
This Vietnamese cafe is among the finest in London—and with better food than you will find in fancier restaurants. Hanoi-born Hieu Trung Bui (who also owns Viet Grill and Keu) uses some British ingredients to re-create the dishes of his homeland, eschewing the Chinese cuisine that often makes its way onto U.K. menus. Dishes to try include La Vong grilled monkfish, which is prepared at your table with galangal, turmeric, and dill. It is light and very fresh. The mighty marbled "shaking beef" (with cubed rump barrel steak, watercress, and red onion) shows off the quality of the meat. 
This brand-new Peruvian restaurant is the third from Martin Morales, who also owns Ceviche in Soho and Andina in Shoreditch. It's housed in an historic building that was commissioned in 1898 by the philanthropist Thomas Lipton (of Lipton's Tea) as a place for the working class of East London to gather and eat in comfort. The room is beautiful, with a long bar on one side. The menu includes dishes from Chifa (Peruvian-Chinese) and Nikkei (Peruvian-Japanese) gastronomy alongside Afro-Peruvian BBQ dishes and classics. The quinoa burger (8 pounds) features kiwi yogurt, amarillo chili mayo, and lettuce in a soft bun. 
If you are going for one gourmet meal in Shoreditch, this is the place, closely followed by Lyle's. Chef Isaac McHale has already won one Michelin star and he might be looking at a second if he keeps up the standard. He uses a few ingredients to create dishes with clean, distinctive flavors. Try the flame-grilled mackerel sashimi with watercress and English mustard, for example. But the word is out: The place is so packed at night that 
 where you pay in advance. The three-course set lunch at 35 pounds is a great introduction, plus you can usually walk in and try it. 
This Indian restaurant and bar is beautifully designed in the 
, and the service is friendly. Best of all, the food is inexpensive and just full of flavor. I always order the Ruby Murray curry, though the lamb raan bun takes some beating: It is packed with spicy flavor. The cocktails aren't bad either, while the breakfasts are among the best in London. I keep going back. 
. 
Some waiters in Shoreditch can be a bit too cool for school. There's none of that nonsense at this speakeasy-style basement bar. You get a warm welcome, and original cocktails such as the Tokyo Collins, with Beefeater gin, yuzu sake, lemon, and grapefruit with soda. (I tried to leave my credit card behind the bar and the barman said he'd just chase me down if I ran away.) Try to book because the place gets crowded and there's one rule: No one is allowed to stand so that everyone can have a little space.
Lyle's is another 
 in the style of Clove Club, which is no surprise as chef James Lowe was a member of the Young Turks chef collective with Isaac McHale. The food is unfussy but not without ambition. The kitchen is on one side of the room and the bar the other. Starters such as bloodcake with burnt apple and celeriac (6.70 pounds) show Lowe's understanding of flavors. There are also some unusual wines. The dinner tasting menu costs 39 pounds. The prices are low for this quality of cooking. 
. 
This British restaurant in a former Victorian warehouse serves much better food than you might expect for such a large space and such a long reputation as a hipster hangout. Neil Borthwick is a low-key chef who produces dishes that appear simple only because he has put so much thought into them. (He's the partner of chef Angela Hartnett.) I can't go without ordering the deep-fried oysters (3 pounds each), but a kid-goat special was one of the best things I've eaten this year, with its deep flavor. The set lunch is 16 pounds for two courses. 
This is one restaurant you are highly unlikely to stumble across. It's housed behind a locked door in a former bike shed on the grounds of a Victorian school. Rochelle is the creation of two women: Melanie Arnold and Margot Henderson (wife of St. John chef Fergus Henderson). You share tables and eat dishes that have the simplicity of home cooking, only with more skill and better ingredients. Mains include crab cakes, watercress, and aioli (16 pounds). No booze is served but you can bring your own wine for a 5-pound corkage fee. Rochelle Canteen is open for breakfast, lunch, and afternoon tea. 
I've snuck Tramshed in at the end more for the fun factor than the food. The restaurant is housed in a huge old tramshed. The room is dominated by a gigantic formaldehyde sculpture of a cow and a cock by Damien Hirst, a friend of chef-owner Mark Hix. The place is buzzy and visually exciting. The menu focuses on chicken and steak. Tramshed has only been open for about three years but it's fair to call it a Shoreditch institution, and one that's good to visit on a night out with friends.

=== Title: Jason Atherton's New London Restaurant Sosharu Opens March 7 - Bloomberg ===

The head chef at a new Japanese 
 that promises to be one of London's highest-profile restaurants trained as a mechanical engineer in central Romania. Then he learned British cuisine in a Newcastle pub.
Alex Craciun is now the man picked by 
to head the kitchen at 
 , which opens in London's Clerkenwell on March 7.
It's a big job. Atherton is a respected chef who has just added a restaurant in Sydney to an international dining empire that now encompasses New York, Dubai, Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong. His current five London restaurants include 
 and 
. Sosharu will be the sixth, and there are plans for a seventh.
While Atherton has been in the industry's elite for at least 15 years, Craciun  started at the bottom, helping out in kitchens in Romania while he picked up skills. About a decade ago he moved from the city of Brașov to Newcastle, some 300 miles (480 kilometers) north of London.
"It was terrible," 30-year-old Craciun says with a laugh. "It was a mess,  and I didn't speak the language, or at least didn't really understand it. Though I did my best, it was really hard. But they promoted me. After five months I was in charge of the kitchen.
"Being new in the country gives you that motivation and you want to work more, and that is how everything started. If I had gone somewhere else, like a Michelin-star restaurant, it would have been totally different because I'd have been just pushed back and scared. But I knew I could do better food than them, and it gave me confidence."
Craciun first discovered Japanese flavors at Maze, where Atherton served an eclectic menu of tapas-sized dishes that incorporated Asian ingredients.
"That was quite special for me," Craciun says. "I was working in Maze for about three years and then decided: That's it. I'm going to work in Japan and see what's happening there."
He talked his way into kitchens in Tokyo and Osaka, which would have been difficult even if he spoke Japanese (he's now studying the language). At the famous 
, he simply turned up and stood outside the door, returning each day until he was allowed to enter the kitchen.
This was the first of several visits to Japan, where he worked anywhere he could, from a mom-and-pop noodle shop through to three-Michelin-starred temples of gastronomy. Atherton has been a mentor throughout.
To prepare for Sosharu, Craciun moved to Japan and spent a year at the Kyoto Culinary School. He worked at 
 in Kyoto under Chef Yoshihiro Murata, as well as at RyuGin, under Seiji Yamamoto, in Tokyo and Hong Kong.
Sosharu is located on the ground floor of the new Turnmill Building, with a 40-cover cocktail bar Seven Tales in the basement. The style is that of an izakaya, a casual restaurant similar to a pub, with the focus on flavor over sophistication. Dishes range from £6 ($8.40) to £26, and dinner is likely to run anywhere from £40 to £60 per person, before drinks. I haven't yet tried the food.
The menu will feature small plates, using Japanese and British ingredients, with sections dedicated to different specialties such as tempura, sashimi and hibachi grill. There will be no sushi.
Dishes are likely to include chashu pork belly with udon and king oyster; bream sashimi with shichimi and crispy potato; scallop with yuzu butter and fresh nori; and sukiyaki wagyu beef with glass noodles and young leeks. Desserts include apple pie with miso butterscotch; and white sesame chocolate with miso caramel. Cocktails will include Munenori's Mojito, made with cold-brewed matcha, nigori, Cuban rum, tonka bean and absinthe.
Exciting stuff, but does Craciun get homesick?
"When I left home, I said I am going away for one year," he says. Nine years later, "I miss my mum and dad, my brother, my family, and I try to go very year to see them at Christmas time. But I don't want to move back."

=== Title: Sex and the Sommelier: Make Way for Women - Bloomberg ===

When Élyse Lambert ascended to the rank of master sommelier at a ceremony last May in Aspen, Colo., the first thing she did was pop the cork on a bottle of Krug Grande Cuvée champagne. 
She had a lot to celebrate.  A wine consultant to Montreal’s Maison Boulud, she was one of 63 candidates who took the tough final master sommelier exam this year, the last step in a long, grueling, four-part process.  
Of the mere seven who passed, she was one of just two women. 
“There were very few female somms when I started out 15 years ago,” Lambert says.  “I began as a waitress. An MS after my name is important to me—and it helps change the image of women and wine in the restaurant world.” 
In this enlightened era, only 32 of the world’s 229 master sommeliers—that's just under 14 percent—are women. Canada has two. Three-quarters of them ply their trade in the U.S. 
“The sommelier profession has historically been a male-dominated industry,” admits Andrew McNamara, chairman of the Court of Master Sommeliers in the Americas. But it’s evolving. The venerable somm stereotype of a snooty, balding French guy with a silver tastevin hanging from a chain around his neck is thankfully long gone. 
In 2009, when Kelli White (now at Napa Valley’s Press restaurant) took a job at New York’s Veritas, the wine-centric restaurant had never had a female sommelier. Heidi Turzyn managed to work her way up to becoming the first female wine director at Gotham Bar & Grill only two years ago. But in an era when male sommeliers are likely to sport tattoos and sabre off the tops of Champagne bottles with bravado, women somms in some places still face an innate bias. 
 “I was once passed over for a sommelier job because the restaurant worried that I wouldn’t be able to carry cases of wine up and down stairs,” says Shelley Lindgren, wine director and owner of San Francisco’s A16, which won a 2015 James Beard Award for outstanding wine program. Let's invoke a stereotype to counter that assumption: A case of wine weighs about 40 pounds, the same as a small child.
Indeed, overcoming (often ignoring) old-fashioned sexism is the biggest obstacle cited. Many of the dozen female somms I interviewed have stories of customers who demanded “the real wine guy,” or made “who’s the chick?” remarks. 
“I still get the occasional guest, usually a male sexagenarian or older, who arches his brow in surprise or skepticism when I approach the table,” says Texan June Rodil. She chose the sommelier route over law school and was the other woman to pass the MS exam this year.
Being taken seriously was an issue, and still is, in some cities and countries. Pioneer Madeline Triffon oversees wine for Plum Market in Detroit and was the first American woman to be awarded the MS in 1987: “The credential has been a boon in my career—it opened doors and continues to do so.” Similarly, after becoming an MS, Emily Wines, now senior director of national beverage programs for the Kimpton Hotel Group, was offered the corporate wine director job she had been trying to create. 
At the end of the day, these women somms say, your work ethic is what counts.
French-born Pascaline Lepeltier, another MS and wine director at Manhattan restaurant Rouge Tomate, laments that she sees some women go awry by playing a "seduction card" to get ahead: “This fragilizes tremendously what a lot of women are trying to acquire—the respect.” 
Wines explains, “When young women come to me complaining that the boys’ club aspect of our industry is holding them back, I say you can’t make excuses.” 
None of these issues are surprising when you consider that the restaurant business was once mostly closed to women. Most chefs are still men, and the gender gap persists in the greater wine world. Men own the vast majority of the world’s great châteaux, and a recent study showed that only 10 percent of wineries in California have a woman as the head winemaker. 
The biggest barrier to success long-term, of course, is the same lean-in struggle most working women face: motherhood. It's, as Lepeltier says, 
Yet in the past few years, the number of women sommeliers has skyrocketed, especially in major urban centers such as New York City. “It’s one of the best cities to be a female somm at the moment,” insists Laura Maniec, co-founder of Manhattan’s Corkbuzz, who became a master sommelier in 2009. 
In London, the 2013 young sommelier of the year was a woman, and in Australia, where 90 percent of the sommeliers in 35,000 restaurants in the Restaurant & Catering Association were men a decade ago, three of Sydney’s powerhouse restaurants have female somms.  “Unfortunately,” says Lepeltier, “France is still very chauvinistic.”
But these women also believe they offer advantages, especially when it comes to service.
"Men are sometimes in a state of shock when I tell them I am the wine director," says Marika Vida of the Ritz-Carlton in New York. "Ultimately, I think they find it alluring. Women guests think it’s very cool—we’re helping the sisterhood.”
“I would say women tend to be more empathetic and are better at reading body language and might be perceived as less intimidating,” explains Maniec.  
Lee Campbell, the wine director at Brooklyn’s Reynard, puts it this way: “For me it’s more about nurturing, providing diners with an experience and unique stories. The male psyche is all about owning, commodifying, and measuring wines. In my early days, at Nick & Toni’s in Easthampton, a hangout for barons of industry, I had to be able to talk about how much the wine was worth. It was like learning to play golf."

=== Title: Five Best New Burgers in New York City - Bloomberg ===

Every restaurant in New York seems to have a burger on the menu right now, but which ones deserve your time? I’ve picked out some favorites this summer, from minimalist cheeseburgers (no tomato, no nothing) to extravagant, avocado-topped beasts. Here are five new offerings you should really get to know:
There’s something a little ridiculous about the burger at 
, which is unapologetically over-the-top, spiked with a tiny Californian flag, stuffed with shredded lettuce and bright red peppadew peppers, and—what’s that, sliced avocado? Yes. Also, there are 
 patties here, made with flavorful grass-fed beef but still quite juicy, and stuck together with cheddar. It’s not trying to be a classic take on the cheeseburger, but it's an excellent, complete lunch ($20). 
 
Even those strongly opposed to brioche buns can’t argue with the deliciousness of the burger at Church Street Tavern. You’ll forgive the presence of suspiciously fancy salad greens when you taste the well-seasoned, dry-aged meat, beefy with rib-eye and fatty wagyu, under a little cheddar and so much properly tart onion-bacon jam ($19). It’s a cheffy burger, for sure, but it’s also quite enormous and presented without fuss in a dim, cool dining room where you’re likely to get a table without jumping through any hoops. 
 
The burger looks squishy and uncomplicated, as if it came from a diner, but this is chef Wylie Dufresne's Alder, where things aren’t always what they seem. The meat is ground in-house: a mix of brisket and chuck brought together with dry-aged beef fat and Japanese salted kelp, which you may not notice but work to season and complicate the meat. It arrives on a big Martin’s potato roll, which may be one of the finest vehicles in existence for a beef patty, with an even layer of beer cheese. The best way to order it is at the bar and “all in,” which means you’ll also get a side of sweet, impossibly crunchy fried onions rings covered with a thin layer of gruyere, along with a cold beer ($21). 
 
When you get right down to it, what makes a cheeseburger? A bun, a patty, a slice of cheese. That’s all. And that’s what you get at Rose’s Bar and Grill: a perfect, minimalist cheeseburger ($15) in which each component is essential and brought together with care. The bread is very soft and covered in sesame seeds, the patty is caramelized and generously seasoned, and the cheese is sharp and sticky. The fries are glorious as well: thick, dark-edged, and crisp, with tender, steam-releasing centers. 
 
There are only about 25 burgers a night for sale at Emily, a fantastic little pizzeria in Brooklyn, and you want to make sure to get one: The thick and funky dry-aged patties are draped with cheddar and drip with a sweet and spicy Korean 
-spiked mayonnaise amplified with garlic butter that has melted a little in the heat ($19). The bread is a pretzel bun, fresh and surprisingly tender but still dense enough to soak up the extra sauce without going soggy. It’s messy business, this burger, and you’ll probably get a black sesame seed caught in your teeth, plus a spot on your T-shirt. It’s so good, you won't care. 

=== Title: Barrafina Tapas Topples Gymkhana as U.K. Restaurant of the Year - Bloomberg ===

, a new tapas bar in London’s 
, was named U.K. National Restaurant of the Year, toppling 
 winner

Chef Nieves Barragan’s Barrafina Adelaide Street, which opened last year, is the second outpost of Barrafina. The Soho original placed 47th in 2014. A third site is scheduled to open in Drury Lane in coming weeks. Barrafina is owned by brothers Sam and Eddie Hart, who also own Quo Vadis in Soho.
Barragan is the first woman chef to win restaurant of the year, and Barrafina Adelaide Street is the first no-reservations venue to win. London establishments make up 49 percent of the list. The awards are organized by 
 magazine.
The One to Watch award went to 
, in London’s Spitalfields. Last year’s One to Watch, 
, came sixth this year. Nathan Outlaw was named best chef, and the wine list trophy was awarded to the Square, in Mayfair.
The awards are based on the votes of 150 industry experts, including chefs, restaurateurs, food writers, and critics. (I am one of the voters.) The results were announced at the Hurlingham Club, in London.
 

=== Title: Is London’s Ivy Restaurant Any Good, After Its Splashy Reopening? - Bloomberg ===

You might say that 
 had lost its crown as London's most fashionable restaurant long before it closed in January 
.
Or, if you were being more brutal, you could say the owners damaged that crown and are now restoring it to its glory. First, Caprice Holdings Ltd. borrowed the jewels to create the 
, and mixed the gold with lesser metals to open the 
 and the 
. Now, a rigorous physical overhaul of the original restaurant seeks to re-create the regal old magic.
And it's worked. This Covent Garden institution—which traces its history to 1917—is back with a vengeance. After being closed for almost five months, not only does it have a 
, but more important, the food and the service are a match.
Executive Chef Gary Lee is an Ivy veteran, yet there is the kind of freshness and energy to the food coming out of his kitchen that you would normally associate with a newcomer making his mark.
The menu has always been eclectic, with British classics such as grilled Dover sole served alongside international cuisine. The Asian dishes are particularly good, with options such as yellowfin tuna and salmon sashimi.
A starter of bo la lot features ground beef formed into loosely textured mini-sausages and wrapped in wild-pepper leaves. It's served with nuoc cham, a Vietnamese dipping sauce with a hint of sourness that brings out the spicing in the beef, rather than swamp it on, unlike boring old sweet chili.
My favorite starter is the bang bang chicken. The smoked meat is served in a peanut butter and chili sauce on a bed of shredded carrots, onions, and cucumber. This cold dish is like comfort food with a twist: The sweet and nutty flavor is cut through with vinegar, while the vegetables add freshness and crunch.
But it's the classic shepherd's pie that most impresses. This is quite an achievement as the dish has been around forever and costs only 15.75 pounds ($24.90)—not bad for a main in London.
Minced beef and lamb are fried with mushrooms, carrots, and tomatoes, and seasoned with thyme and oregano plus Worcestershire sauce and red wine. This meaty concoction is then topped with mashed potatoes and baked for 30 minutes.
The potato has a crispy surface and a pillowy center, while the sauce is rich and deep as the pockets of a dot-com billionaire. Best of all, the meat dissolves on your tongue. Just when you think you might be in for a bit of a chew, you realize you are consuming gourmet baby food. It's as comforting as a cuddle.
Other highlights include crispy duck salad (10 pounds), which comes with watermelon and spicy cashews. It feels fresh and healthy yet packs a flavor punch. The main of deep-fried haddock with mushy peas and chips (16.50 pounds) has batter as light and crispy as tempura and fish that is soft and moist. 
Chicken masala (15.75 pounds) is perfectly seasoned. It has a sultry heat that nibbles at your taste buds without biting.
For desserts, go no further than the knickerbocker glory, a traditional over-the-top British sundae with layers of ice cream and fruit. Or the Pimm's royale jelly, with strawberry granite. It's an English summer in a glass—Wimbledon, Glyndebourne, Royal Ascot, Henley—only without the rain.
The main disappointment is the Ivy hamburger (14.50 pounds). Traditionally, this has been one of the finest in London, laden with fat for flavor. This time round, it tastes fine and has color, but there's been a juice bypass, which leaves it chewy.
There are a couple of wines to watch out for. Among the whites, Assyrtiko, Hatzidakis Santorini 2014 is light and crisp, with a little slice of pineapple fruitiness lurking at the back. (It's 10.50 pounds a glass and 22 pounds for a carafe.) 
The Syrah Tandem, Alain Graillot Morocco 2010 (48 pounds) is smoky and spicy yet subtle, with layers of flavor.
The room, by 
, looks better than ever. The central, triangular bar is a fine place to sip a martini. The prices are affordable and the service is as polished as the wooden floor.
The menu is filled with things you want to eat. And, having eaten them, I'll be happy to order them another time. (Well, I might give the burger a miss.)
I'm finding it hard to think of much that is wrong with the place. But never fear: I'm going to keep going back until I discover something. That may take some time.

=== Title: The 30 Best Restaurants in London Right Now, as Chosen by Top Chefs - Bloomberg ===

Chefs dine out more than most of us, and they all have favorite restaurants (beyond their own). But where are they eating now? Which establishments have they enjoyed recently and which dishes did they like most?
I asked the cream of London's culinary talent, and discovered that Clove Club, Lyle's, and Portland were among the most popular current restaurants. Here's what the chefs had to say:

)
Recommended by Jason Atherton (
).
Chef Ollie Dabbous serves up original and inventive dishes in this European restaurant in Fitzrovia. "I only went to see what it was like but I was blown away," Atherton says. "The duck-fat noodles was one of the best dishes I've had for years in London." (
)
Recommended by April Bloomfield (
, New York), Claude Bosi (
), Pierre Koffmann (
), and Lee Wescott (The Typing Room).
This modern British restaurant in Shoreditch is a favorite among chefs and the food crowd. Chef James Lowe is known for his spare, inventive dishes. "I had one of my favorite meals there last year," Bloomfield says. "It's simple, it's clean, it's thoughtful, it's precise. I'm all about Lyle's now." Chef Bosi agrees. "It is very good, simple, delicious cooking," he says. "The environment is quite minimalist, but that just makes you concentrate even more on the food. The cod tongue with wild garlic mash and ramson is a very good dish." Chef Koffmann is another regular diner, as is Westcott of the Typing Room. "I love it," Westcott says. "It’s an honest, unfussy homage to traditional British cuisine. The Dexter topside (cured meat) is delicious. The fact it is made in-house makes it even better. The smoked eel broth and turnips dish is also very good." (

Recommended by Tom Aikens (

This East London restaurant, from chef Lee Westcott, serves modern European cuisine. It's also part-owned by Jason Atherton, the British chef who has just opened the Clocktower in New York. "It's very clean food and Lee is a great talent," Aikens says. "He has a good understanding of ingredients and flavors. I recently had the halibut, with white asparagus, curry, and pine. It's really clean and fresh." (
)
Recommended by Amandine Chaignot (
) and Kim Woodward (
).
Blumenthal's luxurious brasserie at the Mandarin Oriental hotel serves historical British dishes, rather than the chef's unusual concoctions at the Fat Duck. "It's amazing," Chaignot says. "I especially loved the meat fruit." Woodward of Savoy Grill is another fan: "I was really impressed with the food and service, the whole experience. The octopus starter was amazing." (
)
Recommended by Cary Docherty (
):
This flagship of the television chef holds three Michelin stars and is run by chef Clare Smyth, who is widely admired for her seasonal cooking. "Clare's cooking is immensely enjoyable, and supremely confident," Docherty says. "It's a very inspiring place for me. My favorite dish is the sautéed foie gras with roasted veal sweetbreads, carrots, almonds, and cabernet sauvignon vinegar." (
)
Recommended by Helene Darroze (
).
Chef Isaac McHale's modern European restaurant in East London is one of the most feted establishments in the City. It quickly won a Michelin star and might be in line for a second. "In one year I went there three times," Darroze says. "What's on the plate is simple but in a very creative way. I like the black pudding best." (

This unassuming restaurant in London's Fitzrovia has quickly become a hit, especially with chefs. The décor is simple, and the seasonal dishes are simple and reasonably priced. "It's an extension of the bistronomy movement in London, which Arbutus helped to start," Demetre says. "It is food that people want to eat. This is the emerging talent, a new generation." Veteran French chef Koffmann is another fan. "I go there often," he says. "I love the snacks like the pig's head croquettes." Chef Puolakka of Company of Cooks concurs: "The food is simple but there is a lot of technical ability behind it. The boys are doing something different. I like the pig's head croquette." Tish of Salt Yard says, "My favorite dish of late was the charred brassicas with egg yolk, soy, and truffle. So simple but all the flavors marrying very well indeed and a really light touch." (

=== Title: Swedish Lawyer-Turned-Chef Will Abandon Menus at Top London Restaurant - Bloomberg ===

A former amateur cook who is now one of London's most respected chefs plans to close his restaurant temporarily to cut the number of seats by half. And then reopen without menus.
Mikael Jonsson, 48, who was a lawyer and entrepreneur in Sweden and France before opening 
 in Chiswick four years ago, says the aim is to be more creative and to serve each table with individual dishes based on the produce he receives that day.
"Reducing the number of covers, for me, is the only way to take the food to another level," the Swedish chef said in an interview. "We are a busy restaurant and when we are completely packed, we can send out as many as 400 plates during an evening.
"We want to be able to push forward with all the ideas we've got in embryo. People will just tell us how much they want to spend, and two tables sitting beside each other who want to spend the same amount of money might get two completely different meals."
Hedone will close on Oct. 10 for the refurbishment, which will reduce the number of seats to 18 in the dining room and four on stools overlooking the kitchen, from the current total of about 40. The restaurant is scheduled to reopen Oct. 21.
Jonsson's story is remarkable. Born in Olofstroem, in southern Sweden, he was passionate about food as a child and gained work experience in restaurants. But allergies meant he was unable to handle food, so he abandoned his dream of becoming a chef.
He studied engineering and then went to law school at the 
while also completing a business degree in Gothenburg. He says he did his military service at the same time, before joining the law firm Mannheimer Swartling. He and his friend then went on to start their own law firm.
He then became involved in Internet projects in the late 1990s and lived outside Nice, and briefly in Monaco. He put himself on a Paleolithic diet -- focussing on meat and eschewing dairy -- because his weight was ballooning and says he lost 28 kilograms in seven months. His allergies also disappeared.
"Parallel with everything I'd been doing, I've had this extreme obsession with food," he said. "Ever since I was very young I really wanted to cook for a living but I couldn’t do it because of allergies. And then I realized that suddenly I could do it."
Although he'd received no formal training and had never worked professionally in a kitchen, Hedone received rave reviews when it opened in 2011 and was awarded a Michelin star after just 14 months. It's placed at 60 in the Top 100 list issued by the 
awards.
After Hedone reopens, dinner will be served from Tuesday through Saturday and lunch on Saturdays only. There will be two prices of set menu only. Jonsson said he hasn’t decided on prices, but they are unlikely to be significantly higher than the present top options of 95 pounds ($147) and 125 pounds.
"There won't be too many courses because you very quickly lose interest if a menu is too long," he said. "But doing fewer covers will enable us to do more refined things."
Other restaurants, including Eleven Madison Park, in New York, have reduced the number of diners and won more Michelin stars. Jonsson denied that's a consideration.
"My personal goal is to see if I can find a style of food that is mine, and it doesn’t have to do with accolades," he said.

=== Title: Bangkok Restaurateur Bringing Chinese Hot Pot to London’s Soho - Bloomberg ===

A Bangkok restaurateur says he has spotted a gap in the London restaurant market and plans to open a specialist Chinese hot-pot restaurant on a prominent site in 
.
Shuang Shuang, on the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Wardour Street, will serve five different broths from across China. Diners will choose from about 50 ingredients — including sea bass, pumpkin slices and pork — from a conveyor belt.
“When I was at high school in Bangkok, my friends and I would always to for hot pot to celebrate,” says Fah Sundravorakul, who ran restaurants in Thailand before moving to London 18 months ago. “It's about having fun, interacting and trying things.
“When I came to London, I was always amazed by the number of people standing outside 
, talking and chit-chatting. It really struck me: That doesn’t happen anywhere in the world. It was when I saw that, that I felt hot pot would work here.”
Shuang Shuang will cater for vegetarians with two broths: Monk’s (soy milk, turnips and mushrooms) and Mala (Sichuan peppercorns and dried chili.) The others are Bird Berry (black-fleshed chicken and dried berries); Lamb Tonic (lamb bones and pickled cabbage); and Herbal River (prawn heads and fresh lemongrass.)
“Hot pot is the only cuisine that has been shared in all the major food cultures in Asia: China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, Mongolia, Singapore. Everyone has their own version. That’s why it’s so popular. Wherever you go, people love it.
“London has changed a lot over 10 years and has now become the food capital of the world,” he says. Some people say New York but I find people here are more open and the 
 is more authentic, even though you have many varieties.”
Shuang Shuang, which is scheduled to open over two floors in November, won’t accept reservations. The ground floor will be informal and reminiscent of hot-pot restaurants in Asia, while upstairs will be a little more serene.
Sundravorakul studied in Bangkok and Connecticut before graduating in economics from the University of Oregon. He says he expects diners to spend 20 pounds ($21) to 30 pounds on food, including snacks and desserts. Bao, a 
 that opened nearby about four months ago, frequently has people lined up outside waiting for a table.
Sundravorakul's Bangkok restaurants included Imperial Duck, Boon Tong Kee and Yamagoya. He previously worked for Diageo, leading the Johnnie Walker team in Thailand. 

=== Title: Scott Collins of MeatLiquor On London's Poshest Burgers - Bloomberg ===

Scott Collins is a rock 'n roll restaurateur. His arms are covered in tattoos; his restaurants rattle with loud music as young diners get messy washing down Dead Hippie burgers with Picklebacks and Mexican Dibdabs.
"No reservations" refers to the style of Collins and his business partner Yianni Papoutsis as much as to the bookings policy at 
, their London-based burger chain, whose current expansion plans include a second outlet in Singapore.
So what will Collins make of London's poshest burgers, costing as much as 38 pounds ($60), plus an extra 6 pounds for fries? Collins, who describes himself as an unrest-aurateur, agreed to brave the daylight, tuck in fine linen napkins and even consider using a knife and fork to put three of them to the test.
Here's how he ranked them.
This Mayfair restaurant's flagship is 
: Heart of wagyu rib-eye, seared foie gras and truffle mayo on foie-gras buttered brioche. Throw in a serving of fries (with "truffle dust") and you are looking at 44 pounds.
That compares with a total of 13 pounds for one of my London favorites, the 
 at 
.The meat in The Sackville comes sliced rather than as a patty, which surprises Collins, though he's less disapproving than I expect. "It's not technically a burger: It's an uptown roast beef sandwich," he says. "But I'm all for surprises. I'm not precious.
"It's not the easiest to eat but it's fine meat and I'm a fan of foie gras. The bun's not holding up terribly well. It's a two-napkin job. It’s a great piece of wagyu. It would be a crime to have to eat a burger with a knife and fork. This has quite an unusual structure. The fries are rubbish.
"It loses points for billing itself as a burger when it's not, and the price is prohibitive."
Australian wagyu/Black Angus beef burger, Ogleshield Cheddar, shallot-jalapeno marmalade, garlic aioli.
Chef David McIntyre has put so much thought into 
, you could almost write a book on it: The way the meat is cut, how the patty is made, the seasoning, the bun. I spent two mornings in the kitchen watching him do it and would go back for a third if I got a burger at the end of it.
McIntyre uses a quarter-inch cutter for the meat and then makes the patties by hand. The patty is seasoned with sea salt, black pepper, onion, garlic, paprika and a little bit of cayenne. The marmalade contains slow-roasted shallots with brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil and fresh jalapeno for a spicy-sour combination that adds to the layers of flavor.
"It's one thing looking at a burger and another how it holds: The texture, how it bites," Collins says, examining the burger approvingly. "This tastes great. I'm just into the meat now. The onions and tomatoes are such good quality, they kick in first. And as it goes on, the meat comes through. The meat on its own would probably be too rich, which is why they've balanced it well. The chips are a great accompaniment. Hear that crunch."
The 
 is a beef patty with foie gras, short ribs, horseradish mayo and confit tomatoes. It contains 7 ounces (200 grams) of ground chuck from the U.K.; the mayo features freshly grated horseradish. For the topping, short-rib is braised in red wine; the meat is removed and the sauce reduced, with diced vegetables and black truffle. A slice of foie torchon (which has its own, separate, 48-hour process to make), goes on top and both sides of the home-made brioche bun with black poppy seeds get the horseradish mayo.
"It's holding together brilliantly," Collins says. "The short ribs just smack you in the mouth in a brilliant way, then the horseradish kicks in, the sweetness of the confit tomato. It's layered nicely. The bun is still holding together; knives and forks are not necessary. It's just tomato, horseradish and a couple of different types of beef but it's done with aplomb.
"I've eaten burgers from the gutter up to Michelin star. What I particularly like about this, which gives it the edge over CUT, is the horseradish. They’ve Anglicized it quite nicely and they need it to cut through the short rib. It's nicely thought out. The tomato confit is a good idea. Instead of tomato sliding out when you bite it you get a little with every mouthful. This is the best of the day, but only by a whisker."
Even burger aficionados can only manage so many in a single afternoon. Here are a couple of bling burgers I tried earlier:
Japanese wagyu burger with a slice of seared foie gras, Tropea sweet-onion marmalade and fresh truffle, mayonnaise with Italian eggs and lambs lettuce. It's served with truffle fries.
This is a fine burger: The meat is soft and rich, almost melting on your tongue as layers of flavor wash over you in an umami tsunami. If you find the price difficult to digest, it's wise to remember that this is a 
. If you have your Bugatti Veyron parked outside, it may be a bargain.
The 
 is a variation on a beef Wellington. Angus beef is char-grilled, then mature cheddar cheese is added, along with caramelized onion, bacon compote, roasted tomatoes. It's served inside a buttery pastry, with truffle French fries
So it's not really a burger, and purists may choke to see it included here. But it is good: I love those mashed up ingredients melting into one another. I'd just like more meat and more seasoning.
Ah well. It was fun while it lasted. Back to Shake Shack.

=== Title: L'Enclume Wins Good Food Guide 2016 Top Restaurant - Bloomberg ===

L'Enclume has been named the U.K.'s best restaurant, taking the Waitrose Good Food Guide title for the third year in a row.
Chef Simon Rogan's 
 in the northwest of England saw off the challenge of Gordon Ramsay, who moved to second place from third. Pollen Street Social jumps three positions to third place.
Other London restaurants in the Top 50 include Hibiscus (5th), The Ledbury (8th), The Square (11
), Fera (12
), Le Gavroche (13
), Marcus (15
), Alain Ducasse (25
) and Dinner (26
). Robin Gill of the Dairy and the Manor, based in Clapham, south London, wins chef of the year.
The Good Food Guide was first published in 1951 and is now in its 65
 edition. In its earliest incarnation it listed 600 establishments across Britain where you could order a good meal at a reasonable price. Anyone who remembers postwar U.K. food must wonder how low the bar was set at that time.
Then, as now, the results were based on anonymous inspections of restaurants as well as feedback from diners.
The 2016 edition – on sale on Sept. 7 – names Ox, in Belfast, as restaurant of the year. The best new pub accolade went to the Lickfold Inn, West Sussex.
"I am over the moon that we have achieved this three years running. There are so many great restaurants that would be deserving of that place at the top and I couldn't be happier that we are still there. We don't stand still, we keep moving forward," Rogan said when reached by telephone.
Rogan's London restaurant, Fera, ranked 12th and the French, Manchester came 17th. 
"We'll try to remain there next year. I am very proud of my team in all the restaurants," he said.

=== Title: Bompas & Parr’s Alcoholic Architecture: Where Breathing Will Get You Buzzed - Bloomberg ===

Cocktail fans in London will want to take deep breaths when they enter a pop-up bar that opens on Thursday, July 30, on the site of an ancient monastery in Borough.
 features a walk-in cloud of cocktail that's composed of fine spirits and mixer at a ratio of 1:3. It's made using powerful humidifiers to super-saturate the air. Alcohol enters the bloodstream mainly through the lungs but also the eyeballs. Guests are advised to "breathe responsibly." 
It's the project of Sam Bompas and Harry Parr, two friends who specialize in experiences based around flavor. Previous 
 events included one at which whiskies were consumed from the contours of bodies of people the same age as the drink. (Don't worry: They were rare 25- to 39-year-old single malts.)
Guests will descend through a series of dimly lit passages into a monastic-themed changing room, where they will robe up in protective clothing to prevent them from smelling like a cocktail when they go home. After that, it's into a crypt-like bar that appears to have been hewn out of rock. The drinks will be based on those made by monks, including Chartreuse, Benedictine, Trappist beer, and Buckfast fortified wine. From there, it is a short step into the cocktail chamber.
"Inside, the sound is modulated, so that it is like you are right inside the glass," Parr says. "It's a dense atmosphere that builds into a thunderstorm with lightning. It's a new way of experiencing drink, and it's social because it's an immersive shared environment. You all have the same flavor sensation. 
"It's like going to the seaside and finding that fish and chips taste better. Part of that is that in a human environment, your ability to perceive taste is heightened. It's the opposite of being in an aeroplane. Alcohol tastes better, with more nuances: You can detect more subtle flavors when it is humidified."
Guests will be allocated one-hour time slots so they don't have time to get drunk on the atmosphere, which Parr estimates at one unit of alcohol per hour. Entry is £10 ($15.60), or £12.50 at peak times. Canonical Cocktails from the bar will cost £8 and Sacred Shots £5. Mixed drinks for sharing include a loving cup made from a human skull.
The bar is managed for Bompas & Parr by Johnny Brissenden, formerly a bartender at Tony Conigliaro's Bar Termini and Soho House Group. 
Bompas & Parr started gaining wide attention when they created a vibrating jelly for chef Heston Blumenthal that was powered by a sex toy. Other projects include Mercedes Drive Thru, a pulsating light installation that illuminated as diners drove through it, and a carnal carnival at the Museum of Sex in New York.

=== Title: This Is the One Trick That Will Transform Your Caesar Salad - Bloomberg ===

I was surprised when leafy green euphoria followed a bite of the “five lettuce Caesar” at Upland, chef Justin Smillie’s six-month-old establishment in Manhattan. The salad didn't look like any Caesar I'd ever had. 
It was a bounty of colorful leaves—purple Treviso and Tardivo and violet-studded yellow Castelfranco radicchios, lime green Little Gem lettuces, deep blue-green Lacinato kale, and hot pink tie-dyed watermelon radish rounds. And loads of depth.
The name had misled my dining companion, too, who awaited the creamy cheesiness of a traditional Caesar, made from the inner leaves of Romaine lettuce, tossed-in grated Parmesan, and a lemony dressing that contains mustard, garlic, pounded anchovy fillets, and egg yolk. Caesar salads are usually topped with big croutons and sprinkled with an extra helping of Parmesan, but these were nowhere to be found.
So I was skeptical, until I tasted it. The salad was lighter, sharper, and cleaner than the classic but with all of the same essential flavors. Sweet red wine vinegar, bitter greens, sour lemon, peppery radish, and something mysteriously savory played nicely off one another. The leaves were dusted with delicate breadcrumbs instead of croutons. I tasted a burst of anchovy in the dressing, but there was another flavor there, something I couldn’t place. 
It was late on a Saturday afternoon when I met up with Smillie to find out. The chef resembles a giant version of the Dennis the Menace cartoon character—boyish, blond, mischievous. While a crowd of stylish New Yorkers lingered over brunch, Smillie and I worked at the kitchen pass, illuminated with soft glowing golden light. A clean-cut sous chef arrived with the prep—a small sheet tray of leaves; a bowl of breadcrumbs; and nearly sheer radish rounds floating in ice water.
“I wanted to make an 
 salad,” Smillie explained as he took over and squeezed an entire tube of anchovy paste into a bowl, followed by two large spoonfuls of Dijon mustard. Anchovy paste, found at most specialty food stores, is simply finely puréed salt-cured anchovy fillets with a touch of neutral oil, such as sunflower seed oil. While many Caesar salad recipes call for grinding anchovy fillets into the garlic using the side of a knife blade, Smillie cuts this step by using a good-quality paste. (He prefers one by Scalia, a Sicilian brand.) Herein lies the secret—doubling down on anchovies.
Though the restaurant was named after Smillie’s birthplace in San Bernardino County, and the food is described as Californian, Smillie spent years honing his Italian cooking skills with Jonathan Waxman at Barbuto and most recently at the helm of Il Buco Alimentari. So it’s only natural that he uses these tiny, saltwater fish with abandon.
“We make our dressing with less vinegar, then we refresh it with a burst of citrus and olive oil on the pickup,” Smillie said. He tore the kale leaves in two, but the other greens went into the mixing bowl whole. Then he sprinkled a teaspoon of breadcrumbs over the salad and carefully folded in the dressing. It’s those breadcrumbs that give the salad, as Smillie puts it, “a mysterious oceanic flavor that you can’t put your finger on.” It's because he mixes in anchovy powder with the crispy crumbs. 
He discovered the technique at Il Buco Alimentari, when he was toying with a dehydrator and oil-packed anchovies: The dried fish crumble into an intensely flavorful powder. I’ve since sprinkled Smillie’s savory pixie dust over steak, spaghetti, and eggs. Like truffles, soy sauce, and MSG, this powder offers a hard dose of umami—truly habit-forming savoriness. 
Though Upland sells about 50 of these “Caesar” salads a night, seasonality will force the dish to evolve. “In another two weeks, we’ll replace the watermelon radishes with lime radishes. And as the kale gets sweeter this summer, the dressing may need to be more acidic,” said Smillie as he pulled a curled watermelon radish from the icy deep. He shook the water off and tucked it between a Treviso and Little Gem. Smillie thinks that leaving the radish a little wet and without dressing makes it taste refreshing, the same way a cold glass of water does. 
When it comes to the lettuces, Little Gems, Castelfranco, Tardivo, and Treviso radicchios can be hard to find, in which case you can use any combination of radicchio, curly kale, endive, Romaine, or even thin slices of Brussels sprouts. An all-kale salad or all-Treviso could be delicious too, but as you build it, think about how to balance the bitterness of the radicchio with the sweetness of romaine. 
Whether or not you want to call your salad a Caesar? That’s up to you, too.
 
Serves 6 as an appetizer (or 3 for lunch)
Active Time: 1 hour
Total Time: 9 to 11 hours
⅓ pound (about ⅓ large loaf) Italian white bread 
1 (2.8 ounce) jar oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained 
½ teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons anchovy paste
2½ teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon honey
½ small clove garlic, finely grated
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
½ cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 watermelon radish, or other radish
4 cups ice water
1 head Little Gem lettuce 
1 head Treviso radicchio
1 head Tardivo radicchio
1 head Castelfranco radicchio
1 small head Lacinato kale
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Juice of about 1 lemon
Extra-virgin olive oil, to drizzle
1. Make the anchovy crumb: Three days before preparing the salad, cut the crust off the bread; discard or save the crust for another use. Cut the crust-less bread into thick slices and lay on a baking sheet at room temperature to dry, ideally for three nights. (In a pinch, you can dry the bread for just one night but grind it a second time after toasting the crumbs, step 3 below.)
2. The night before, preheat the oven to 175°F. Lay the anchovies flat on a wire rack set over a small baking sheet. Set in the oven until dry, 8 to 10 hours. 
3. The next day, preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the bread slices in a food processor and puree into fine crumbs. Spread the crumbs on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely. Place 2 tablespoons of breadcrumbs in a small bowl and stir in ½ teaspoon of olive oil; set aside. Reserve the remaining breadcrumb for another use.
4. Using a mortar and pestle, grind the dried anchovies into a powder. (Alternatively you can crumble them using a rolling pin.) Combine the anchovies with the oiled breadcrumbs and set aside.
5. Prepare the salad dressing: In a medium bowl, combine the anchovy paste, Dijon mustard, honey, and garlic. Whisk in the red wine vinegar. Whisk in the olive oil in a slow stream. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Prepare the salad: Using a mandolin, thinly slice the radish. Place the slices in an ice water bath and let soak for at least 15 minutes.
7. Remove the leaves from the heads of Little Gem, Treviso, Tardivo, and Castelfranco. Remove and discard the spine from the kale and tear the leaves in half. Wash and dry the leaves well, if needed.
8. Make the salad: Place 6 large handfuls of mixed leaves (about 12 leaves of each green) in an extra-large bowl. Place ¼ to ⅓ cup of the dressing around the bowl, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the anchovy crumbs over the greens, and toss together using clean hands. Taste and season as needed with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of lemon juice and olive oil (about 1 tablespoon of each). Place the dressed greens in shallow bowls and tuck in some radish slices in each. Divide 1 tablespoon anchovy crumbs among the salads and sprinkle on top. Serve immediately.

=== Title: London Restaurant Will Be U.K.'s First Where Diners Buy Tickets - Bloomberg ===

A restaurant in London's Shoreditch is to become the first in the U.K. to introduce a system in which diners must purchase tickets in advance—as for a sporting event or the theater—rather than booking a table in the conventional way.
Clove Club Chef Isaac McHale said customers regularly fail to show up or else arrive in fewer numbers than specified on the reservation. In the future, guests will pay for meals when they book, and it will be their loss if they don't come along to eat.
"It's going to ruffle a few feathers," he said in an interview. "But everyone has a problem with no shows and short-seated tables. The more ambitious your restaurant, the more money you spend on ingredients and staff, and you want to keep prices down. We tend to have very high break-evens."
 will initiate the switch in April, starting with software designed by restaurateur Nick Kokonas of 
, in Chicago. It will later move to a 
, which is being pioneered by Kokonas, with backing from chef Thomas Keller of 
 and Twitter Chief Executive Dick Costolo. Diners will purchase tickets via the restaurant's website.
For dinner, Clove Club offers tasting menus at 65 pounds ($97) and 95 pounds and is usually crowded. It holds a Michelin star for its seasonal British menu and is a favorite with chefs and the food crowd. Diners will pay for their food in advance and be free to purchase drinks on the night. 
The system allows restaurants to charge more at premium times, such as midevening. It's not clear if Clove Club will do this. There are normally spare tables at lunchtime, when diners will be free to show up without tickets. 
"Dining is such a part of everybody's lives that it means everybody has strong opinions on it," McHale said. "There are going to be lots of strong opinions on this system, for better or worse. I want to continue to give people a great experience when they come here, and I hope this system will allow us to give them a better experience. That's all I'm interested in."
Chef Wylie Dufresne used Tock to rack up $41,000 in ticket sales in two minutes for 
 in New York, according to Eater.com. The French Laundry and Coi are among U.S. restaurants adopting a ticketing system, Eater said. London restaurateurs regularly complain about customers not showing up. This particularly hurts at such establishments as 
, which are small and popular. At larger restaurants, such as 
, no-shows are largely an annoyance.
Other London chefs will watch Clove Club closely. If the system catches on, the nights when last-minute tables become available at hot restaurants may be coming to an end.

=== Title: Does Kanye West’s Insane Adidas Collection Count as Fashion? - Bloomberg ===

Yesterday, in his own attempt to break the Internet (or at least win Instagram), Kanye West debuted 
with Adidas Originals on the first day of New York Fashion Week. 
Kim and baby North West were there, with Kim in his designs. As was a Who’s Who of the music industry: Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Jay Z, and Beyoncé. (The least she could do, after his public championing of her superior artistry … again.) 
An 
, sure. But the clothes? 
Let’s just say the reviews, like all thoughts and feelings regarding Kanye, 
 
My review in a nutshell: 
.
To Yeezy, I say, "
 called and they want their look back."
I mean, the wig caps and flesh-toned body stockings were a creative flourish, but I didn’t like this post-Apocalyptic/Depression look the first time I saw it. We were promised awesome (to paraphrase Kanye’s voiceover before the start of the show). What we got was a lineup of tattered sportswear, oversized knits, and schlumpfy outerwear. And tights—lots and lots of sheer hosiery. It was like 
 meets 
.
The thing is: As surreal as it is, Kanye's collection isn't totally divorced from the world of fashion.
Tucked into the moon boots and the body stockings were some commercial pieces, ones that reminded us of looks we liked from the 
. Kanye clearly is aware of global trends, and he referred to a lot of things we've been seeing around lately. Below, we've put Kanye's fashion "statements" into the context of the larger design moment. 
Basically, here's what didn't work—and how he could have gotten it right.
I first noticed this 
 during Paris Fashion Week, when designers (such as Cavalli, pictured right) strutted it down the runways. Tip for first-timers: Go with black. It’s more rock 'n' roll, less Fozzie Bear. 
 The addition of bell sleeves to an otherwise nice bomber-style coat ruins this look. Also, no matter how much the Grammy-winning artist loves man cleavage, it'll never be tasteful. Ever.
Updated versions of the bomber jacket have been off and on the catwalk for years. They’re usually snug, smart, and flattering on both men and women. Usually. 
While the hallmarks of the bomber are still there (the elastic cuffs and collar, the useful sleeve pocket) all form and attractiveness have been drained, along with color. The Neil Barrett version on the right is ready to be worn straight off the runway.
Outerwear-as-armor is actually a theme of the new film, 
, out this week. It’s been a staple of menswear ever since military uniforms seeped into popular culture centuries ago. The vest by Emporio Armani, above right, has a futuristic, dystopian vibe without seeming scary. 
What is that strapped around her chest, on the left? We don’t want to know. 
Much of Kanye’s collection was reminiscent of “Derelicte,” the hilariously bad, garbage-inspired clothing collection from the fictional designer Mugatu in the movie 
While in the fashion world, “deconstructed” can mean code for “worn in,” or even “ratty-looking,” Giorgio Armani proves there’s a way to make deconstructed clothes that don't look as if they’ve been left in a moth-filled closet for three years.  
Looking at that shredded sweater on the left, it’s hard not to imagine Will Ferrell in his white Mugati wig, cackling somewhere in the distance.
Tunics are not for every man. In fact, they’re not even for most men. But something about the Dries van Noten version here, with its firefighter-inspired stripe, seems not too far from something you might already have in your closet—like a surf shirt or a graphic tee. 
Kanye’s look on the left is very 
, District 12, right? 
Sweats separates are a great look, when done with clothes that fit and don't look like something left over from your heftier days. They especially work tonally, as at Emporio Armani, in blacks and dark blues (seen above right). 
 Guess how much Kanye is going to charge us for that beaten-down, stretched-out sweatshirt? Actually, let's not. Bring yours to me, y’all, I will wear it in for free. 
We are not advocating that you wear either of these looks out on the street, at least not without something underneath. (If you didn’t undo a button to expose that man cleavage of yours, then put it back away, please.) Still, Dries van Noten is nodding to a trend we’ve seen in a lot of collections this season: a waifish exposure of the flesh, achieved by combining bulky fabrics and open collars. 
If it looks like your shirt got ripped when someone tried to pull it over your head to stop you from punching them back, it’s time to rethink your choices. 
It’s true, bulky sweaters have been all over fashion week. Usually they look comfy and cheery, as in the Steven Alan look on the right.
At left, has anyone ever looked like they were having less fun in a sweater?
 
I am not mad at a backpack moment. But it’s best executed (for men) when done minimally—solid color with thin straps. This works at AMI because it’s part of a outfit, not 
 outfit. 
 Beyond showing off his chest, Kanye must also be a fan of the a chest-strap backpack. His first collection, shown in Paris in 2011, also included one (albeit a big, furry item). But here, with nothing but a bodysuit underneath (above left), I choose to believe her clothes are in that bag.
There is a difference between oversized (Valentino) and shapeless (Kanye). To be fair: Kim 
 pulled this look off. (Leave it to Kanye to lend her the best piece in the collection to wear—tailored, of course). 
 The lack of a strong collar or lapels, plus added length, leaves his version literally hanging off the model. 
Okay, there are tights, the cold weather staple (as seen at Polo Ralph Lauren, above, under a blazer and shorts). And then there are nylon bodysuits. The latter are not clothes; they are body shapers. Like wealth, they should fade into the background and not be flaunted ridiculously upfront. 
 Basically, he just exposed America to Kylie Jenner in her undergarments. (Or at least her 17.5 million followers on Instagram). 
Chunky layers of neutral tones, like this look at Polo Ralph Lauren on the right, work because of the contrasting textures and tones. Oh, and because they remembered to dress the bottom half of the model. 
 That slouchy top ain't half bad, but someone’s steaming her pants backstage, right? 

=== Title: Lyle’s in Shoreditch Serves Stripped-Down Fare That Stands Out - Bloomberg ===

 looks like the gallery that it used to be.
The walls are white in this Shoreditch restaurant, the floor is bare, and the large windows flood the room with natural light. It serves stripped-down food in a stripped-down room.
That's not to say the dishes are plain. A starter of cured cod, for example, is sprinkled with nasturtium. The yellow-and-red colors lift the look of the plate just as the peppery flavors elevate the salty fish. It's simple and clean, yet delicious.
This is a restaurant by chef James Lowe. He formerly worked at the nearby 
 with co-owner John Ogier, who runs the front of house. While Lyle's carries some of the DNA of St. John, Lowe came to wider attention as one of the Young Turks, a collective of chefs with Isaac McHale, who now presides at 
, another modern British restaurant in Shoreditch. Financial backing comes from Karam Sethi and his family, who own 
 and 
 and also back 
 and 
. London has few such successful restaurant stables. (Sethi is about to add another venue, 
, serving Taiwan street food.)
At Lyle's, the style is friendly and informal. There's a bar at one side of the room and an open kitchen at the other. For dinner, there is a short tasting menu. At lunchtime, you pick from about six starters, three mains, and three desserts. The small-plate starters are particularly good. An expertly seasoned pheasant parfait came topped with thinly sliced, raw portobello mushrooms sprinkled with beetroot powder. The soft rich parfait, again with spot-on seasoning, worked so well with the crunch of the mushrooms, I wanted more.
In fact, my main reservation at Lyle's is over the portion sizes, which are small. On the other hand, the prices are low—the parfait costs 5.90 pounds ($9.08) and the cod 5.50 pounds—so the best option is to order many dishes and share.
Another starter, blood cake ($7.90), was served with burnt-apple purée and grated walnuts. It was rich and sweet and moist, like a kiss on the plate. I'm getting distracted here.
Among the mains, Old Spot, turnip, and anchovy (15.50) featured beautiful British pork with turnip tops. The meat was juicy and sweet, while the anchovy emulsion added a salty kick. The dish had a yin-and-yang balance, swapping a kiss for ancient Chinese philosophy without missing a beat.
That's Shoreditch for you.
Desserts included a caramel, pear, and ginger loaf that was fresh, with a hint of spice, and not too sweet.
Lowe obtains his produce from a network of farmers and suppliers that he has developed over eight years. The bread, butter, charcuterie, preserves, and pickles are made in-house.
For my most recent meal at Lyle's, Lowe wasn't in the kitchen and there was no drop in standards under sous chef Arran McCredie. The service was also notably good: friendly and approachable and very knowledgeable. Our (Italian) waitress said she eats at Lyle's on her days off, and I don't blame her.
The wine list is short and adventurous, with several options available by the glass and carafe. An Austrian white, Gelber Muskateller 2013, Ewald Zweytick, Südsteiermark (37 pounds), worked well both as an aperitif and with the fish. It comes from 
, just across the road, which stocks only Austrian wines, from a range of small producers.
Lyle's doesn't try to be a fine-dining establishment. Lowe sets aside the sauces and the sorcery to show what a U.K. chef can achieve with British ingredients in a London restaurant.
In the process, he shows how far the city has traveled in 20 years, from culinary desert to dining destination.

=== Title: Nineteen Top Women Chefs Speak Out on Their Barriers to Success - Bloomberg ===

 The appointment of Kim Woodward as the 
 at London’s 
 in its 126-year history certainly caught the attention of other women.
"I punched the air," says Anna Haugh, head chef at 
, which (like the Savoy Grill) is owned by Gordon Ramsay. "We're in a time when you are going to be left behind if you are only going to choose boys for leading in the kitchen."
Women head the kitchen in some of London's leading restaurants, including 
 and 
. Ramsay himself has been one of the main champions of women chefs, including Angela Hartnett, who is probably the best-known in the U.K. She's almost a national treasure. I thought it high time to talk to these women about whether or not this is a trend, and how they felt about the changing face of professional kitchens in London. It was only when I started calling around that I realized just how many there are. I stopped seeking comments when my total reached 20. 
Some were fatalistic, saying that family commitments are likely to keep the numbers down in the long run. Others said things were changing, that the traditional male dominance in London restaurants was fading away. And some disputed that women had been disadvantaged at all.
Here's what they had to say:
"Twenty years ago, there were hardly any women in the kitchen. But in the last few years, women are becoming very strong, and we're going to see more women in charge. Kitchens were always dark and hidden away, but now they are often in the restaurant. It's a different ambience, more open and enjoyable."
"I have five restaurants, and three of those are run by women. I try and employ by ability and drive. It just so happens that they are women. They were the ones that were prepared to work hard and push through the pain and are passionate."
"We have always had at least 50 percent women in our brigade here at Clarke's, sometimes as high as 75/25 female-to-male ratio, so I think it's something of a myth about there being a shortage of female head chefs. Perhaps it's down to the fact that on the whole, women are more modest about their capabilities and achievements than their male counterparts, and so you just have to look harder to find them."
"At one stage, you just have to make a choice. You have to be very, very involved for long hours—a difficult job when you are a chef. Many women want to be a wife; they want to be a mother. And I'm not sure that everything is compatible."
"At a certain stage in their career, it comes down to the choice of whether or not to have a family. A pregnant woman in the kitchen is not ideal or easy: I've been there. Taking time out to raise a child obviously will affect your time in a kitchen, which is normally 7 a.m. until midnight. Not everyone can afford child care and nannies."
"There are quite a few amazing women chefs: Angela Hartnett, Anna Hansen, Ruth Rogers—and that's just London. Ruth, along with Rose Gray and Alice Waters, and Maggie Beer, have been some of my biggest inspirations. The fact remains though, that many women are put off by the hours and the daunting prospect of juggling it all with family commitments."
"Honest answer? I have no idea. Common sense tells me it's the hours, but as 
 said on 
: It's a man's world, get over it. I've got two female head chefs and one female sous chef. All my managers are female, so it's not a lack of females in the industry. We just don't blow our own trumpets like you boys."
 
"There are plenty of female executive chefs, but they are not necessarily in the public eye so much. It is fun to see the girl getting appointed at the Savoy after 126 years. It's encouraging. There is an element of sexism, but times are changing. For decades, we've been the ones at home, breeding, but it's not our passage in life anymore."
"The industry is very different from how it used to be: We're in a time that is exciting for women and men. Those who work the hardest and put the time in in the kitchen and have ideas can succeed. It's not being a woman that holds you back. I can't speak for the past, only the present, and everywhere I look, there are women inspiring me. I was very excited when Kim got the job [at the Savoy Grill]. I punched the air. It's great for all women. You are going to be left behind if you are only going to choose boys for leading."
"It's very difficult to balance the job and having children where in society, generally women are the primary carers at home. It's not that it can't be done, and some people manage very well, but maybe women have already left the kitchen before the position of head chef, so there are fewer sous chefs to become head chefs. There are also fewer women in kitchens at any level, so there will always be a smaller pool of people to draw from when it comes to the head chef position."
"Like any high-powered job (you don't see many female CEOs, either), running a restaurant is extremely challenging on all fronts. The pressure is intense, the stress oftentimes overwhelming, and the hours are long. You have to be able to wear the pants, and it can be very difficult to do so and have a balanced personal life as well, which makes having a family challenging."
"There aren't that many female chefs, so the likelihood of female head chefs is a lot lower in the first place. So the question is: Why do so few women want to join the profession?' I think this career path is seen as a tough environment, sometimes intimidating, with long, unsociable hours and low pay, which doesn't appeal to a lot of young women."
"Times are changing. Women are having babies later, and more and more women are coming along. To be honest, I've always seen it as a huge advantage [to be a woman] because you stand out more. I've never seen it as an issue. It's an awesome and exciting job for both sexes."
"Statistically, there are fewer female chefs than male. And then the age when you might become a head chef, in your thirties, is when women are thinking about having families, and the two don't correlate. I'm getting married next year, and I don't know what I am going to do."
"There are loads and loads of women head chefs. They are just not on camera." [You don't see this as an issue?] "No."
"There is a time when you have small children and it can be very hard. But things may be changing because there is a lot of focus in the industry on achieving a work-life balance for everyone, and when that happens, things will be easier." 
"Everywhere you look, in every profession, there are not enough women. We need examples, we need mentors, we need role models, and now we are getting them. Now I can name a lot of women chefs. I couldn't before. About 50 percent of the chefs in River Café are women."
"More female chefs are showing they have the skillset and the determination to run a successful kitchen. My sous chef is a woman. It was society as a whole, where men were expected to be in the restaurant kitchen and women in the kitchen at home. Nowadays, women are proving they want more, and they can be just as good as any men out there."
"More women chefs are being encouraged to come forward. It's a breakthrough. Women weren't recognized before. It was always male-dominated. But more and more women are being recognized. It is really exciting."
(Clare Smyth of Gordon Ramsay wasn't available for comment.)
 

=== Title: London’s Most Celebrity-Filled Restaurant, the Ivy, Is Back - Bloomberg ===

London's the Ivy, one of the world's most famous celebrity restaurants, reopens today after closing in January—for the first time in 25 years—for a facelift.
Its regular customers, who include countless movie stars, may wonder why 
 waited so long for cosmetic surgery. (It is almost 100 years old.) Well, I can tell you that if you have the connections or patience to get a table, the new look is a dramatic improvement.
The Art Deco dining room is brighter and more beautiful and ready again for a starring role. Fernando Peire, restaurant director and maître d' par excellence, first worked there in 1990 and is ready for anything. 
He still recalls the night when the late Princess Margaret—younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II— dined on the same night as the novelist Salman Rushdie, the subject of a fatwa by Ayatollah Khomeini requiring his execution.
"We’re not a restaurant for allowing security in except, for example, when Princess Margaret was alive," Peire says. "She would have her armed detectives on one corner table and then we had armed detectives coming in with Salman Rushdie, and I was going to have to put the detectives next to each other. 
"So I had to stop the second table as they came in and say, 'Look, I have to warn you: The men at the table next to you are going to be armed tonight, and I don’t want this to end up in a shoot-out.' That’s one of my magic moments."
The princess was a regular diner and one evening had to wait in the bar while her table was prepared.
"Some people came in and were a little bit edgy because it's after theater and they haven’t eaten since lunchtime," Peire says. "It's maybe 10:30, and I said I was terribly sorry, but they would have to wait. And they started getting crazy and saying they'd booked their table and wanted to sit down.
"And I said: 'Well, everybody's waiting,' and there's Princess Margaret, good as gold, drinking her Famous Grouse. That suddenly created a silence and everybody was very happy to have another drink in the bar."
That tiny bar, partitioned off at the entrance, has been swept away in the new look by designer Martin Brudnizki Design Studio. You now walk straight into the dining room, which is much lighter, with a clear view of the famous stained-glass windows along both sides and a 20-seater bar for dining at the center.
The Ivy used to be known for its good and bad tables, with a section toward the back being social Siberia. That is where I was seated after I called in July 2006 to book a table. 
"You're very lucky," the receptionist said. "We've just opened our latest six-month booking period." Unfortunately, no Friday or Saturday night reservations were available, but they could give me an early table on a Wednesday night—a Wednesday night six months later, in January 2007.
(When I arrived, I ran into a colleague who had a contact at the restaurant and had booked two hours earlier.)
In those days, as a civilian, you took what you could get.
"There was a moment when, if you weren't unbelievably famous or super-well-connected, you couldn’t eat at the Ivy at a peak time because it was like a club," Peire says.
"I remember a night when Sylvester Stallone was in with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and they were with some very powerful PR person, and the table was meant to be, like, for six or something. We didn’t even have a table, but I thought, it's going to be big news to get them in, and it will be good for the Ivy.
"That turned into 16 or 17 people on what was really only a table for 10 when you pushed things together. And then you had the beefcakes in the bar, and I was constantly pushing them outside. Celebrities as customers are generally absolutely fantastic and very rarely difficult. Ask about the minders and the entourage, and then you are in minefield."
These days, the Ivy has stiff competition from such other restaurants as 
 and 
 for celebrity diners. How will such rivals affect the Ivy?
"I enormously welcome competition," Peire says. "There is a crowd that chases fashion and wants to be where the heat is, wants to be where the latest party is, and I see those people around London restaurants. It's not an enormous crowd, but it’s a crowd. There are lot of other crowds, too. But the Ivy, more than most restaurants, doesn’t have just one crowd.
"Dining out is changing because there are so many more restaurants. The times of the powerful restaurateur who calls all the shots are gone, and you do have to be more democratic."
The Ivy traces its history to 1917 and quickly became a favorite with actors, thanks to its proximity to the theaters of London's West End. Over the decades, it has remained a favorite of celebrities, though the current incarnation dates to 1990, when it was created by restaurateurs Chris Corbin and Jeremy King.
They sold it and went on to open the 
, another celebrity haunt. It is now owned by the entrepreneur Richard Caring. Peire, who was born in Gibraltar and educated at the Latymer Grammar School in London and at Manchester University, joined in 1990 as Senior Maître d'. He quit after eight years and returned in 2007 as director.
If you have never been to the Ivy, you may be surprised. 
First, the menu is filled with comfort food. It is not a gastronomic restaurant. Second, it is not expensive. Many of the starters cost less than 10 pounds ($15). The burger is 13.75 pounds; Pimm's Royale jelly with lemonade sorbet is 8.75 pounds.
Third, it is not snobby. The service is friendly. It feels like a private club. (But the Club at the Ivy, which opened next door in 2008, siphons off some of the regulars, so it is easier for the rest of us to get a table.)
Just don't push your luck in arguing for a better table, or trying to take a snap of a celebrity, or seeking any kind of special treatment. Peire, while he is disarmingly charming, has several red lines that cannot be crossed.
"The things that people ask for that we absolutely refuse to do are things that impinge on everyone else's enjoyment," he says. "For example, a birthday cake with candles, because you know that as soon as you've got a candle lit, they're all going to start singing that bloody song. And then there's the, '
Or,
No.
"What gets us really going is when people say it's my daughter's 20
 birthday and I'd like to do something really special for her. And we say, '
 Well, is there anything else you can do?" Peire laughs. "And I think maybe I could take my clothes off and do a dance."  

=== Title: British Chef to Show New Yorkers How to Make a Great Cheeseburger - Bloomberg ===

You might think April Bloomfield took a risk in 2004 when she opened a gastropub in New York's Greenwich Village: Would Americans go for the British chef's full-on dishes such as sliced beef tongue with salsa verde, farm egg and croutons, served in a noisy bar?
The 
 turned out a hit, with diners willing to wait hours for a  table. Now, Bloomfield and her business partner, Ken Friedman, are going a step further, with plans for a hamburger joint to tempt the palates of picky New Yorkers who are already spoiled for choice.
Bloomfield is going to buy whole steers and then grind them for the patties, while also making her own cheese, pickles, mustard and buns at Salvation Burger, which is scheduled to open in mid-November on East 51
 Street, near Third Avenue. The meat will come from 
, a farm in upstate New York.
"I'm very excited about it: I wanted to start grinding my own beef and it started from that," Bloomfield says in an interview at 
, another of her New York restaurants.
"We're going to do hot dogs. We're going to do boozy milk shakes -- fun stuff like salted caramel and banana with bourbon. We are going to have a little take on Filet-o-Fish, and then we've got a classic beef which is the two skinny patties, and then an 8-ounce with a bun and maybe some smoked short-ribs with funky cheese."
Bloomfield, who formerly worked at Kensington Place, Bibendum and the River Cafe in London, is already known for her beef burgers at the Spotted Pig and lamb burgers at the Breslin. Her other restaurants include the John Dory Oyster Bar in New York and Tosca Cafe in San Francisco.
She and Friedman also own 
, near the site of Salvation Burger, which will seat about 75 diners. The area isn't known for its restaurants. Why there?
"Every spot in New York deserves its own little place," she says. "And I live right there, which is good."

=== Title: These Restaurants Have the Best Wine Lists in the World - Bloomberg ===

I’ve long thought that New York tops just about everywhere if you want to drink the widest selection of great wines. 
It turns out that critics tend to agree. According to the 2015 
’s Best Wine List Awards, which are being released on Tuesday, the Big Apple is the best city in the world for wining while dining. 
Forty New York restaurants made it into the top, three-star award category, while the tally for runner-up London was 24. 
Manhattan’s temple of cuisine Eleven Madison Park won the global sweepstakes for the overall best list, beating out Vienna’s Palais Coburg, which topped the best European list and was last year’s top award winner. 
This is the second edition of the annual World’s Best Wine List awards, which were inaugurated in 2014 by British publication 
. (Full disclosure: I was one of the judges for this competition, but I've only just learned the final tally.)  The several thousand entries were accorded none, 1, 2, or 3 stars by our panel; only 300 were three-star winners. The U.S. accounted for 116 of these, but 34 countries, including Vietnam, had at least one prized restaurant. As Neil Beckett, 
 editor, pointed out, this shows how important wine has become to diners everywhere. 
 (The full list of awards can be found at 
) 
Here are the global wine list winners:
Location: New York
What makes it so special is that it’s a perfect blend of hip and classic choices, with the best of the best in every category, from champagne to dessert wines. Yes, there’s the fabulous 1969 Dom Perignon Oenotheque, but if you’re a fan of grower champagne rebels such as Jacques Selosse, you won’t be disappointed. Naturally, great Burgundy, Bordeaux, Rhône, and California wines are well represented with old vintages.  
Location: Munich
Here you can try dozens of great, pricy wines such as Domaine de la Romanée-Conti’s La Tâche by the glass. This is thanks to the handy Coravin system, in which you can draw a sample of wine through the cork via a thin needle. 
Location: New York 
The jazzy design and unusual choices reflect the wine sensibilities of owner Paul Grieco, the apostle of riesling who reignited U.S. interest in the grape. This is where you’ll find the unexpected, such as Frank Cornelissen’s Contadino red from Sicily.
What stands out is the quality and number of choices in both first and business class. Champagnes are not just the ubiquitous Krug Grande Cuvée, but also Bollinger rosé and a 1999 Lanson brut. The mix of six reds and whites in first class includes top Bordeaux Château Léoville-Poyferré; in business class, a Chassagne Montrachet white Burgundy from Albert Bichot.
The extensive core cellar is superb. You won't yearn for land while sipping such hard-to-obtain wines as Didier Dagueneau Pouilly-Fume Silex and cult Rhône Valley red Domaine de Pegau Cuvee da Capo—or selecting from a diverse by-the-glass list. Destination-specific additions feature fascinating, sometimes obscure wines from Croatia, Uruguay, and even China.
Location: New York
Blue Hill packs amazing diversity into its under-200 selections, from top Corsican rosé Domaine de Marquiliani made from the sciaccarello grape to the ripe, luscious Shinn Estate Nine Barrels from Long Island to grand wines such as Domaine Chave Hermitage from the Rhône.  
Location: Dunkeld, Australia 
The backdrop of this restaurant and hotel is the Grampians National Park, and—even if you stayed there for a week—you’d hardly make a dent in this comprehensive wine list. In addition to the expected greats from France and Italy, you’ll find the best of Australia, from such cutting-edge producers as Mac Forbes to old vintages of cult wine Wendouree. 
Location: Portland, Ore. 
This casual wine bar with red damask wallpaper held on to the title it won last year. The list of 250 wines is a grower-champagne lover’s dream, and includes many single vineyard bottles from hip producers such as Cedric Bouchard and Jerome Prevost at astonishingly low prices. 
Location: Tokyo 
The specialty here is a surprisingly long list of great American wines, from Kalin Cellars' rare, renowned Sémillon from Livermore Valley to Screaming Eagle. But Europhiles needn’t worry: There are plenty of top Burgundies, Bordeaux, and Champagnes.
Location: Boulder, Colo.
An elegant typeface and clever, innovative organization make this list easy to read and navigate. Put together by master sommelier Bobby Stuckey, it offers stellar selections, including top Burgundies, at reasonable prices.
Location: Vienna
I can’t imagine any wine lover, no matter how sophisticated, who wouldn’t drool over this list of great sweet wines, with Hungarian Tokaji wines dating back to 1845 and vintages of Château d'Yquem ranging from 1893 to 2001. 

=== Title: Kitty Fisher's Is London's New Hottest Restaurant - Bloomberg ===

 is no longer London’s toughest table. The baton has passed to a tiny bistro in Mayfair that feels more like a country pub than a dining destination.
The ceilings are as low as the prices, and there’s no outward swagger at 
, named after an 18th century courtesan. Red lights hang in the bar in her memory, and the establishment sits in 
, an area historically associated with prostitution. Other claims to fame include the fact that musicians Mama Cass Elliot and Keith Moon both died nearby, and the fictional “Jeeves” character lived on a neighboring street. As for gastronomy, there’s a Polish-Mexican bistro, L’Autre, with blini and burritos.
So you might be forgiven for setting your expectations low. Until, of course, you attempt to get a table: Try calling, and you’ll get a message saying the booking line is open just eight hours a week, no reservations are being taken for dinner, and lunch is served from Tuesday through Friday only.
(Prime Minister David Cameron has dined here. Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson is among those who have taken to Twitter to sing the restaurant’s praise, saying she had “just eaten about everything on the menu.”)
Yet there’s no sign of arrogance once you enter the small bar, into which a few tables are jammed. The owners are charming former actors, and the waitresses are among the most engaging I’ve met. No one is picking up the phone, they say, because they hadn’t expected many calls and so didn’t hire people to answer it.
The menu is short, and I would have called it Mediterranean had I not been told it was Basque-inspired. It’s based around a wood grill in a cramped little kitchen where Tomos Parry works wonders. He’s not a big name yet but did win best chef in the Young British Foodies awards last year, and he has Noma, the Ledbury, and most recently 
 in Hackney on his résumé.
Grab a table downstairs, and you can watch him at work while seated in a small room with red-upholstered couches, a wooden floor, a gold-painted ceiling, and low-hanging lights that are almost as likely to deliver a bang on the head as they are to provide illumination.
A meal might start with delicious crusty bread that’s scorched on the grill and then served with whipped butter and a dusting of burnt onion, a black powder that adds a hint of extra char.
Snacks include a creamy taramasalata, or whipped cod’s roe, served on thin strips of toast “soldiers” with fennel butter and micro-cress. These have a clean, lemony flavor. Or there are salt-cod croquettes, gooey beneath their crunchy coating. On another day, breaded Cornish mussels were offered with a vivid wild garlic mayonnaise. Each snack costs £6 ($9), and the bread is £3.
Among my favorite dishes are lamb cutlets, rare beneath a beautiful char and topped with anchovy, mint, and parsley for a sharpness that plays with the sweetness of the meat.
Simple and equally flavorsome is grilled calves’ liver, served rare with Roscoff onions and wild garlic. Here the rich, pink meat melts once you bite through the sear. The onions are sweet and soft, the garlic a surprisingly gentle taste of spring.
The dishes change daily, but one to be aware of whenever you go is the Galician beef sirloin, which may not be mentioned on the menu. This is a large serving cooked on the grill and served with onions, pickled walnut, pink fir potatoes, a bit of mustard, and Tunworth, a cow’s-milk cheese with similarities to Camembert.
The meat—from old dairy cows—has a flavor so deep, you might tumble in after a few glasses of wine. It’s long-lasting and insistent, rich as a Mayfair resident, and as redolent of the countryside as a peasant who’s been spreading manure.
There’s a sweetness from the charring and an earthiness from the meat that can be sensational, particularly when combined with the nutty cheese and the acidity of the walnut. The meat varies from day to day, depending on what’s available, so it might not be a perfect 10 every time. But get it on the right day, and you will find the kind of flavor of which steak lovers dream.
The desserts are something of an afterthought, usually with just one pudding, an ice cream, and a sorbet. Having said that, the buttermilk rice pudding with rhubarb and hazelnuts is well-balanced; the brown-bread ice cream and marmalade is like a toasty treat; and the blood-orange sorbet has a refreshing hint of sharpness.
The wine list is short and ungreedy, with a decent Vin de Pays d’Oc 2013 at £4 a glass and £15 a carafe. (And, surprise: It comes from a box. I may have to drop my prejudices, just as I did with screw caps a decade ago.)
I really have trouble recalling such gracious and unhurried service in London. It’s best if you’re not in a hurry, either, as it’s basically just Parry cooking with his mate Chris Leach, formerly of 
 They do everything except wash the dishes. This is not the spot for a quick bite.
Kitty Fisher’s owners include the actor 
, whom you might recognize from 
, and his chum Tom Mullion, whose résumé includes acting, oil trading, 13 months as development director at the Tricycle Theatre, and co-founding 
.
They’re well-connected socially, so it’s not surprising that their small restaurant should be popular with the Mayfair crowd. What is surprising is the quality of the cooking and service.
Kitty Fisher’s is like a private club. Better than that, it’s how you might hope a private club would be. It’s not Chiltern Firehouse—of which I continue to be a fan—although you may well spot the occasional celebrity.
It’s Kitty Fisher’s, and it’s worth persevering to get a table.

=== Title: Own a Piece of the Ivy, London’s Celebrity Canteen Since 1917 - Bloomberg ===

You might think you can't put a price on glamour.
Oh, yes you can.
The contents of that most alluring of showbiz restaurants, 
 in London, go on sale tomorrow, March 25, in a charity auction that will feature everything from its cocktail shakers and napkins to the front doors, doormat, and even the stained-glass windows that have given the Covent Garden restaurant such a distinctive look. The reason? It's getting a makeover by 
 and will reopen in May. The owner, Richard Caring, is selling off its artifacts and artworks to benefit Child Bereavement U.K. 
The Ivy began life in 1917 when then-owner Abel Glandellini and Maitre d' Mario Gallati joined forces and attracted the theater community to their modest café. The name came when Glandellini apologized for building work. The French actress Alice Delysia responded by quoting a popular song of the time, saying: "Don't worry: We will always come to see you, we will cling together like the ivy." Since then it has hosted stars from Laurence Olivier to Marlene Dietrich, Kate Moss to Tom Cruise, and holds a place of honor among 
.
Altogether, there are 58 lots (sold as part of Sotheby's 
 auction), including the battered tray used for tips in the cloakroom. It's difficult to know if that means celebrities are enthusiastic tippers or just inclined to drop a few coins rather than bills. 
Here are 10 lots Sotheby's expects to attract the most attention, be it for their pricey estimates, visual impact, or essential "Britishness." 
This linoleum cut is typical of the work of 
, an artist known for his London scenes. He was commissioned to produce works for the London Underground, and his works are included in the collections of the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, according to ArtRepublic.com.  
This dates to around 1930. It is numbered and inscribed 18/60 USA Ed. 
 was one of the U.K.'s leading photographers in the 1960s, along with David Bailey and Brian Duffy. He also pioneered pop videos, including Robert Palmer's 
. Here is Connery doing his best James Bond. 
Attributed to the architectural practice of M.J. Long, these doors date back to the 1970s and are made with oak, glass, and brass, with bound leather handles. It's easy to imagine an interior designer wanting to get hold of these. 
This was made around 1920 and is visibly dented through use. It's fascinating to think of the celebrities who contributed to this (and those who didn't). 
Tilson was associated with Pop Art in the 1960s and since then has favored more traditional craftsmanship. This 1990 work includes the words, "Best wishes for a Dionysian future at the Ivy" on the reverse. 
This oak and leather upholstered banquette has probably accommodated many of the world's biggest celebrity derrieres. Well, not Kim Kardashian's, but you know what I mean. 
Jones is one of the U.K.'s most controversial artists, with furniture based around women in fetish outfits. These boldly colored murals feature barely clad women, too. 
The Ivy was a great place for cocktails before everyone else started serving them. These are affordable souvenirs in glass mounted with silvered metal. 
 
Riley is a fine artist, and this has long been my favorite artwork at the restaurant. It is striking, modern, and distinctive, yet the colors and style sit happily with the Ivy's Art Deco style. Sadly, I can't afford to bid for it. 

=== Title: Three-Michelin-Star French Chef Loves East London Chicken Shack - Bloomberg ===

Giant vases bursting with colorful flowers fill 
restaurant in the luxurious 
 in London's Mayfair.
Diners sit at tables draped with starched tablecloths where uniformed waiters serve dishes such as
with parsley croutons, which costs 56 pounds ($85.45) for two.
This is the home of French chef Pierre Koffmann, who held three Michelin stars at La Tante Claire before retiring in 2003. He mentored a generation of British chefs, including Marco Pierre White and Gordon Ramsay. When Koffmann was first tempted back to the stove in 2009, thousands of diners tried to book a table.
Restaurants in the edgy Haggerston area of East London are rather different from those in the West End. They are filled with young people who are happy to queue for inexpensive meals in rooms where the main design statements are the diners' tattoos and the closest thing to a carpet is the fuzz that covers male faces.
So what does veteran chef Koffmann make of somewhere like Chick 'n' Sours, a local fried-chicken shop with loud music, rickety tables and a kitchen the size a walk-in fridge?
"I really like it," he says, sitting on a stool at the counter,  tucking into a plate of drumstick and thigh, with General Tso's glaze, chili, spring onion, sesame seeds, and pickled green beans, costing 10 pounds.
"These guys are good.  They use good ingredients. A lot of people would use the cheapest chicken you can buy. Here, it is top quality. The coating is perfect and the cooking is very precise. Everything is perfect. And they are such nice people. I'd come back here, especially with my kids. They will love it. "
Chick 'n' Sours is the new restaurant of Carl Clarke, who is astonished to find that he's cooking for Koffmann.
"He's a legend," Clarke says, while calling out orders. "So having him walking in was surreal. It's awesome. We are a little chicken shack.  It's sick." ("Sick" is good in East London.)
Apart from the fine food, Clarke and his business partner David Wolanski serve fine sour cocktails. 
Koffmann says he admires what Clarke is doing, alongside nearby restaurants 
 and 
, which he also visits during what turn out to be three visits to Haggerston. 
"This is the way you've got to start if you are a young chef," he says. "You find a space where the rent is quite cheap and you do what you've got to: Simple tables, simple chairs. The china is from a second-hand shop. It's impossible to start on your own and spend money on the furniture, on the decor. That would never work. If you want to work on your own, to prove you are a good chef, you come here open a little place and do what you can do best.
"If you want to move to the West End, you will never be your own chef. You will be working for someone else."
Still, some people might be surprised to find enthusiasm for such simple food from a master of gastronomy, known for dishes such as pig's trotter stuffed with sweetbreads and morels, and pistachio souffle with pistachio ice cream.
"There are only two types of food: good food or bad food," says Koffmann, who was born in Tarbes, southwest France. "You can have terrible French food. Not everything is good because it is French or Italian. I've had terrible food in Italy, for example.
"Here, the cooking is precise and everything tastes good. The same thing at Berber and Tonkotsu. It's nice to move out from the center. The best thing is that you see young people starting their own business on a small budget. That is the way it should be."

=== Title: Bao Review: Taiwanese Street Food Has Londoners Queuing Down the Road - Bloomberg ===

The queue along Lexington Street in London's Soho is the first clue to the popularity of 
, a no-reservations Taiwanese street-food joint in Soho.
The line forms before this tiny new restaurant opens for lunch or dinner and doesn't ever seem to diminish during service. Latecomers are politely turned away at closing time. The minimal, blonde-wood covered dining room is crowded with happy eaters perched along a counter where tea is prepared or squeezed into tables at the back, near the kitchen.
And it's all about a little Chinese bun—the 
which is made with milk. It may be the best lactic treat you've had since your mum. It's fluffy and soft and white like a hotel pillow. All it's missing is a little chocolate wrapped in foil.  
The menu is short, with nine small plates; six types of bao, including a dessert version of fried Horlicks ice cream; and four sides, including a drink of peanut milk. The drink list is shorter, with beers and sake. I wish they had wine, but I guess that would slow the flow of punters to a dribble.
But the buns—oh, the buns: They come loaded with beautiful meat, perfectly seasoned. All are delicious, yet each is distinctive. Lamb shoulder comes with a fragrant coriander sauce, a spiky garlic mayo, a hot soy-pickled chili. It flirts with your taste buds, moves through something a little more physical, and reaches the full 
 faster than you can sneeze, "Yes, yes, 
...."
Then the confit pork belly takes charge, crispy shallots providing a crunch contrast to the soft meat. The classic bao features peanut powder along with fermented greens and our old friend coriander for a balanced mix of salty, sweet, and fresh.
The most expensive bao—fried chicken and lamb shoulder—costs 5 pounds ($7.83) apiece. At least, they do for now.
It's a family team of a husband, wife, and sister who run Bao, back and front of the house, where the service is knowledgeable and efficient, as well as being completely charming, from the woman who comes out to chat with people in the queue to the chap who makes tea with the kind of concentration normally reserved for precision engineering (or seduction).
Bao started as street food, but there is an experienced restaurateur behind all this. He's chef Karam Sethi who, with his family, is enjoying a remarkable run of successes, with Trishna, 
, 
, and Kitchen Table, plus 
, where he backs chef James Lowe. 
You don't have to eat bao at Bao. The Taiwanese fried chicken has a crunchy coating, soft meat, and a hot sauce that is distinctly punchy. Slices of 40-day rump cap come with a nice layer of fat and aged white soy sauce. It's beautiful meat (from Cornwall) with great depth, which is fortunate because you don't get much of it for 6 pounds. The soy sauce is from Pintung, in Taiwan. It is made with yellow beans rather than black and comes from the first pressing. It is aged for a sweet and mellow flavor.
Pig blood cake is like a rich, moist, and fatty slice of black pudding and is topped with a soy-cured egg yolk for a bite as rich as a lottery winner.  Nothing is left to chance at Bao, where care meets creativity and the two decided to have fun together.
Don't go expecting fancy food. Don't go for a leisurely meal. Just go.

=== Title: The Secrets Behind Each Dish in London’s Most Fabulous Lunch - Bloomberg ===

Ollie Dabbous is among a group of young chefs who are transforming the London food scene at restaurants such as 
, 
, 
, the 
, and 
.  
The four-course lunch at 
, which costs £35 ($55), is one of 
 and a fine example of the kitchen's focus on just a few ingredients, with attractive presentation and limited ornamentation.
I asked chef Dabbous to explain the lunch dishes in his own words.
"We make the bread here every day. It's something rustic and honest, and I like a loaf with a nice, thick crust and reasonably soft inside. It's almost Germanic in feel. There's quite a bit of rye in there, wholemeal bread, mixed seeds, so you've got sesame, poppy, sunflower, hazelnut, pumpkin. Then we just make our own butter, slightly salted. So: warm bread, nice crust, soft butter. It's a winner. You don’t need bells and whistles. You can actually be more emotive, impressive with something that everyone has had 100 times before but done really nicely."
"That’s been on every spring since we opened. It's a light pea mousse, frozen petit pois, milk, really good fruity olive oil, a little bit of salt and sugar, blended together with a little bit of gelatine. Then we top it with a mix of a mint oil, a few drops of chardonnay vinegar, some raw peas, some cooked peas. The raw peas just give it a kind of vitality. Having the raw peas and the pea shoots just gives a bit of vitality to the dish; it's important to consider texture and rawness in terms of invigorating a dish. It isn’t monotone. The colors also reflect Wimbledon, the green and the purple. It's always on when Wimbledon is on. When you say modern British food, people think of something a little bit heavier or more rooted in tradition. The peas and mint is a great example of something contemporary with a lighter touch."
"This has gone down really well. I was concerned originally because it's like a raw onion dish as a starter. But we use really sweet griotte onions. On the bottom, you've got crushed, toasted pistachios and then a layer of Slipcote cheese, which is a wet sheep-milk cheese we get direct from the farm. It's got a nice sourness. We top that with marigold shoots and they’ve got a kind of coriander seed flavor. For the salad, we use washed onions with lemon dressing, lime zest, and salt.
"The food we serve in the summer is simple. The food we do in general is simple. But for me, personally, when the weather's hot, you just want grilled food and product-based dishes, salads. I could live off vegetarian, salads, and the odd bit of grilled meat or fish while the weather's hot."
"I was never a massive girolles fan, but I like them on the barbecue. Whereas most people go for the small, really perfect girolles, we try and get a slightly meatier mushroom just so it can we can stick it on the barbecue and it can take the heat and the smoke—and not cook too much. 
"The dressing is a mix of smoked bacon fat, mushroom stock, garlic, and lemon dressing. It's served with English pancetta from 
. They do gorgeous stuff. We just grill it very lightly so it's not crispy; it's a bit more like that melt of lardo. And just scattered lemon thyme and a leaf called cordifole, which is a flesh plant—so with the mushrooms and pancetta, they're quite indulgent in texture. Quite soft. You need something to invigorate the dish—the lemon thyme does that, but also the fleshy lettuce stops it being too homogenous." 
The potted shrimp is a classic recipe. We add a little bit of Espelette pepper and garlic, which isn’t traditional, but then mace and lemon juice. The peeled brown shrimps are from 
 (Seafoods) in Cornwall. It's quite a comforting dish, and with the soft-boiled Burford Brown egg, it's like a picnic. We add some oyster leaf and samphire and pickled cucumber. You need counterpoints to stop it being clumsy."
"It's a leg of lamb from Romney Marsh that we bone. It's salted with rosemary, and we cook it at 63 degrees for two hours in the water bath. Then we cook it again quite aggressively on our 
 barbecue. We slice it thinly and serve it on cracked wheat with toasted pine nuts and lesser calamint, which is like a cross between mint and oregano. We have someone grow that for us in Norfolk. Violet mustard is an old French product that we mix with strained yoghurt, and lemon juice and honey, and there's grilled green pepper. The dish is quite feral. The starters are quite refined. But with red meat, you want to be primal.
"And the crepe is just a batter that we fry in a pan and empty onto the barbecue. We drizzle over a little bit of oil and shut the lid. You just char it on both sides and then just rip it into quarters. Again, I don’t like food looking too refined, so we don’t use a knife deliberately. You want the torn edge. And I like the bit of char round the side."
"Everyone loves a fruit tart. It’s the summer, you have a picnic, or whatever; you know it’s just a crowd pleaser. There's no point deconstructing it, or whatever. So we use an all-butter puff for lightness, like those Portuguese custard tarts. It's a classic French pastry cream, egg yolk, corn flour, sugar. We infuse it with Tahitian vanilla and camomile to give it a rounded sweetness, then we fold in Chantilly cream, adding a spoonful of strawberry purée, then wild strawberries and a scatter of clover and a little bit of lavender. We blanch rose petals to soften them and then steep them in rosewater syrup. They have a beautiful color and texture. It's something honest and simple: just one or two things and a couple of counterpoints."

=== Title: London’s So-Called Best Restaurant Is Only Good If You Sit at the Bar - Bloomberg ===

Restaurants where you can sit at a counter and interact with the chefs are becoming increasingly popular in London. They can be very good.
But what happens when those seats are occupied and you are squeezed into a small table at the back? You bump elbows with diners whose conversations you tune into while losing the will to try to pick out the words of the person you’re with.
It’s miserable, and that’s why the 
 passed me by after it opened a year ago. I went along when this small Soho venue made its debut, serving the food of modern-day Jerusalem. Its website boasted “a menu influenced by the rich cultures of Southern Spain, North Africa and the Levant.’’
I was shoehorned into a table so small there was barely room for the dishes. The wine and water were tantalizingly out of reach, while music close to 90 decibels (“very noisy, nerve damage’’ warned my decibel counter) added to the discomfort.
And then Palomar 
 in the 
 Food & Drink Awards on April 28: “The Palomar has without a doubt the most chutzpah of any food and drink establishment operating in the country right now,’’ 
 said, with more hyperbole than punctuation.
Blimey.
A few days later, Palomar 
.
Crikey. 
What had I missed? I returned, sat out back, and decided the world was going mad. The best I could say was that the service was attentive and the food was “tasty.’’ That’s a catch-all word I would normally avoid but it summed up the punchy flavors.
Based on that meal, I would name Palomar the Best Restaurant That Opened on Rupert Street Last Year Serving the Food of Modern Day Jerusalem With a Menu Influenced by the Rich Cultures of Southern Spain, North Africa, and the Levant.
A few days later, I was back again, this time sitting at the 16-seat zinc kitchen bar, directly in front of chef Yossi Elad, who is known as Papi. He greeted me (and other diners) warmly. He engaged with his young brigade—mostly women when I visited—offering help, advice, and encouragement.
“The chef isn’t always right,” he said cheerfully, adjusting the garnish on one plate. “But he’s always the chef.”
If you praised a dish, he looked like he might cry with joy. If you didn’t clear your plate, you felt the need to apologize. He was like a favorite uncle who was also a great cook.
And then I realized something had happened. All the food was tasting better, starting with the kubaneh Yemeni pot-baked bread, which is soft and pillowy. It comes with smoky tahini and the sweetest blitzed tomatoes for dipping. The last time I enjoyed bread so much was at 
.
Shakshukit was the standout dish for me. It’s a “deconstructed kebab” of minced beef and lamb topped with tahini, harissa, pesto, and tapenade. (The recipe 
.)
The pita bread—straight from the Josper grill—is on the side, so you can scoop up the meat. The big flavors are balanced only in so much as they trade punches, competing with each other for your attention and your pleasure.
(I’m generally against the gimmickry of deconstruction. If I were interested in chefs seeking attention for attention’s sake, I’d watch a Gordon Ramsay show.)
The beetroot carpaccio looks gorgeous and features the sweetest of beets, offset by burnt goat’s cheese and sprinkled with hazelnuts and date-and-honey syrup. It’s fresh and tangy, and I might order it again if I hadn’t hated beetroot all my life.
Corn-fed chicken comes two ways: fried in a buttermilk crust and “stroganoffed,” with mixed spice, that comes with tenderstem broccoli and freekeh. You know what freekeh is, right? Of course you do. It’s young green wheat that has been toasted and cracked. (Thank you 
.)
Isn’t that the way? You learn how to pronounce quinoa correctly, and then a new cereal comes along.
This dish is two treats in one--what I would call JFC (Jerusalem fried chicken), with a great crunch, served atop a contrasting creamy, mushy bowl of comfort food your mother might give you if only she knew how to cook.
Other options include a sticky pork belly tajine with ras el hanout (North African spice mix) with dried apricots and Israeli couscous. This is smoky and fatty and fruity all at once. 
There are four desserts, including knafeh. (That’s kataifi and goat’s cheese pastry, whipped cream, and pulverized pistachios). This isn’t too sweet or too rich. It is well-balanced and light enough to enjoy after a relatively heavy meal.
I’d have liked to see more Israeli wines on the list. But having splashed out 60 pounds ($92.39) on Chardonnay Har’el Clos De Gat ‘11, I am reconsidering. For that money, I expected more. Several wines are available by the glass and the carafe. That’s a better bet than buying a bottle that might be out of reach.
Palomar was created with the help of chefs Assaf Granit and Uri Navon, as well as Elad, from Jerusalem’s Machneyuda restaurant. The prices are reasonable: 5 pounds for bread; 10.50 for Shakshukit; 14 pounds for chicken.
It is four years since a restaurant called Quince opened amid much publicity, with the promise of bringing the authentic flavors of the eastern Mediterranean to London. It never caught on and is now long gone. Palomar succeeds where Quince failed. It may even be a game changer, bringing in its wake copycat casual venues serving this sort of food. 
It’s not the best restaurant in London. It’s not even the best in Soho. But it is very good—when you sit at the counter.
Palomar is at 34 Rupert Street, Soho, London, W1D 6DN; +44-20-7439-8777 or

=== Title: Chef Jason Atherton Delays London Restaurant Sosharu - Bloomberg ===

Jason Atherton is delaying the opening of his next London restaurant until next year as the British chef focuses on his new establishments in Dubai and Sydney.
Atherton had planned to open his Japanese restaurant 
 in Clerkenwell in coming months but has now pushed back the date to Feb. 17.
"I'm here in Dubai for a month, with just one day back in London for my daughter's birthday," he said in an interview ahead of the Sept. 3 opening of Marina Social at the Intercontinental Hotel Dubai Marina. "I have to get this right and I do that by physically working in my restaurants.
"That's why you don't see me on TV much," says Atherton, who previously worked in Dubai running Verre for Gordon Ramsay from 2001 to 2004. "It's very important to me that wherever you go in the world, my restaurants are good. I don't want to build a shallow brand based on celebrity. I even hate the term celebrity chef."
No need to take that as a swipe at Ramsay: Atherton regularly pays tribute to his former mentor.
When Atherton returns to London, he plans a series of private dinners prepared by Sosharu chef Alex Craciun to test out dishes that are planned for the menu in Clerkenwell. After that, he will head to Sydney, where Kensington Street Social is scheduled to open in The Old Clare Hotel, in Chippendale, on Nov. 8.
Atherton currently has seven establishments in London: Berners Tavern, City Social, Little Social, Pollen Street Social, Social Eating House, Social Wine & Tapas and the Typing Room. That's in addition to restaurants in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore.
He has just opened 
 in New York to rave reviews. The New York post headlined 
: NYC's best new restaurant is bold, buzzy and beautiful. The website 
 described it as one of New York's best new restaurants.
"New York is very tough," Atherton says. "I was bowled over by the reception. I lived there for 3-1/2 months and made New York my second home to make sure I got it right."
Atherton says Dubai is one of his favorite cities as it was the first overseas city where he ran a restaurant. He has fond memories, from learning to play golf to meeting his wife Irha, who works alongside him as co-director at 
.
Irha also runs the head office in Soho, London. Jason and Irha have two daughters and the family live in South West London.
The next restaurant he is planning after Sosharu is also in London, in Victoria. At last, he may get time at home.

 JD Wetherspoon Plc shares plummeted after the pub operator said the introduction of a national living wage would raise costs and jeopardize the industry’s financial outlook.

=== Title: Another Woman Rises in London's Male-Dominated Restaurant Scene - Bloomberg ===

London restaurants are generally dominated by men, but a Berlin-born woman who gave up her career in sales to take her chances in the British capital is poised to open a second restaurant.
Bandol will serve Nicoise and Provencal sharing dishes in Chelsea, says Sylvia Kontek, a German-Hungarian who was raised in Budapest and studied literature and creative writing at New York University before moving to London eight years ago. Almost two years ago she opened the well-reviewed 
 on Old Brompton Road.
Some female chefs are 
 in London, but not enough: Kim Woodward is the first woman head chef in the 126-year history of the 
; Nieves Barragan of 
 is one of the most celebrated culinary talents in London; Clare Smyth is the custodian of Gordon Ramsay’s three Michelin stars at his flagship in Chelsea.
Woman restaurateurs in London include Sally Clarke (
), Skye Gyngell (
),  Anna Hansen (
), Angela Hartnett (
), Marianne Lumb (
), Thomasina Miers (
) and Ruth Rogers (
).
Kontek’s business partner is Vittorio Monge, a banker in London. Kontek, who previously worked in real-estate and media sales, says she made the switch to restaurants because she and Monge shared a love of food and wine.
“Every day you open your doors and start from zero,” she says. “But there are also a lot of elements that are related to sales. I am selling an experience, and it’s very much people-driven. It’s about the relationships you develop with you suppliers and customers.”
Bandol is scheduled to open next month on Hollywood Road, SW10.
 

=== Title: London's Best Restaurants According to Top Chefs - Bloomberg ===

It was Oliver who gave chef Greg Marchand the nickname that’s now synonymous with lighter, healthier French cooking. At Marchand’s Covent Garden restaurant, that style mixes with influences from the U.K.—bringing in lamb from Wales and rainbow trout from Scotland. “The food is exquisite,” Oliver says. “I knew Frenchie was a clever boy, but he’s just got better and better.” 
This three-Michelin-starred hotel restaurant is a surprising choice for French chef Koffmann, who held three stars at La Tante Claire before abandoning fine dining in favor of the rustic cuisine of his native Gascony. But a recent lunch at Alain Ducasse’s newest space has him reconsidering. “I’m not interested in Michelin restaurants anymore,” Koffmann says, “but it was the best meal I’ve had in a year.” The lobster with chicken quenelles is “perfection,” he says. 
This tiny cafe tucked inside a shipping container in edgy Brixton is one of the most exciting restaurants in town. “It’s 100 times better than you would expect,” says Roux, the two-star Michelin chef at Le Gavroche. A traditional Indian meal of fried pakoras is given a British makeover by using samphire, a salty sea vegetable from the parsley family. “Places like this are the reason why London is the envy of Paris and New York,” Roux says. 
The inspired British dishes at Isaac McHale’s new spot are delighting crowds in this former town hall in East London. “Isaac loves to eat, and it shows in his cooking,” says Smyth, who recently left her post running Gordon Ramsay’s three-star flagship restaurant to open her own with Ramsay’s backing. “It’s great food in a fun environment, and every time you go back, there is something new.” Try the Orkney scallops paired with kelp, oyster cream, horseradish, and carrots. 
 
The Shake Shack mogul loves this Mayfair restaurant, where the basement dining room’s ceiling is so low you bang your head on the lights. “When you walk in, you wonder what all the fuss is about,” Meyer says. “But you give up every ounce of resistance when the food is on the plate.” Due to space constraints, young Welsh chef Tomos Parry cooks on an open-wood charcoal grill as it’s often done in Basque country, giving the Galician beef (it’s not on the menu—ask for it) a gamey and delicious flavor. 
This Spanish tapas restaurant, led by young female chef Nieves Barragán Mohacho, has an inviting atmosphere and inventive menu. “With new food concepts coming along every day, it’s not easy to find one that stays in your mind,” says Peruvian chef Acurio. “But Barrafina stays in your heart, too.” Don’t miss the milk-fed lamb kidneys, which come on a charcoal grill to be cooked at the table. This outpost is one of three locations in Soho and Covent Garden.
This traditional Japanese restaurant in Mayfair receives little media attention, yet it is a favorite of some of London’s most respected chefs, including St. John's Fergus Henderson and Ruth Rogers of the River Café. “I like the quality of the fish and I like the simple décor,” says Rogers. “It is excellent Japanese food without all the stuff that usually goes with it in London. It is pared down. We always have the sashimi, and the sea urchin if it is on the menu.”
Everything in this glamorous Mayfair establishment—from the server uniforms to the elaborate table lamps at the bar—was made in France at an alleged cost of more than $50 million. “It feels like you have stepped back into Shanghai in 1920,” says Sydney-based chef Perry. “All the food is beautiful, and the standout is the Park carbonara, a contemporary Chinese version of the Italian classic” that uses udon noodles instead of pasta and Iberico ham instead of bacon.

=== Title: The Top 10 Best Set Lunches in London (Plus 10 More if You’re Hungry) - Bloomberg ===

Lunch is tough for most London restaurants. While dining rooms are often packed for dinner, they are quieter during the day. 
That means chefs have to offer deals to entice us. Why resist? Here are 10 lunches to savor:
This informal restaurant in Shoreditch Town Hall, East London, is a destination for chefs from around the U.K. and overseas. It's so popular, you have to buy a ticket and pay in advance for dinner. Chef Isaac McHale is at the forefront of modern British cooking, using a few great ingredients to create memorable dishes. No need to pay upfront for the bargain lunch. It's 35 pounds for three courses and 65 pounds for five. 
 
Angela Hartnett is one of the U.K.'s best-loved chefs, known for her warm personality and unfussy Italian food. The new branch of Café Murano, in Covent Garden, looks great. Friendly service helps, but the seasonal food alone would probably keep you coming back. The set lunch may feature dishes such as risotto with peas and Berkswell cheese, and apricot tart with mascarpone. It's 16.50 pounds for two courses, 21 pounds for three. 
 
This is simply one of the finest lunches in London. Ollie Dabbous is gaining an international reputation for his creative gastronomy. The chef's restaurant in Fitzrovia has a stripped-down industrial look, so all your focus is on the plate. That's fine because his dishes easily withstand such scrutiny. Each is so well-balanced, the only wobble you are likely to get is from the table. The peas and mint is one of my favorite starters in London. Lunch is 35 pounds for four courses. 39 Whitfield Street, Fitzrovia, W1T 2SF; +44-20-7323-1544 or 
.
 
Simon Rogan is among Britain's finest chefs. It's unlucky for Londoners that his flagship L'Enclume is more than three hours away by train. It's worth the trip, but you can sample his seasonal cooking a little closer to home at Claridge's. The set lunch is great value, with dishes such as guinea hen with salt-baked celeriac, buttered kale, and cider sauce. It's 30 pounds for three courses. 
 
I like Gymkhana so much, I once ate at this Mayfair restaurant four times in a week, including twice on the same day. The set lunch is my favorite in London. Indian food isn't for everyone, but few could fail to appreciate Gymkhana's fine ingredients, precise cooking, and faultless spicing. My favorite meal is to get together with friends and order all five starter and main options on the lunch menu. Gymkhana can get very busy. It pays to book early. Lunch is 25 pounds for two courses, 30 pounds for three. 
 
This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in London for food, particularly the Sichuan dishes. Factor in the stunning views from Level 33 of the Shard and you are surely on to a winner. I often recommend Hutong, especially to people who tell me food isn’t good at restaurants with a view. And yet I hesitate to include the set lunch here because I'd rather go and order dim sum. The lunch is 35 pounds. 
 
This is a restaurant that for a few years might have been described as once-fashionable. No more. Following a refurbishment earlier this year, this Covent Garden institution is packed. It's buzzy, beautiful, and fun. The bar in the center of the room is one of the best places to sit, so don't feel short-changed if you end up there. The menu is eclectic, accessible, and inexpensive. The set lunch may include watermelon carpaccio with creamed feta; and sesame, Turkish delight, and pistachio coupe. It's 21.75 pounds for two courses and 26.25 pounds for three. 
 
Pierre Koffmann mentored countless chefs—including Marco Pierre White and Gordon Ramsay—at the three-Michelin-star La Tante Claire. These days he is cooking simpler food at his restaurant in the Berkeley, in Knightsbridge. But his focus on flavor is ever-present. He's in the kitchen on most weekdays, cooking the kind of food he learned to love as a child in southwest France. The set lunch includes dishes such as roasted rack and belly of pork with turnip gratin. It's 26 pounds for three courses. 
 
The Ritz restaurant is among the finest in London and also one of the most beautiful. It's unfortunate that more people don't get the chance to try chef John Williams's superb French cooking. The prices are slightly less scary than you might think. There's a three-course menu for 49 pounds. It's the wine list that is unforgiving, along with the dress code. This is the only restaurant I know in London where men must wear a tie. But it is worth it if you can get a table on the terrace on a summer's day. 
 
This grand brasserie—from the owners of the ultra-fashionable Wolseley—is dramatic. It looks like something out of an impressionist painting, with its high ceilings, marble pillars, brass rails, and large mirrors, and waiters scurrying across the room. The menu fits the bill, with all the usual brasserie favorites. But the real shock comes from the prices, which are low. The 
 menu is 9.75 pounds for two courses and 12.50 pounds for three; the Formule menu is 19.75 pounds for three courses, including a glass of wine, water, and coffee. 
After you run through the Top 10, here are 10 more to try:
 Chef Stevie Parle and his team make the butter and cure the meats in this new restaurant next to the O2 Centre. The set lunch is 28 pounds for three courses. 
 You may come for the views from the 28th floor of the Hilton on Park Lane and come back for the cooking of Joo Won. It's 28 pounds for two courses, 33 pounds for three. 
 The set lunch is magnificent and inexpensive: It includes wine and water as well as fine French cuisine. You may need to book as far as three months ahead; it is very popular. It costs 55 pounds. 43 Upper Brook Street, Mayfair, London, W1K 7QR; +44-20-7408-0881.
 This restaurant has been buzzing since Darroze was named the world's best female chef this year. Lunch in the beautiful and elegant dining room costs 30 pounds for two dishes, 38 pounds for three, and 45 pounds for four. 
 Claude Bosi is among the most creative chefs in the U.K. and the set lunch offers an introduction to his cooking. It's 49.50 pounds for three courses, including wine, coffee, and petits fours. 
 Brett Graham's West London restaurant is among the finest in the country. The lunch features dishes such as wild salmon with tomato, chardonnay, and shellfish butter. It's 50 pounds for four courses, including water. 
 This baby brother of Jason Atherton's Pollen Street Social is a charming bistro where Canadian chef Cary Docherty cooks up accessible dishes. Lunch is 21 pounds for two courses and 25 pounds for three. 
 This restaurant in an historic Soho building (where Karl Marx once lived) is a favorite with Londoners. They are drawn by chef Jeremy Lee's British dishes. The all-day Theatre Set menu is 18.50 pounds for two courses, 21.50 pounds for three. 
 With its baroque and quirky look, this is a dramatic venue. The gourmet lunch in the Lecture Room is 35 pounds for two courses, 40 pounds for three; both include coffee and petits fours.
 This is one of London's oldest restaurants and feels like it. The menu is traditional: It's like dining in a gentlemen's club. The lunch menu offers a roast from the carving trolley. It's 30 pounds for two courses and 38 pounds for three. 

=== Title: How to Pull Off Italian Dandy Style And Not Look Like a Jerk - Bloomberg ===

When it comes to dressing smart, nobody does it better than the Italians (my source on that fact: me). I purposely studied abroad in Florence to apprentice-by-osmosis the ways of the 
 (Italian for "ballers") who dressed up for no apparent reason. For them, just walking a hound down Via de’ Tornabuoni seemed to count as a high-style occasion.
This week, the entire world can get the same education during 
. The world’s preeminent menswear tradeshow brings together retailers, editors, and the most dapper men from around the globe to do business—and flaunt some serious besuited style in the streets (and on the Internet). And if you’re like me, you’re taking notes. 
But as much as you may admire it, the fashion at Pitti Uomo can be a bit intimidating. Sure, it looks great on Whippet-thin Italian dandies, some of whom spend hours each morning on their facial hair alone. But what about you, who have to go to an office and don't have the world's best tailors at your beck and call? Can you make this work in the real world?
The answer is: yes. With a few simple rules and outfits to emulate, almost anyone call pull off that plaids-and-patterns, sharper-than-a-razor Pitti look at home.  And Bloomberg Pursuits is here to help.
To compile these Pitti-style looks stateside, I teamed up with Suitsupply Madison Avenue, a great source for a wide variety of suiting and dress accessories. Tommy Ton, take note.
Two-piece suits are a dime a dozen, so if you show up in a three-piece rig like this, you'll already be ahead of the pack. (Bonus: Each component can be worn separately or together, so one three-piece suit means five different outfits.) Opt for color or, better yet, pattern. Since we are talking about Florence and not Wall Street this week, I paired this red-and-orange plaid suit with a denim shirt for a more casual vibe, while letting leather tassel loafers do some additional talking. (Double monkstraps are welcome, too.)
You didn’t think a pinstripe suit went with a check shirt and houndstooth tie? Yeah, neither did I at first. Some 99 percent of the time, mix-and-matching patterns won’t work out; but when it does, it’s magic. So go bold with your pinstripe suit—like this navy chalk-stripe number—pair it with a subdued shirt, and get playful with your tie and pocket square. A vintage-inspired timepiece like this Cartier Tank is a gentlemanly finishing touch.
A day won't go by at Pitti without at least two or three dozen double-breasted blazer sightings. I paired this flannel jacket with a chunky knit turtleneck in forest green and a plaid cuffed pant for that.
When you’re in the heart of Florence seeking new brands, trends, and menswear treasures, it’s OK to go a little 
, especially with the slimmed down silhouette of today’s military-inspired cargo pants. We matched a pair with a pinstripe vest and a houndstooth jacket. Mixing textures such as suede with flannel, wool, or tweed is often a subtle but handsome way to catch the eye.
The best part about a camel coat is that anything against it, be it a color (red, green) or pattern (argyle, herringbone), pops perfectly.

=== Title: How to Buy a Handbag for a Woman - Bloomberg ===

I've been told I'm hard to shop for. I get it, who wants to shop for a professional shopper? That would be like me offering professional tax accounting services to my mom, the CPA. (That sounds totally illegal, by the way, but you get my point.)
But then I realized by way of interaction with essentially every man I've ever encountered (bosses, hairdressers, fathers of friends, dudes at dinner parties) that this isn't a consequence of my choice of occupation; this is about the intimidation factor that comes along with being a lady. Most men are just straight-up clueless or terrified about making purchases that will please the females in their life—be it their wife, sister, or "no label" companion.  It seems they're happy to spend, but they want to do so smartly and successfully. 
The item I am asked most often from men for shopping advice on also happens to be the most beloved of all in a lady's wardrobe: the handbag. To which my first response is, "Well, is this purchase for purpose or pleasure—does she need it or just 
 it?"
You see, the first thing you should know, sirs, is that there is a difference between the versatile monstrosities we sling across our shoulders to help us schlep around our day-to-day necessities and the pretty little things we can fit in the palm of our hand when we change into a Cushnie et Ochs bodycon dress after dark. There's practical and there's impractical, and both make great gifts.
So, I've devised a shopping road map/cheat sheet to help get you in and out of the store with the right bag that perfectly suits her taste and lifestyle. You'll see it's really not that hard after all. (Says the professional shopper.)  
 
 

=== Title: How to Spend Up to $10,000 on a Watch - Bloomberg ===

You don't have to spend five figures to get a great watch. No matter what snobbish collectors might suggest, there are lots of incredible tickers out there for less than $10,000. Now, can you buy a flashy gold tourbillon in this price range? Yes, sure, but that doesn't mean you should.
When looking for a watch in this price range, there are a few things to keep in mind. You're almost certainly going to be buying a watch made of steel, your choice of complications is going to be more limited (sorry, no 
), and you'll be steering clear of Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet altogether. But that doesn't mean that you can't afford some incredible timepieces that are also good investments, and that you could even pass on to your children.
Here are the five types of watches you should be looking at to get the most watch for your money, all under $10,000.
If you're going to strap on the same watch every day, it needs to look good with both your Tuesday suit and your Sunday t-shirt, but you don't want it to be boring. The 
 ($6,900) handles all situations effortlessly and is packed with technology like a totally anti-magnetic movement and a more accurate and durable co-axial escapement. If you look closely at 
 ($9,050), you'll notice the seconds hand seems to tick like on a quartz watch, but this is because of a special gear-and-spring system inside that gives it the so-called "deadbeat seconds" for more precise timekeeping. Plus it's flat out beautiful. Cartier's in-house 
 ($6,750) is equally attractive and offers a modern update on one of the most classic watches of all time.
The modern 
 ($7,500) has almost become a cliche, since it can be spotted on countless wrists in nearly any bank or office around the world. But it's achieved this status for good reason: it's simply one of the best all-purpose watches you can buy. The black ceramic bezel, clean utilitarian dial, and bulletproof construction make it a near perfect choice for most people. If you're more a pilot watch kind of guy, IWC's latest, the 
 ($3,950) is the archetype on which all others are based.  The dial is as legible as they come and at 40mm it can even work as a dress watch on a slim leather strap. With all the work Panerai has done to keep innovating on both the design and technical fronts, it would be crazy not to mention the 
 ($9,100), which sports both Panerai's signature multi-layer dial and a manually-wound in-house movement.
For a few years now, Montblanc has been 
. A favorite, though, is the 
 ($5,900), which provides a full map of the northern hemisphere and shows what time it is across the globe all at once. It just got an update, so it now gives you a colorful interpretation of the world climate too. Baume & Mercier's elegant Clifton line has been another constant source of value, but the 
 ($4,990) is the most complicated version yet, adding a pair of complications without disrupting the midcentury lines and all-around handsomeness of the collection. If chronographs are more your speed, TAG Heuer makes the 
 ($5,250) entirely in-house and the openworked dial lets you admired the mechanics within. 
You pay for that "Swiss Made" signature on the dial of any watch. By looking outside Switzerland, you can sometimes get incredible value and interesting provenance to boot. One option is Japan, where Seiko is crafting its awesome 
 ($7,000). It tracks two timezones, comes both dressy and sporty versions, and is as well-made as anything from the Vallée de Joux. A little closer to Switzerland you'll find Glashütte, Germany, that country's top watchmaking hamlet. 
 ($3,840) starts with one of its quirkier designs and adds a brand new ultra-slim automatic movement that's made entirely in-house, all the way down to the escapement. Literally across the street, Glashütte Original is making its colorful 
 ($7,500) with textured and sunburst dials adding some whimsy to the Teutonic time-only watches. 
Vintage is where the real value is. For example, a solid 18k gold Rolex Day-Date on a solid gold President-style bracelet 
 while 
 of this watch would set you back over $30,000 at a boutique today. The sport watches get all the attention from vintage Rolex collectors, so these gold dress watches are still undervalued for the most part. Likewise, two legendary chronographs, the Omega Speedmaster Professional and the Heuer Carrera both get overlooked in favor of the much pricier Rolex Daytona. Even with the recent popularity of both models, awesome caliber 321 Speedmasters (
) and 
 with either two or three subdials both still fall squarely in this price bracket. Sure, you'll have to do some digging at dealers and auction houses to find one that's perfect for you, but you'll end up with a watch that punches far above its price class.

=== Title: Meet the Swedish Brewery That’s Changing the Way We Think About Craft Beer - Bloomberg ===

If you created a Venn diagram representing the worlds of beer and fashion, you’d be liable to get two nearly discrete circles, joined only by Swedish brewing team Omnipollo. Consisting of Henok Fentie (the liquid half, a longtime home brewer-turned pro) and Karl Grandin (the aesthetic half, co-founder of the popular Cheap Monday clothing brand), the like-minded duo has, in its short life, shaken up the craft market on both taste and visual fronts.
“Me and Karl work independently,” says Fentie. “I write recipes [and] brew and Karl creates art, yet we’re in constant conversation about what influences us at a specific time.”
The two crossed paths and began discussing the insular craft beer scene in Sweden and abroad. They both felt it needed to be recontextualized; in a sense, it needed to be made more fashionable in order to appeal to more people. A partnership, then, between a brewer and a designer made perfect sense. They began official production as Omnipollo
as in, “omnipotent” + “chicken”—in 2011.
Just three years later, the gypsy brewers (i.e., wanderers with no brewery of their own, instead utilizing the facilities of friends around the globe) were voted one of the Top 100 Brewers in the World by RateBeer.com.
Currently, the pair exports goods to roughly 20 markets, a number that's growing rapidly. “Our largest market after Sweden is the U.S., where we work very closely with our importer,” says Fentie. “Response there has been great, and we just came back from brewing in Pennsylvania [at Tired Hands Brewing Co.] and Oklahoma [at Prairie Artisan Ales].”
Fentie’s eclectic recipes have been key in Omnipollo’s success and its insistence on moving from niche to niche. Fan of bitter? Crisp? Fruity? Rich? Sour? They've got you covered. Then there’s the high-concept packaging, courtesy of Grandin, which includes such out-there efforts as 
, an imperial stout produced in collaboration with U.K.’s Buxton Brewery. Modeled after peanut butter biscuits but brewed without biscuits, butter, or peanuts, the bottle comes wrapped in white paper with nothing but two black dots above the beer’s name. It resembles, not unintentionally, a Ku Klux Klansman—a bold visual statement for a simple bottle of beer. The brewers offered the following in the commercial description: "Taste, enjoy, and don’t be prejudiced." 
“Karl [is] the most talented graphic mind in Sweden and, in my mind, the world,” says Fentie. “I think that [his] mind-bending artwork gave us extra lives whenever I went too far out on the experimental limb.”
Fentie and Grandin recently parlayed their momentum as gypsy brewers into a brick-and-mortar venture (an uncommon move), in the form of Omnipollos hatt (
). It’s a homey pizza bar in Stockholm forged in collaboration with Swedish outfit Pizzahatt. Offering "new-school" pies and an array of Omnipollo taps, the space itself almost resembles a 
-esque portal into the brain-space of its creators, featuring Grandin’s colorfully illustrative touches. “The idea is to put all our effort into the small stuff around these 10 taps, cleanliness, temperature, gas blend, pouring technique, glass care, etc. Ultimately providing an uncluttered and memorable beer experience,” says Fentie.
If you’re not in Sweden, or are simply unable to make a stop at Omnipollos hatt, the beers are pretty impossible to miss on a shelf if you reside in one of their distribution channels. (In the U.S., check their distributor’s website 1
 for availability.) Whether it’s their mango lassi-inspired 
 or 
, their bourbon barrel-aged stout with marshmallow and vanilla beans, the pair's creations are rare and exciting.

=== Title: Men’s Fashion Month Recap: Photos and Style Analysis From Europe - Bloomberg ===

Remember some 18 days ago when I felt the need to 
 to you guys? It was a doozy, I know, but we’ve come a long way since then (literally and metaphorically). Together we made it through our first tour of Europe in search of the best new fashion for men. (Four-word summary of the entire journey: Buy a big scarf.)
It was a privilege to be your eyes and ears in the market and the front (sometimes third) row. I hope you followed along as I shared my favorites in trends, collections, and fashion moments from London to Paris—by way of Florence and Milan. But if not, or you need a refresher, you can click through all our coverage below. Bookmark this page and come back and read at your leisure—you have until next August to master these trends.
London kicked things off with an impressive four days of fashion. I picked 
, 
 and 
 for best in show—but there was also a lot of undiscovered design talent there (like 
, remember that name). I also saw some recognizable names put on runway shows for the first time, like 
, and older brands, like 
, that returned to the schedule.
You can check out photos from many of the shows by clicking through the links below, but your key takeaway should be: 
.
Everywhere you look in Florence during the Pitti Uomo trade show, someone is showing off a different trend in men’s dressing. The city is taken over by dandified men, all wearing (and pulling off) madcap combinations of prints and patterns. They literally strut from their hotels to the Fortezza da Basso, for what is considered the season-defying event of men’s fashion month. (What, you’ve never heard of it?) This is where I saw trends like textured wool coats and knitwear (I’d even call them shlubby), autumnal jewel tones, and reversible outerwear. I expect to see much of this in the market next fall, and in your closet not long after that.
Your key takeaway here: 
.
There was a head-to-toe camel look by 
 from day one of Milan’s menswear week that I described as “easy luxury.” I’d like to extend that sentiment to the Milan collections as a whole. Designers from 
 to 
 all emphasized a new style of formalwear: dressing down to dress up. The result was a season of wearable fashions in rich colors and bold shapes. And scarves. Lots of scarves.
Key takeaway: 
Paris is always a global meet-up for clever dreamers. The designers who show there not only hail from the French capital but also from countries like Belgium and Japan. They often have a flair for the dramatic; their collections tend to feature flash over content. So while I appreciate their asymmetrical capes with drop crotch culottes, what I am 
looking for is clothing that real men (that’s you!) will actually wear. Surprisingly, Paris delivered that this season, in spades.
Key takeaway: 
 Case in point: The gorgeous 
 collection made me forget that another designer, 
, sent models down the runway with their balls hanging out.

=== Title: Kingsman Director Puts Movie's Clothes on Sale - Bloomberg ===

“A suit is a modern gentleman’s armor,” intones Colin Firth in the comedic espionage caper 
. “The Kingsman agents are the new knights.” Firth, playing the international superspy Harry Hart, is standing in a clubby Savile Row dressing room teaching a lesson in sartorial wisdom to his latest recruit, Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton). Soon, Eggsy will have his own bespoke outfit, including a George Cleverley shoe that hides a poison-tipped knife and a gold lighter that doubles as a hand grenade. With these, he will save the world. (Oops, sorry. Spoiler alert.)
Throughout 
, you may be distracted by the brogues, or the double-breasted suits, or even the eyeglasses and woven ties. You may also want to purchase them, which you can: Thanks to a partnership between the film’s director, Matthew Vaughn, and the e-commerce emporium Mr Porter, almost all the apparel and accessories you see on screen were made available online when the movie opened in the U.K. in January. If you love British tailoring—and you have $1,995 to spare—try Firth’s blue velvet dinner jacket. The knife shoes go for $950, blade not included. The Kingsman store from the film even briefly existed as a four-day pop-up at Huntsman, the Savile Row shop, where some scenes were shot.
It was Vaughn’s idea to turn the costumes into fashion. After making action flicks such as 
 and the 
 series, he started thinking about how a movie’s merchandising could be improved. It would be more fun, he thought, to own a cinematic spy’s actual wardrobe than some action-figure facsimile. So he approached Natalie Massenet, founder of Mr Porter’s parent brand, Net-a-Porter. Then he and costume designer Arianne Phillips worked with Mr Porter’s buyers to create a real version of the film’s fictional haberdashery.
“If [the fashion] hadn’t been integral to the film, then I would have been suspicious,” says Toby Bateman, buying director for Mr Porter. But some of the partner labels, such as Turnbull & Asser, which sells $350 oxford-cloth dress shirts, were in the original script. After brands like T&A made garments for the actors to wear on screen, it was easy to persuade them to sign on for the Kingsman line, Bateman says.
Every item comes from a heritage U.K. manufacturer. Vaughn himself wears lots of niche British brands, so he suggested including things such as $150 driver’s caps from Lock & Co. and $2,995 Swaine Adeney Brigg briefcases. It all looks masculine and enviable on Firth, Egerton, and the rest—and it holds up in a fight.
As a costume designer, Phillips is best known for her work on 
, which, although it was directed by fashion designer Tom Ford, had no retail tie-in. “Being included into any kind of merchandising has never really been part of a conversation that costume designers have been invited into,” she says. On-set artisans usually don’t have rights to their creations after a movie is made. 
 opportunity was a way for Phillips to retain control of her creative work—and to see how regular men might wear her looks. While Vaughn and Mr Porter share in the profit from the clothing line, Phillips is getting paid to design the collection for this season and next. Sales have been strong so far, Bateman says, and the line will continue whether or not the movie has a sequel.
The film itself is less well-thought-out. Eggsy is a plucky ne’er-do-well whose father, a Kingsman, was killed in one of his first missions. Years later, Harry nominates Eggsy when there’s an opening for the spy gang. There are fun training sequences and plenty of those amusing Bondian innovations (the umbrella also doubles as a gun). Then the movie devolves into an extended confrontation with a tech magnate—played by a mincing Samuel L. Jackson—who’s bent on destroying humanity to save the planet. At times the film functions as a class parable, with debts to
. At other moments, it’s a weak political satire.
Most of 
 plays out as a standard suits-and-spies flick. But as a director, Vaughn’s best known for his violent fight sequences. So when those come—and they do, with guts and glee—they’re startling and over-the-top. By the time the film is over, you’ll wish you were back at the tailor shop of the earlier scenes, surrounded by all the beautiful expensive suits.

=== Title: How Social Media Boosted Menswear During the Fall Collections - Bloomberg ===

By the time 
—which kicks off Monday, Feb. 1—rolls around, fans of fashion tend to be ready for a bit of a social media cleanse.
The global menswear shows began in London in early January, and ever since, every fashion editor, clothing brand, and "Instagram influencer" has been posting blurry runway shots of models stomping too quickly past—or carefully posed pictures of themselves wearing the latest styles. Social media have truly become central to fashion marketing, and it's gotten a little overwhelming. 
In part, this is because such networks as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat have helped fashion houses thrive. The direct connection between a designer and his or her fans is great for brand loyalty, and as millennials have come to trust what's in the feeds in their phones more than what they see in advertisements, a robust presence on those platforms is necessary for a brand to stay relevant. 
This is a change from the past—accessibility was not usually a key tenet of luxury fashion. According to James Lovejoy, a content researcher at 
, a social media analytics company, a lot of luxury fashion brands have been timid in the past about engaging in social media because they wanted to retain a tight, controlled grip on their branding. But, he says, "whether consciously entering the social fray or not, fashion brands have been brought into this highly public space. And now, through the power of social media, massive audiences can access their fashion shows in nearly real time. And that may or may not be in the control of the brand."
But lately, as they rush to catch up with the future, the brands that show at fashion week have gone to extremes to use social media more creatively when it comes to showing their collections. Last fall, Burberry gave a sneak peek of its full womenswear collection on Snapchat the day before the official show. Gucci often puts its looks up on Instagram at the moment they make their debut on the runway.
"Fashion shows have always been fantasy visual experiences; I wouldn’t argue that the idea has changed," says Justin Berkowitz, Bloomingdale’s men’s fashion director. "What perhaps has evolved is the frequency. Many designers seem increasingly focused on how the collection and experience of their show translates in social media. More and more often, designers use elaborate sets or highly designed runways to create an interesting environment around their collection. When these elements help tell the story of a collection innately, it works beautifully, but sometimes the connection is only tangential.”
In Milan, Paris, and London this month, we saw some especially edgy efforts that have us wondering what we'll see at the New York menswear shows in early February and the womenswear collections that follow shortly after.
Here are five brand moments from the just-wrapped European collections that moved the needle for future social media experiments. 
Huh!? That was the general reaction that could be heard from around the fashion media in early January when we received a press release from the public relations firm 
 stating that the designer 
, the darling of 
, would be livestreaming his show for the very first time exclusively on … 
.
Yes, 
 
—the all-male social networking app that is used primarily by gay men to "connect" with other gay men nearby. Anderson has a reputation for the unexpected, but no one saw that puzzling, unconventional partnership coming (except maybe PR Consulting, as the firm currently represents both brands).
According to Anderson, the brand is always on the lookout “for ways to push boundaries when it comes to gender and aesthetic.” The fashions in his collections (polka-dot furs, cropped tops, and knitted track pants) are certainly proof of that. But was aligning his young and lesser-known brand with a hookup app for gay men a risky or ingenious move? After all, anyone who is not a gay man seeking companionship, but who wanted to watch the show, would have had to download a slightly seamy new app to his phone.
Here’s how it worked: Grindr’s 7 million users (across 192 countries) were directed from the app to a digital destination where the video was shown live, then on a continuous loop for 24 hours following. According to Grindr, the show drew viewership in the hundreds of thousands, about a third of them during the live event (which would have been around 5:00 a.m. EST). J.W. Anderson's normal group of buyers is quite small, so this stunt may have exposed it to a whole new audience—though whether those viewers will remember the experience when the clothes become available in eight months is not quite a sure thing. 
Call it a strategic partnership or a PR gimmick, but whatever it was, it was pretty brilliant. In what was the most memorable moment of the entire three-week-long European show calendar, a 21-year-old from Chino, Calif., named 
 
 when he showed up as an invited guest at the 
 show. Never heard of him? Neither had most of the fashion editors and buyers in attendance at the show. But we certainly know him now, and we’re still talking about him, and thus the show, which was the whole point of the spectacle, really.
See, Dallas is a self-created social media star with a collective 20 million followers across such platforms as Instagram and 
. For comparison’s sake, that’s more followers than fashion folk such as Karl Lagerfeld, Karlie Kloss, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren have on Instagram, alone … combined. One image of 
 recieved 111,000 likes (that’s more than snaps posted of female influencers such as 
 and blogger 
).
This helps a brand such as Calvin Klein in particular, because in addition to the expensive runway clothes that wealthy shoppers can buy in upscale department stores, a huge part of the company's bottom line comes from fragrances, $28 sports bras, and cotton boxer briefs that are affordable to Dallas's young fans. Calvin Klein is speaking the language of its desired millennial (and even younger) consumer.
This is after CK launched its 
 campaign in 2014, which has become one of the most successful digitally driven campaigns in the industry—expanding the brand’s social media following by the 
. (They can thank 
 for that one, too.)
If Calvin Klein was going for maximum impact, they nailed it. "That moment created an incredible sense of excitement—and chaos—outside the show venue," says Berkowitz, who was a guest of the show. "It made me think about what it must have been like when the Beatles hit town.”
But how truly valuable is creating a viral moment like this to a brand that is ultimately in the business of selling luxury clothing? “It really depends on a brand's goals," says Lovejoy, who stresses that social metrics aren't always the most acurate. "If Calvin Klein was trying to get [its] name in front of as many people as [it] possibly could, then a PR stunt like that will probably help rack up those social numbers. But I think brands should always question whether they're actually building advocates or just going for mass likes—and not seeking the most influential and beneficial audience.”
 is widely regarded as a pioneer when it comes to fusing fashion and technology. Beyond the British brand's very active global audience—it has 38 million followers across 19 platforms—it has successfully partnered with such platforms as 
 (which generated 200 million views of its spring/summer 2016 womenswear collection), 
, 
, and 
.
This season, for its 
, it teamed up with 
 to become the first luxury brand to broadcast a fashion show live on the platform. (It were also the first to have its own channel on 
.) Burberry won't disclose Apple viewership metrics, but nearly 40,000 people have watched the full 17-minute runway show on their 
 channel. 
 
Fans of the brand can still download the Burberry app and rewatch the current and past runway collections, get beauty tutorials, and gain access to the talent of emerging British musicians, such as 
—who provided the haunting soundtrack for the show. His live performance alone, on the morning after the world lost 
, is worth the download.
The Italian duo 
 decided to embrace the culture of selfies (see: model Lucky Blue Smith's 
) and had its models actually pucker and pose with iPads in hand while strutting down the runway (in 
 and silk, horseshoe-shaped pajama sets, no less).
Guests in the front row were also included in the fun, as the models turned the lenses on them occasionally during the Sicily-meets-Spaghetti Western collection. The resulting show-within-the-show, what the designer's dubbed Short Movie by The Models, appeared live online using the hashtag 
.
Also, before entering or exiting the show, the photo opp-happy crowd was encouraged to Instagram themselves with a Western-themed cardboard photo stand-in, complete with cowboys and saloon barmaids. How do you say yee-haw in Italian?
While designer Riccardo Tisci presented his fall 2016 
 collection—billed as his most dapper and wearable menswear showing to date—this past weekend in Paris, his current 
 made its debut by way of an Instagram-only campaign in a partnership with 
.
The luxury retailer enlisted the creative guidance of a social media provocateur, the artist 
 (known via his popular Instagram handle 
), to curate a series of images with photographer by 
. The result was a restrained (for Abraham) and tasteful click-to-buy lookbook called Seeing Stars
which was introduced exclusively on 
 to its nearly 72,000 followers.
While the series didn't receive as much attention (likes) as Abraham's more boundary-pushing content, according to Barneys, it is very pleased with the results—and reports a threefold lift in traffic on Instagram, as well as a 50-percent increase in searches for Givenchy on Barneys.com. "The goal of this campaign and the reason why it resonated with our audience was because we were able add to the men's fashion conversation, not just report on what most people are covering,” says Chris Martinez, a vice president and digital creative director at Barneys New York. “Our audience is always interested in our perspective, and through this collaboration we were able to really showcase this collection in a way that was unique and relevant."
 
 
 

=== Title: Portuguese Food Is About to Take London, Courtesy of Chiltern Firehouse Chef - Bloomberg ===

Nuno Mendes is one of the quiet men of the London restaurant world. He's shy and self-effacing: good-natured but intensely serious about cooking and food.
It's one of life's mysteries—up there with the 
 and the precise purpose of Stonehenge—how he came to be executive chef at the 
, a celebrity hangout where so much air is kissed, you end up breathing in lipstick.
He is a talented and creative chef who wants to please diners more than he wants to be admired.
Even as he explores the outer edges of the culinary universe (as he did at 
, the Loft Project, and Viajante), he remembers that eating out is about pleasure.
(I believe that's why he was chosen for Chiltern Firehouse, but then I thought Qatar 
 the World Cup because of its excellent climate and footballing traditions, so I am not entirely confident that all my theories are correct.)
Anyway, Mendes is returning to his Portuguese roots at 
, his fine new brasserie at Old Spitalfields Market, where he celebrates the produce, the wines, the cooking, the flavors, and the hospitality of his homeland.
Portugal is one of Europe's most underappreciated countries, in culinary terms. The cuisine, little-known in London, is likely about to become fashionable. Taberna do Mercado is very good.
The room is simply furnished with wooden tables and chairs, and bare walls. It's unfussy, like the food. Taberna do Mercado is a neighborhood restaurant that happens to be in East London—where Mendes is a longtime resident—but might be in Lisbon.
A good way to start a meal is with a cheese such as Queijaria Simoes DOP from Azeitao. This is handmade from sheep's milk. It's soft and creamy and mild without being bland. I don't know that I have ever tried this before, and I am now wondering if I have squandered years eating brie and other French cheeses. It's 7 pounds ($10.65) for a half cheese, 14 pounds for a whole one.
The cured meats are also a great advertisement for Portugal. Hands up, who has even heard of paleta porco preto? It's 14 pounds for 70 grams (2.7 ounces). This acorn-fed black pig did not die in vain. Its deep and meaty flavor lives on.
Among the snacks, the runner-bean fritters and bulhao pato stand out. The beans are lightly battered and are served with a traditional Portuguese clam sauce with fried garlic, lemon juice, and coriander. The earthy flavor of the beans marries with the sharpness of the sauce for a little thrill.
Another option is prawn rissois, a traditional Portuguese bar snack of mashed prawns in a deep-fried pastry shell. It's best served with a glass of beer that is lightly chilled.
But my own favorites on the menu are the two sandwiches: beef prego, prawn paste, and wild garlic; and pork bifana, yeast mayo, and fennel. The Madeira island bread is made with sweet potato and flour and is cooked on a skillet like a muffin.
Something like this rests on the quality of the ingredients and the seasoning. The beef prego—a traditional Portuguese favorite—is filled with thick-cut slices of rare roast meat whose flavor is brought out by the piquant paste and the garlic. It is not a polite and timid snack. It means business.
Other dishes are more challenging. Mendes is proudest of his house-tinned fish dishes. An original idea was to serve bought-in cans of fish but he decided he could do it better, with options such as cockles with wild garlic and lemon.
And the wines? Years ago, I was invited to help judge a wine tasting in Lisbon. Despite my name, and decades of Bacchanalian excess, I am inexperienced in such things. Having dribbled twice while trying to spit the stuff out—something new for me—I decided the safest option was to swallow.
We tasted almost 40 before lunch.
Having drunk my way round Portugal in a single morning, I can say that the list at Taberna do Mercado contains many delights.
Fortunately, more than 20 of the options are available by the glass, so you can try a few, or replicate half my morning. The house wines (at 22 pounds a bottle) are perfectly drinkable; the Quinta da Baseira, Tinto Bom 2005, Vinho Verde—a natural white wine—is worth the 48 pounds if you are feeling flush.
There are just three desserts, of which the most interesting is pao de lo, a moist—almost wet—sponge cake made with olive oil. It's good with coffee.
Taberna do Mercado is as low-key as Chiltern Firehouse is high. But you may still have trouble getting in. It's already busy at lunchtimes, and no reservations are accepted at night.
Taberna do Mercado is at Old Spitalfields Market, 107b Commercial Street, E1 6BG; http://www.tabernamercado.co.uk/ or info@tabernamercado.co.uk for reservations.

=== Title: Baselworld 2016: Six Watches That Truly Surprised Us - Bloomberg ===

At this year’s 
, there are a lot of new watches. Such brands as Rolex, Tag Heuer, Patek Philippe, Casio—and everything in between—introduce thousands and thousands of new timepieces to buyers, clients, and journalists. Most of them are not that exciting. But in 2016 there are a few watches that stand out for their impressive engineering and ambitious design. They aren’t all incredibly expensive or even flashy, they're just good and represent where the industry should be going. Here are six I liked.
 
This was the most unique watch I saw at Baselworld. Designed to look like the deck of a wooden schooner with a boom that sweeps across to indicate the minutes of the hour, it is the kind of watch your friends would immediately ask you about—and beg to play with. Ultra-thin fiber nanowires control the boom; they are thinner than a hair but can carry more than a kilo worth of weight. (The hour is displayed in numerals at the 12 o’clock, and a tourbillon sits at 6 o’clock.) The power reserve in the Christophe Claret-designed movement is 52 hours, the case is 18K white gold, and only 18 pieces will be made. It will retail for $280,000.
 
The amazing thing about this watch is that when you put it on, it just looks like a handsome, comfortable, distinguished boardroom watch. But it actually represents a huge achievement for a jewelry brand that, 10 years ago, was not considered a competitor in the world of haute horologie. Since that time, Bulgari has moved all its work in house, from dials to cases to movements, and it has garnered a lot of esteem along the way. The Octo Finnissimo is the world’s thinnest minute repeater; at 6.85 mm, it is thinner than an iPhone 6. It’s made of titanium, so it weighs only 43 grams and resonates a lovely sound that’s better than it would have been if it were steel or gold. Only 50 will be made; price is $155,000.
 
Not every watch on this list is going to have a mechanical movement; companies that are making quartz watches at much more affordable price points are also doing interesting things to try and impress consumers. Here, Bulova has created the world’s first curved chronograph movement. It’s a handsome watch that was cleverly designed—all the pieces in the movement have to be built curved, too, not just the base plate. The curve means it fits the wrist extremely well and will tuck right under your dress shirt nicely. At $799 in stainless steel and $899 in ultra-light titanium, it is a very accessible model. You can get it in stores now.
 
This watch is crazy. Like, "What is happening on my wrist? How could I ever afford this? Do I live in 
?" crazy. It has what Jacob & Co. calls a twin-turbo tourbillon on a double-axis movement. Opposite the tourbillon is the hours and minutes indicator, and on the other axis is the seconds indicator. At the center of the movement is a globe that tells you whether it’s day or night, and on the baseplate is a ring that tells you the sidereal time, which is the time relative to the stars (instead of the sun). A slim rose-gold ring will show you what constellations you should be able to see in the northern hemisphere right now. It’s 47 mm wide and quite high—you would have to wear it as a statement bracelet rather than anything you could try to squeeze under a cuff. Fewer than 25 per year will be made, and depending on materials, the price could range from $540,000 to $800,000. (Pictured is the rose-gold case.)
 
You may know Citizen as a decades-established maker of solar-powered quartz movements and watched over the years as its timepieces have become more elegant, more subtle, and more ambitious. The Eco-Drive is worth talking about because it is the world’s thinnest light-powered watch. The whole thing is just 2.98 mm thick, and the movement itself is just 1 mm. It feels like nothing on the wrist and looks like an optical illusion. Plus, the solar mechanism will hold a charge for eight months in the dark. Citizen will make only 800 of them, and they will retail for $6,000.
 
Outside the dramatic Hublot booth at Baselworld was a display with an all-sapphire Hublot LaFerrari, its halo watch, which retails for $575,000. (Obviously, that one’s aimed at Ferrari fans, being named after the marque’s million-dollar supercar.) But downstairs in the bowels of the showroom, I got to play with the MP-07, which takes some of the ideas behind the LaFerrari and transforms them into a new, slightly more affordable watch. The MP-07 also has a verticalized movement (if you peer into a round convex lens on the side, you can see the tourbillon at work) and is also designed to be easily read while driving a car. The minutes and hours are at the bottom left, while the seconds are on the upper right, and the power reserve is at bottom right. The watch has a remarkable 42-day power reserve and comes with a very intense winding box, if that’s your thing. It will retail for $276,000.

=== Title: 14 Valentine's Day Gifts She'll Love (That Aren't Chocolate or Flowers) - Bloomberg ===

I get it. It seems as if you just conquered the gift-giving season, and here it is again: Valentine's Day—and with it, more gift-giving decisions that must be made for the missus or the lady friend in your life.
I’m here to tell you that we women do not need, or even want, cheesy lip-shaped tchotchkes, a bundle of carnations, or a stale box of drugstore chocolates. Shocking, right? So here's a tip: It’s time to trade in that plush teddy bear attached to a giant mylar balloon for something more personalized. And permanent.  
With that in mind, I’ve rounded up 14 stylish, no-fail gifts, at a mix of price points, to suit just about every taste. And here is my most important piece of advice: Don't forget the card. (Herein, it really is the thought that counts, but don't get a cheesy Hallmark missive. Write something simple and sweet, and buy an elegant, special card at a place such as 
, 
 or 
.) 
We might be modern iPhone 6s-toting women, but we can still appreciate the delicate beauty (and purpose) of a timeless wristwatch such as this gold-plated, lizard-strapped one by Swedish minimalists 
 
Never underestimate how much we like to be wrapped up in luxury. This versatile, cotton Turkish robe by 
 
 will help her escape at home, or serve as the perfect seaside coverup. 
Sometimes simple and sweet is best. Stud earrings, such as this mismatched pair by

=== Title: The Best New Watches at Baselworld 2016 - Bloomberg ===

The annual 
 is for international luxury watch brands to show off the timepieces they are going to sell in the coming year. It’s a chance for buyers, private clients, social media stars, and journalists to sort through thousands of pieces with wildly different materials, complications, and mechanics and decide which is worth trumpeting or selling.
This year, many brands are showcasing a lower price point of watches to 
. There is also a fair number of super-expensive timepieces the delight major collectors who chase the limited editions put out by high-end brands. I’ve seen dozens and dozens of watches by now, and quite a few weak gimmicks (New wristbands! Slightly larger faces!) in the days since the fair opened to press on March 16. But here are seven watches I’m pretty sure watch nerds will be rushing to buy this coming year.
 
Fellow journalists were practically drooling to touch this new Daytona Rolex upon its debut; it’s always a big deal to Rolex fans when there is a new model of a beloved classic. The last new Daytona was released way back in 2000, and while this stays true to 
s (and the famous 
) with its black subdials and bezel, there are enough new updates to please fans. There’s a new material on the bezel, Cerachrom, with is a Rolex proprietary material that is extra scratch- and UV-resistant. The numbers around the bezel also read in a different direction (in a circle, rather than all horizontal). It has a 72-hour power reserve and self-winding 4130 movement, and it will set you back $12,200.
 
The ref. 5930 is a totally new movement from Patek, and its first-ever worldtimer chronograph. Inspired by a watch from the 1940s that is currently in the Patek Philippe Museum, this piece is also the thinnest and smallest worldtimer chronograph on the market. It has a 50-hour power reserve, 38 jewels, and a diameter of 33 m. It will retail for $73,000.
 
The “OT” in the name of this watch stands for Oracle Team, the America’s Cup sailing squad that Bremont sponsors—which explains the regatta countdown complication at 12 o’clock on the face. The bezel is coated in luminescent paint, which creates a dramatic look at night, and each of the 235 units created will actually have a chunk of carbon fiber from an America’s Cup-winning boat embedded in the crown. It will retail for $6,895.
 
There will only be 18 pieces of this watch made by the mad geniuses at MB&F, six in each of three color stylings. It’s an update of 2015’s HMX watch, which was inspired by the twin-engine format of a supercar. But in this version, designer James Thompson (also known as 
) lent a specially designed luminescent paint, which is more powerful, longer lasting, and brighter than any other lume on the market. It will retail for $50,000.
 
Every year Tag Heuer releases a new watch inspired by a vintage piece in its museum. This year, it came up with the Monza, a 42 mm chronograph with a black titanium case. It was modeled after a watch made 40 years ago, also called the Monza, after the Formula 1 track in Italy where in 1975 Niki Lauda solidified his World Championship win. In 1976, Jack Heuer gave the watch to the Ferrari F1 team, which is why you’ll note this version has the old Heuer logo (without the Tag). It will be made in a limited edition and cost $5,200.
 
In general this year, Zenith is aiming to lower the prices of its watches 12 percent to deal with currency inconsistencies around the globe. It looks like the sweet spot will fall somewhere below $10,000. But that doesn’t mean it has given up on pricier baubles—it is making 150 of the El Primero Skeleton Tourbillon, which is a skeletonized version of its popular El Primero. The 45-mm watch will be sold starting in November 2016 for $46,000.
 
The Speedmaster Master Chronograph from Omega is getting a moonphase indicator this year, and Omega (with its 
) went all out with it. The face of the moon is mother of pearl, but it is decorated according to photographs of the moon provided by NASA—and if you look at it closely with a loup, you can see the company has added Neil Armstrong’s famous first footprint from the Apollo 11 mission. The watch will start at $7,140 and go up in price depending on colors and materials.

=== Title: Manhattan Luxury-Home Prices in a Slide, Defying Broader Market - Bloomberg ===

Manhattan’s luxury-home market is losing its luster.
The median price for the borough’s most-expensive homes fell to $3.59 million in October, down 2.2 percent from a year earlier, according to an index by 
 measuring resales in the top 20 percent of the market. Prices have been dropping every month since February, when they reached their highest point on record, a median of $3.72 million, an analysis of data from the listings website shows.
“There has been a continuous decline for eight months and I’m comfortable calling that a peak,” Alan Lightfeldt, a data scientist at StreetEasy, said in an interview. “The downward trend in that decline hasn’t abated, and we haven’t seen it wavering in any way.”
Prices for luxury homes are moving in the opposite direction from the broader Manhattan market, where values are still rising and 
. New York’s high-end inventory has ballooned in recent years as developers focused on building large and lavish units in an appeal to 
, who now appear to be more hesitant to buy. Listings for more moderately priced homes, meanwhile, haven’t been replenished because the high cost of land makes building in that range unprofitable, and owners are reluctant to sell because they can’t afford to trade up.
The result is a pool of listings that’s light on the properties that more people want to buy, Lightfeldt said. In the third quarter, the supply of homes for sale in the top fifth of the the market rose more than in any other segment, jumping 8.9 percent to 4,055 units, according to StreetEasy. For the other four levels combined, listings declined more than 3 percent.
The Federal Reserve, in its December 
 of regional economic conditions, noted the same bifurcation in the New York market, citing a “supply glut” of high-end homes and slackening buyer demand for them. The top price tier was also the only one in which sellers as a group didn’t get their full asking price in the third quarter, StreetEasy data show.
“Every asset has a threshold in pricing and once you push past it, you’re going to see the buyers resist,” said Donna Olshan, president of Olshan Realty Inc. and author of a weekly 
 on the New York luxury market.
Olshan, who defines luxury as units listed for at least $4 million, described having had four good sales weeks out of the past four months, with prospective buyers choosing to pause rather than submit to ever higher prices.
“We have a lot of overpriced apartments on the market and that’s the reason for a slowdown,” said Olshan, who said she believes the market has plateaued rather than peaked. “Tremendous overpricing means that marketing periods are longer, and the people who are overpriced are going to have to correct.”
Sellers are already adjusting their expectations. 
 plans to “
” to move the 30 remaining condominiums at 400 Park Ave. South, a tower it completed last year, Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley said on a 
 earlier this month. The builder will also be “a bit more aggressive in pricing” at 1110 Park Ave., where five of the nine units hadn’t found buyers, he said.
A three-bedroom 
 at 400 Park Ave. South was marked down by 4 percent this month to $5.75 million, according to the listing on StreetEasy. At 1110 Park Ave., the asking price for the 7,000-square-foot (650-square-meter) 
 was cut 10 percent last week to $31.5 million.
At 
’s One57, the skyscraper near Carnegie Hall that ignited the high-end construction boom, the initial buyer of a 51st-floor apartment is 
 his unit at a loss, according to StreetEasy. The owner, who bought the 3,466-square foot condo in April for $20.4 million, listed it for sale about a week later for $21.9 million, then dropped the asking price in October to a little less than $19 million. The home went into contract last week, according to StreetEasy.
Extell and HFZ Capital Group’s Ziel Feldman are among developers that have said they’re 
 with their upcoming projects as a way of satisfying a shortage in Manhattan.
The luxury market “has been over-served and the demand seems to be fully satiated,” said Lightfeldt of StreetEasy. The firm’s price index is based on a representative sampling of resales in a given month, which are compared to their previous sales prices.
Demand for the most-expensive homes has also been dimmed by the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar, gyrations in the Chinese stock market and a losing year for 
, Olshan said.
“You take all of those factors and you sprinkle them onto a real estate market that was overpriced to begin with, and you’re going to feel it,” she said.

=== Title: London Gunpowder New Curry Restaurant Beats Brick Lane - Bloomberg ===

is just a block away from London's famous Brick Lane curry-houses, yet this new Indian café is a world away in quality.
It's the creation of a young entrepreneur from Kolkata, Harneet Baweja, and of chef Nirmal Save, formerly of the 
 in his hometown of Mumbai, and of 
 and 
in London.
It's a tiny place near Spitalfields Market that seats just 28. The menu is short, a total of 20 items (including starters, mains, sides and desserts) chalked on a blackboard on the exposed-brick wall. The décor is minimal: The bar is constructed from old chairs, and the light shades are upcycled stainless-steel serving bowls.
The menu starts with one of the finest creations - rasa ke bomb - a deconstructed masala dosa, where the potato-filled crepe is reduced to a bite-sized crisp atop a shot glass of a hot-and-sour broth. It's £2.50 ($3.55).
You might expect the chutney cheese sandwich (£4.50)  to be similarly innovative but it is pleasantly retro - an Indian croque monsieur spiced with onions, capsicum and seeded chilis, topped with a mint and coriander chutney. It is tangy and sharp and meltingly delicious.
The Kashmiri lamb chops (£5 apiece) are among my favorites on the pan-Indian menu. They have a crispy char and pink middle, and the spicing accentuates the flavor of the meat rather than felling it with a chili kick. These are chops to match those of 
and 
, two East London giants of the food of the Indian Subcontinent.
Delicately flavored mustard fish steamed in banana leaf (£7) and saag with tandoori paneer (cheese and spinach) at £11 are two good options free of red meat, as are the Porzhi okra fries. There are plenty of vegetarian options. But my other must-go dish is Aunty Sulu's wild-rabbit pulao, based on a recipe from Save's mother, from the countryside outside Mumbai.
The meat is cooked on the bone and served with basmati rice spiced with clove and cardamom, and served with cranberries for sweetness and color. It's smoky, soft and rich. Desserts include an Indian imagining of bread-and-butter pudding, served with Old Monk rum, and molten spice chocolate cake.
Baweja's first job was in the kitchen at a hotel in Kolkata, while his family's business enterprises gave him the chance to travel around India. He studied at the 
, in Manila, before working in finance.
Gunpowder joins other small restaurants in London such as 
and 
, serving modern Indian dishes that are lighter than the traditional recipes that inspired them and yet big on flavor and spicing.
I'm visiting India next month. I only hope the food will be this inventive.

=== Title: London’s Top 10 Hotel Bars: The Quirky, Cool and Glamorous - Bloomberg ===

London is home to many fabulous hotel bars. They are not just for tourists: Londoners recognize the best of them as great for cocktails and a quiet drink.
Here are my top 10.
This is probably the most famous bar in London. Its Art Deco elegance takes you back to another age. (Only the prices bring you back to the present day.) It's a fine place to sip a martini and listen to the jazz pianist who plays each night. This was one of the first bars in Europe to serve American-style cocktails. The downside of its celebrity is that it can be difficult to get a table. And yes, this is popular with tourists. 
 
This discreet bar has been named 
 for three years in a row. There's an edge to the understated styling and a cheeky cocktail list, with options such as Your Room or Mine, and Bedroom Escapades. Head bartender Alex Kratena has won several awards, including personality of the year and international bartender of the year. Many guests are regulars, including executives from the neighboring BBC. I only wish they would ban men wearing shorts. Who wants to see that? 
 
You come here for the martinis as countless others have before you for decades. Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, may have found his inspiration at Dukes for the line, "Shaken, not stirred." This is a traditional luxury hotel bar in St. James, filled with elegant people. While jacket and tie are not required, it's a good idea to dress up. Leisurewear is not permitted. (Eat my shorts.) 
 
This hotel is the baby sister of the Dorchester. Where that famous hotel is more traditional, 45 Park Lane feels younger. It's home to Cut by Wolfgang Puck, which serves some of the best steaks in London. The bar is reached by a staircase from the lobby. You can sit at a long counter or hang out in a lounge at the back. The snacks are by Puck. Bar 45 has an international hotel feel and might not be for everyone. But the drinks are well made, and this is the best on Park Lane. 
 
This is one of my favorite bars in Europe. Its Art Deco look (by the late David Collins) is very glamorous, as are the uniforms of the staffers. This room is hidden away at the back of the hotel. Many out-of-towners go no further than the Coburg Bar at the front, giving the Connaught Bar an ambience of quiet exclusivity. Best of all is the martini trolley, where the barman mixes your drink tableside. 
 
This hotel is housed in the former town hall of Bethnal Green, a working-class area of East London that is only now making the transition to fashionability. The ornate building, which first opened in 1910, is part of the attraction: You can almost smell the history. The bar is as quirky as the original cocktails. If that's not enough, the Typing Room restaurant is across the hallway. 
 
You have to know where this bar is to find it, and you need to book in advance to get in. That may help explain why the Punch Room is so popular with celebrity visitors to this Ian Schrager hotel in Fitzrovia. The oak-paneled room is inspired by 19
 century private clubs. There's a choice of 10 punches. The London Edition also houses the fashionable Berners Tavern restaurant, so you can make a real night of it—if you get a table. 
 
This quiet and pretty room is little known, even among Londoners. It's hidden away at the hotel, though the windows look right out onto Knightsbridge. Many of the guests are from overseas, and the Rosebery is particularly popular with women. Afternoon tea is served, and it's a good place to stop off after shopping at Harvey Nichols. But I go for the Champagne and the sake. It all feels very serene. Go downstairs to Bar Boulud if you want to get lively. 
 
Chiltern Firehouse is one of the toughest restaurants in London to get table. But even if you snag one, that doesn’t get you into the Laddershed at the back of the hotel. The bar is effectively invitation only, and one is unlikely to be forthcoming unless you are Kate Moss or another A-Lister. (If you are, please invite me.) Don't despair: The bar opens onto an outdoor terrace that is open to mortals, and this is one of London's most lovely places to drink on a summer's day. 
, 1 Chiltern Street, Marylebone, W1U 7PA; +44-20-7073-7676 (good luck)
 
The first thing you notice is the eccentric design. The lounge looks like a Victorian drawing room, cluttered with bric-a-brac. There's a stuffed kangaroo wearing boxing gloves and a domestic cat in a dress. You can lounge on mismatched old couches and drink innovative cocktails by Tony Conigliaro. It's a hipster crowd as befits the hotel's location, in fashionable Clerkenwell. But the welcome is friendly, not too cool for school. This is one of London's oddest hotel bars. I'm a regular. 
, 49-50 St John's Square, London EC1V 4JJ; +44-20-7324-4545
 

=== Title: Men’s Fashion Is Headed for a Gender-Bending Moment Unseen Since the ’70s - Bloomberg ===

In January, 
 menswear runway collection was an eye-opener. It wasn’t because the brand had just fired its nearly decadelong creative director Frida Giannini in December, or even because new designer Alessandro Michele had pulled the clothing together in less than a week in his new role.
It was because the men on the runway looked ... like women. 
In fact, some of them 
 women—an increasing trend in menswear shows. Models of both genders—waifish male models and boyish female models alike—were wearing silhouettes, fabrications, and items of clothing that traditionally appear in womenswear collections. Michele’s deliberately ambiguous outfits featured massive pussycat bow blouses, shrunken jackets, and low-slung, wide-leg trousers—on willowy models with matching soft features and lengthy, undone hair. 
And just like that, this change in creative direction became symbolic of an industrywide trend—and Michele the movement’s unofficial leader. A shift toward androgyny has been building over the past two years, and with Gucci’s new experimental take, it has hit its stride. (It's worth noting that the recently slumping Gucci just reported its first sales growth in two years, a 4.6 percent increase for the second quarter of 2015—up from a 7.9 percent decrease in the first quarter.) 
Gender-bending is nothing new in fashion or pop culture. But in large-scale, high-end fashion, the theme has not been conveyed as loudly or as frequently since, well, a young Mick Jagger, David Bowie, and Marc Bolan toyed with feminized looks in the late 1960s. But today, thanks to a troupe of contemporary designers—such as Rick Owens and J.W. Anderson—this theme of gender-neutral dress has been reimagined. 
“The concept of androgyny comes up from time to time in fashion,” says Nancy Deihl, director of the costume studies MA program at New York University. “In modern fashion history, two of the most notable examples are in the 1920s and in the late 1960s into the 1970s.”
Deihl notes that both were periods of social upheaval, which reflected an empowered youth culture.
“The post-World War I generation and the 'baby boom' that created the young population of the 1960s represent times when young people had a lot of economic and cultural influence,” says Diehl. Hello, millennials.
"Androgyny is certainly not a passing trend, but one that is going through another cycle with a new generation," notes Tom Kalenderian, executive vice president and general merchandise manager for men's at Barneys New York.
Like Diehl, Kalenderian points to music subcultures as a source of unisex movements past and present, but also to a small cadre of before-their-time fashion designers. Rudi Gernreich, who after the turn of the last century began dressing women in men's suiting, was one such oracle. "Costume designers often appropriated Gernreich's vision when designing costumes for science fiction flicks, often proposing men and women in futuristic outfits that were quite similar, as an assumption of what was to come in the next millennium."
In the future, in other words, artists imagined that in the 2000s, clothes would just be clothes. Another pioneer in androgyny was Larry Legaspi, who designed space-age costumes for such musicians as Kiss and Patti Labelle in the 1970s.
"Gender play on the runway doesn't just attract a customer who wants an androgynous look, but also a consumer who likes smart clothing with a forward-thinking story," explains designer Charles Harbison, who is known for showing his womenswear collection on both female and male models. (Beyoncé is a fan of the young line, having worn one of his creations to the Adidas Originals x Kanye West show in February—another unisex and coed-casted collection.)
Department stores are now toying with devoting floor space to unisex clothing; in January, Selfridges launched the 
—a curated section of the store showcasing the retailer’s gender-spanning lines, such as 
, 
, and Gareth Pugh. The experimental floor closed its run in April. 
According to Kalenderian, clients at Barneys New York have long followed changes in the market, as they are always "looking for the next thing." He also notes that the men's sales floor at Barneys has not shifted its presentation to make way for androgyny specifically, as the store tends to group by designer and level of formality.  
Harbison, the designer, is a self-confessed "male customer [who] shops off the women's rack to find more interesting silhouettes and embellishments." He says that through his own collection, he hopes to offer more men that same experience. 
And consumer habits about gender traditions are getting broken down at younger and younger ages—
 are attempting to obliterate the barriers between clothes that are designed for young boys vs. those designed for young girls. In 10 years, a college student's idea of what is "masculine" or "feminine" clothing is likely to be drastically different. 
As always, public tastes are dictated in large part by celebrities; movie stars, musicians, and athletes have a large say in how younger generations shop and dress. For every Bowie and Jagger in the 1970s, there is a Jared Leto or Kanye West wearing a skirt on stage in 2015. But don't expect to see NBA or NFL stars getting into the androgyny arena quite yet.
“The Kanyes, Pharrells, Jared Letos, and one of my favorites, Lapo Elkanns of the world are gents I love seeing push androgynous boundaries," explains Rachel Johnson, a stylist who dresses such pro athletes as Amar'e Stoudemire and Victor Cruz.
She notes that "there is an inner confidence that guys [like Elkann] exude. You see the blurred lines in the colors, silhouettes, accessories, and hairstyles they rock. If you are this kind of guy, I'm all for it. But if you have to ask, or aren't sure, then you are likely 
 this guy.” 
The next two years will see this trend increase, according to Barneys's Kalenderian. "Clients are receptive," he says. "Ultimately it is more about beautiful clothes that are rare and special. It is more of a sidebar note that these clothes are stylistically less rigid than what we perceive to conform to a definition of masculine vs. feminine."
 

=== Title: Nine Apparel Startups to Solve the Real Style Problems of 2016 - Bloomberg ===

I would loosely estimate that at the moment there are roughly 1 trillion fashion startup ideas trying to Kickstart their way into our lives and closets. Like 
 (you can guess its purpose), or 
—which is softer than cashmere and warmer than wool—and made entirely out of ... bison.  
But just because there's an idea overload, and many of those ideas are dubious, it doesn't mean that some of the new companies out there aren't trying to solve the real problems you'll face in the new year. So, I’ve sifted through some of the noteworthy new(ish) startups and compiled a list of the ones that seem to have gotten it right, organized by the common fashion issue they're hoping to address.
One of these just might be your next sartorial savior.
 
 
Good news for those who labor to shop around the dreaded “dry-clean only” label. This Boston-based apparel company—the brainchild of a duo of disgruntled tech-industry entrepreneurs—was just greenlighted after a successful crowdfunding campaign on 
 to produce a truly stylish machine-washable blazer. Available for pre-order now for both him and her, the blazers are made of a unique blend of bonded soft and stretchy merino wool with polyester spacers that is resilient enough to withstand the tough cycle of machine washing. Right now they are available in charcoal, light gray, and navy—but the young brand hopes to expand to more ambitious colors like military green and oxblood for future collections. 
  
: 
The best part about pregnancy (other than the creation of your offspring) is that it’s temporary. Which means a woman need not invest considerably in a supplemental wardrobe she will only need for 40-ish weeks. Enter Le Tote, a subscription-based service that now helps mothers-to-be spend less on their temporary maternity wear by renting it to them (with the option to buy what they truly love) through the various stages of their pregnancies. Some of the maternity brands it stocks include: 
, 
, and Summer & Sage. 
 
 
Behold the most controversial topic in all of womenswear: Should yoga pants be worn as actual pants? 
 says no. I'm Switzerland on the subject; lifestyle permitting, I think it can be a completely acceptable means of dressing oneself—but I reserve the right of judgment when I see you in person. That said, if you’re a working professional seeking the comfort of your namaste gear, this might be the perfect pant for you. It looks like your classic tried-and-true 9-to-5 black trouser—and comes in four styles like straight-leg and leggings—but has the performance (and comfort) capabilities of something you’d wear in the mat-room only. 
 
: 
At first mention you’d think the MagBelt—essentially a strip of nylon that holds up your pants with the help of heavy-duty magnets—sounds like something you’d see being shilled on a late-night infomercial. But think about it: no holes, no flapping extra fabric or overhang—just a perfectly fitting belt that adjusts to the ups and downs of your waistline. Plus, it’s not bad-looking (in a casual-occasion-only kind of way) and it sounds kinda futuristic. Tip: Avoid the ’Merica-themed buckles and the (I can’t believe I have to tell you this) bottle-opener ones, and stick with the standard buckle only. THAT IS NOT A SUGGESTION. 
 
Marketed as a brand of “cool clothes for tech guys,” Seattle e-commerce startup Ya Joe is doing at least one thing right: pants. The line of functional (read: pockets for gadgets ’n’ crap) basics is intended to help people who don't care about fashion. It includes everything from a mock turtleneck to a woven vest, but the slimmed-up Mech cargo pant is the collection standout. It comes in a universally flattering slim-straight fit with a nearly hidden outer-thigh cargo pocket perfect for the tech guy's constant work companion: his ID badge. 
 
 
When I heard that a brand on 
 had reached 450 times its original goal of $20,000, I thought, what could possibly be so exciting? A 15-in-1 jacket that is equal parts functional outerwear and carry-on bag, in a subtle-yet-cool geek chic package, that’s what. The makers of this jacket—which comes in four models from a hooded sweatshirt to my favorite, the bomber—have thought of it all. Need a neck pillow? Check. Eye mask? Got it. A kookie drink pocket? Uh huh. You have to check it out to understand. 
 
As 
 continues to rise in popularity, the need for it to be better 
 better-looking remains a challenge. At Caeden, the one-year-old tech startup, they wouldn’t consider one without the other—which is why it just debuted the Sona, a fitness tracker/bracelet hybrid it hopes people will want to wear purely as an accessory, too. The screenless, fashion-forward smart bracelet connects to the Caeden App and tracks your day-to-day well-being like heart rate, activity, and stress levels and includes a breathing program to help you relax or stay focused, whichever is needed. 
 
 
No need to just dream of a pliable, waterproof wool sweater or jacket—because it's finally here. In what has been called the 
 in the performance apparel category since the invention of Gore-Tex in 1969, the Colorado-based outerwear brand Voormi has introduced its new Core Construction technology. In a nutshell: The company has figured out a way to insert a weatherproofing membrane directly into the fabric as it’s being knit—so that essentially the layer you see and feel against your skin is one single layer of fabric—resulting in less bulk and more comfort. Eat your heart out, Patagonia and friends. 
 
 
After I tell guys that fit is the No. 1 way to improve their wardrobe, I am usually asked the same follow-up question: How can I find a good tailor? To which I can now say: Guys, get yourself on 
—it’s an online (there’s also an app) network of tailors-on-demand (think: the Uber of tailoring) brought to you by George Zimmer, the founder of Men’s Wearhouse. You can now summon a tailor at any time, at any price for in-house or at-office alterations—so no more excusing that oversized tailoring. 
 

=== Title: How to Tie a Scarf the Best Way: Video - Bloomberg ===

Cashmere, thin, chunky, plaid, crochet, or oversized—as 
 there are in the world, there are as many opinions on how to tie them. (Well, there are a handful of ways to tie them.) And yes, there's a right way and wrong way.
There's a reason "How to Tie a Scarf" is one of the most-searched-for menswear queries on the 'net, and why the style team at Bloomberg gets asked this question all the time: Casually wrapping your scarf around your neck can lead to loose spots and frigid patches as air sneaks in, and it makes it very easy for the wind to knock it off your shoulders. Tying a scarf too tight is uncomfortable and unflattering. Toss one end over your shoulder, and you risk it looking silly as it falls every which way. If this whole tying a scarf thing is starting to sound like a the black-and-white intro to a bad infomercial, well … never again! There's an easier, better way to keep warm while keeping your winter style in order! Here are the three classics:
This method is best used with a classic cashmere scarf or thick linen scarves in the spring
 
Try this one with chunky or blanket scarfs.
 
This is with a plaid or solid medium-sized scarf, and a more formal outfit.

=== Title: Is a New York Fashion Week for Men Really a Good Idea? - Bloomberg ===

Gentlemen, you’re up.
Next week begins the first-ever fashion week in New York City singularly devoted to menswear. NYFW: Men’s runs for three days starting Monday and encompasses 56 American menswear designers. Iconic design houses such as Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger will show along with such recent hot-shots as Public School, Thom Browne, and Rag & Bone. Small but lasting brands will include David Hart, Timo Weiland, and Duckie Brown. Most of them will show at Skylight Clarkson SQ, a well-known studio in SoHo.
It’s an event that buyers and designers have long clamored for, according to the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), the parent entity, because the event conveniently syncs the menswear shows with market week, when buyers for department stores and boutiques revisit each collection to select the runway looks they’ll actually put in their stores. Market week now falls in the days directly following the shows. 
But the New York event has also exposed some pressure points in the industry about the high priority that fashion brands give to the European shows. That impulse is pitted against the strength (or lack thereof) of designer loyalties to the Anna Wintour-allied CFDA. And a larger issue is whether much emphasis should be placed on the fashion calendar and market-week schedule at all.
In short: Even though some have asked for it, there is considerable debate about whether or not the industry actually needs a men’s week in New York.
Historically, menswear fashion editors, designers, and buyers have spent June and early July 
 attending trade shows (
) and branded fashion weeks (London, in particular, is impressive). They absorb the new looks from Saint Laurent or Versace over sunny golden days punctuated by double espressos, cigarette-break gossip sessions, and late-night dinners. In America, meanwhile, the months that elapsed between February’s Fall/Winter shows and July’s market week loomed like a black hole that drained buyers of any energy they had felt during the shows.
“There was a disconnect,” says Steven Kolb, the chief executive officer of the CFDA. 
Kolb says NYFW: Mens will allow the excitement of the runway shows and presentations to translate immediately and directly to the market floor when store buyers from Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman make their purchases.
“It makes more sense to sell while you’re showing,” he said. “And the American menswear editors and buyers saw a lot of homegrown talent in their backyard. They felt it was time to put that forward.”
Indeed, the effort strongly affirms American menswear in general, which has so far played a secondary role to American womenswear. That has to do, in part, with how, until now, any menswear shows in the U.S. were interspersed randomly among the womens shows during New York Fashion Week. It also gives domestic labels that can’t afford to show in Europe their own spotlight, on their own turf, during a week when womens shows won’t eclipse their fledgling status.  
Debra Scherer, a former editor of 
and 
 and the founder of the fashion and culture ’zine 
, says the branded fashion weeks that have emerged in virtually every global cosmopolitan center indicate a broken business model altogether. The whole thing is totally out of sync with how most people buy clothing. For instance: A seaplane last weekend flew over Hamptons beaches pulling a banner advertising that Net-a-Porter.com could deliver a summer dress for a fete that night, if a lady so desired. In other words, a buying culture built on instant gratification disregards what has become an outdated fashion schedule. 
“The [store] buyers are a problem because they’re not in sync with how people shop anymore, timing-wise,” Scherer says. “That Net-a-Porter plane—that’s how people shop. The whole system is broken. It would be great if the CFDA looked at how things are broken down and how could we take advantage of that.”
What’s more, a contingent of designers and editors has expressed something rather less than jubilation about this fashion calendar addition. (And Tom Ford famously eschewed New York altogether this year, choosing instead to show his Fall 2015 womenswear collection in his home base—and primary market—of Los Angeles earlier this year.)
NYFW: Men’s directly follows the much more prestigious men’s fashion weeks (London, June 12-15; Milan, June 20-23; Paris, June 24-28), adding considerable work for designers during a time that has traditionally been reserved for tanning in Mallorca or eating lobster rolls in Amagansett. And while it makes the mens shows more accessible for editors (especially those based along the West Coast) who didn’t have the financial or personal bandwidth to travel to the collections in Europe, it creates a monthlong travel marathon for those who do.
“Another branded fashion week is the last thing we need,” Scherer says. “It’s too much, and it’s bad for the industry because it dilutes everything. That’s the grumbling I hear from everyone.” 
Adding to the mental and emotional fatigue for some is the fact that the well-established American menswear labels—Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger—that could be acting as boosters for New York’s fledgling men’s week won’t be showing their newest, best work. Most have chosen to stage presentations rather than runway shows. Lauren will present the Spring/Summer 2016 Polo collection (not the high-end Purple Label it showed in Milan) on Tuesday, and Klein will conduct a presentation of the runway looks he already introduced in Milan. Spokespeople at each house strongly denied any reluctance to present in New York, but many brands announced their participation with less than a month’s notice.
“I don’t understand why those bigger designers wouldn’t totally embrace it,” says Sydney Reising, the founder of an eponymous publicity firm that has built a reputation for boosting emerging brands such as Siki Im and Hood by Air. “For my agency, it’s exciting to have the mens stuff here. The summer months are a really big lull in terms of cash flow; it’s good for us to have additional projects to work on.”
John Varvatos, on the other hand, made a strong move of support toward NYFW: Men’s with his announcement that after seven years he wouldn’t show in Milan at all this summer, waiting instead to introduce his new line in a New York runway show next week.   
Designers Michael Bastian and David Hart say they would have shown in NYFW: Men’s regardless of  Varvatos’s or, say, Lauren’s involvement. 
“I think it’s really important that all of us American menswear designers participate,” says Bastian, who has shown full collections in Milan and at the Pitti trade show but in recent seasons has held only private appointments for key editors to view his work. “I’m an American designer, and I always felt a show somewhere other than New York might look or feel out of context." 
Reising says her own young clients—including Richard Chai who is participating—“are going to do what they’re going to do, wherever they can, whenever.” But everyone agrees that the presence of major brands helps the cause significantly.
“Having those big names does legitimize the week,” Hart says. “It makes it feel like the menswear community is really embracing this.”
The real test—for everyone—will be if the inaugural NYFW: Men’s results in increased sales. After all, even the most darling of CFDA designers must prove his worth with tangible financial results. It costs tens of thousands of dollars to produce a show—a prohibitive expense for some—and investors need tangible results.
“The best indicator of success will be if we get more accounts looking at the collection and actually buying,” Bastian says.
A spokeswoman for the CFDA declined to say exactly how much it costs for a designer to participate in NYFW: Mens but did emphasize that such sponsors as Dockers provide a healthy “platform” that enables rising designers to show. Others, such as Bastian, have partnered with corporations like GMC to produce peripheral projects that augment their reach.
“Men’s industry events like the emergence of Men’s NYFW will only help to heighten the awareness of menswear,” says Tom Kalenderian, executive vice president and general merchandise manager of menswear at Barneys. “It will certainly have a positive effect on stimulating sales.” 
Kolb says NYFW: Men’s isn’t meant to become “a spectacle” built around pop culture and celebrity-filled front rows. He said it is positioned as an industry event focusing on “clothes and market week.” 
But NYFW: Mens could certainly stand to expand. Kolb admits as much: Riccardo Tisci's decision, at Givenchy, to show his spring/summer 2016 women’s collection in New York rather than in Paris this September is something to shoot for. 
“I would love to see us grow in stature in terms of additional brands,” Kolb says. “Givenchy showing womens in New York is very validating. One day would we like to get Givenchy to show their mens here? Maybe. I would love that.”

=== Title: Reviled by Feminists, Tie-Neck Blouses Are Hip for Millennials - Bloomberg ===

Tie-neck blouses, the centerpiece of the 
 that the first generation of women managers donned and often loathed in the 1970s, are a hot item for millennials.
Retailers from Express to Tory Burch and Macy’s to Kering’s Gucci are offering the blouses in an array of colors and say they’re among this fall’s best-selling items. The style is even making appearances on many 
 this year, with Gucci featuring the blouse in its fall 2015 men’s show as both sexes crave newness in their outfitting.
“It’s something new and exciting that women in their 20s and 30s haven’t worn, and that’s why they’re embracing this so enthusiastically,” said Marisa Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Express. “They are very popular with us as well as many other retailers.”
On 
 the shirts are called a “modest office essential,” priced from $25 to $50 and offered in black, white, red, and pink, in long-sleeved and sleeveless styles. They’re pictured on models walking through urban landscapes and paired with bell-bottom flared pants, jeans, miniskirts, and even shorts.
That’s a radical change from the past. In 1977, when 
 
 became a best-seller, author John T. Malloy advised women who wanted to move up in business to wear tie-neck blouses with boxy navy-blue or gray skirt suits. Pants were deemed too sexy and inappropriate for the office.
“I remember buying the shirt and tie, which came as a set, and wearing it with a skirt suit and spike heels—and I wasn’t unhappy to give it away when I became pregnant and it no longer fit,” said Pat Cook, who started her career at Chemical Bank and is now chief executive officer of Cook & Co., a Bronxville (N.Y.)-based executive recruiter. “I was trying desperately not to stick out as a woman.”
Now, with women making up almost 50 percent of the workforce, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the bow blouse is a piece that stands out and easily transitions between the office and happy hour.
That’s the draw for Cecily Jacobson, who works in software sales at Oracle. The 22-year-old just bought a Lilly Pulitzer tie-neck blouse in four colors. Jacobson often wears them with a blazer and a skirt to work, and she prefers the unstructured fit to collared shirts that are often unflattering.
“It’s different,” said Jacobson, who’s based in Reston, Va. “It’s versatile. You can take your blazer off, and it’s perfect for going out after work.”
Modern styling is what sets the bow blouse apart from its dress-for-success heritage. Young women are wearing the blouse as a statement rather than to blend in, and adding them to outfits across multiple occasions.
“It’s a look that’s empowering but also feminine and flirty, depending on how you tie the bow,” said Danielle Merollo, director of personal shopping at Americana Manhasset, a luxury shopping center in Long Island, about 30 minutes from Manhattan. She’s been advising women to wear this season’s tie-neck blouses not only to work under suit jackets, but also paired with short or long skirts for evening wear or with jeans for casual wear. “I’m glad the bows are back,” Merollo said. “They’re a beautiful accessory.”
The ’70s trend is often not being sold to older women who remember the tie-neck blouse’s history, Express’s Jacobs said. For those who 
 want to be part of the current style, there are plenty of other options, from oversize prints to suede accents.
“I’m still going to wear it,” she said. “That’s probably bad.”

=== Title: Bordeaux Is in the Midst of a Dazzling Building Boom - Bloomberg ===

Last month, 400 people in black tie trooped through the new cellars and renovations at first-growth Château Margaux’s official unveiling. The map of the buildings, handed out on a small card, looked like a museum floor plan. 
That was the prelude to a dinner of truffled artichoke soup and guinea fowl with chanterelle mushrooms, orchestrated by Michelin-starred chef Guy Savoy.
The architecture got as many oohs and aahs as the food and wine that followed.
Margaux’s new winemaking facility, visitors center, and vinotheque, designed by prize-winning British architect Norman Foster, is just one example of Bordeaux’s ongoing glamorous building boom.
Construction cranes and gaping foundation holes now seem as much a part of the region’s landscape as rows of vines. Flush with profits from the über-expensive 2009 and 2010 vintages and a decade of rising prices, châteaux have been pumping vast amounts of euros into ambitious building projects. This is fueled partly by a new enthusiasm for wine tourism (château owners are taking a cue from Napa Valley) and partly to make room for the latest technology to push wine quality even higher, and to make an image statement while they’re at it.
Naturally, this being Bordeaux, the most famous châteaux are tapping name-brand architects and designers such as Foster, Philippe Starck, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte. And they’re shifting the region’s traditional, classical style to something bolder, more dramatic, sometimes even (gasp!) futuristic.
Here are the five latest exciting—and wildly expensive—projects, many first opened for global visitors during last month’s VinExpo week.
Owner Corinne Mentzelopoulos, who’s run the château since 1980, has been spending significant sums for the new Norman Foster buildings and renovations since the project started in 2009. No one will reveal the final cost.
The inauguration was also a bicentennial celebration, as the Foster-designed 
 (the French word for wine storeroom or cellar) is the first new building at Margaux since its iconic neo-Palladian château was built in 1815.
Forget the flamboyant futurism of Foster’s Hearst Tower in New York or his “Gherkin” skyscraper in London. His designs for Margaux are a blend of contemporary and classic.
Yes, the new red and white winemaking facility, where our tour started, consists of all glass walls, shiny stainless steel, natural light, and a curving stairway that looks like a nautilus shell. But the treelike columns holding up the tiled roof echo the colonnade of plane trees that lead up to the château, and the clay tiles, gathered from ruins on the property, match adjoining buildings.
Most of the renovations are underground, including Foster’s dimly lit, rather spooky wine library, a long corridor of black boxes with a golden screen and light at one end. The new, light-filled visitors center will offer one-hour tours to the public.
Further north, in St. Estephe, Château Montrose welcomed 1,600 people for a lavish dinner in its grand renovated 11-meter-high (36-foot) barrel cellar later in the week, at the 64th Fête de la Fleur.
During the past seven years, the estate’s buildings have been restored, rebuilt, and restructured along “green” lines. The cost? According to Chief Executive Officer Herve Berland: $65 million.
Add to that the $170 million its billionaire owners, telecom and construction tycoons Martin Bouygues (and his wife, Melissa) and brother Olivier, forked over to buy Montrose in 2006.
“I bought a tableau, a sculpture, and I have to preserve it,” Martin Bouygues told me. The 18th century exterior, refurbished, remains; inside, everything has changed. Pipes and wires are discreetly hidden inside pillars.
The team, overseen by Bouygues Rénovation Privée, included not just local architect Bernard Mazières, but also official French heritage architect Yves Grémont, specialists in marble and historic stonework, and a Parisian interior designer.
A model of sustainability, Montrose is now completely energy self-sufficient, through solar (3,000 square meters of rooftop photovoltaic panels), geothermal, and wind power, and even has excess energy to sell.
Two years ago, when I dropped by Marquis d’Alesme’s cellar in the center of the town of Margaux, it was a hole in the ground behind a ramshackle wooden barrier.
Now the project is nearly finished, revealed at another lavish party.
Billionaire Hubert Perrodo, founder and owner of oil group Perenco, bought the estate in 2006. After he died in a climbing accident later that year, his daughter, Nathalie, then 27, took over.
The outside of the new cellar, which was built from scratch from local limestone, is traditional Bordeaux—very classical. But the inside reflects Nathalie Perrodo-Samani’s desire to honor the heritage of her Chinese mother.
The interior is filled with curves and circles. Wavy brass panels that resemble a stylized golden dragon tail frame an opening where you look down at barrels. Wooden, moon-shaped doorways with sliding doors separate sections of the cellar. Cement panels on the wall are inscribed with designs representing mountains, clouds, and the sea.
Marquis d’Alesme’s renovations aim to make it the most tourist-friendly château in Bordeaux. One half-timbered building, which includes a fireplace big enough to roast 20 chickens, will host dinners. In a smaller space will be a cafe. In a gallery, you’ll be able to view the Perrodo family’s Rodin collection.
Gardeners were planting the first of six gardens that will include a labyrinthine maze for children. The official opening is May 2016.
Imagine a modest stone château encased in a glass box and set in a field backed by vines. As you walk up the path to the front door, the light bounces off the glass, making this look like some monumental futurist temple.
This little-known estate in Pauillac is this year’s most visually dramatic new architectural statement. If real estate is all location, location, location, this one can’t be topped: It’s smack between Châteaux Lafite and Château Mouton. Few people know that it was listed as a fifth-growth in the famous 1855 classification (the same as well-known Lynch-Bages). 
Jacky Lorenzetti, real estate mogul, investor, and the owner of Racing Metro 92, a Paris Rugby club, bought Pédesclaux in 2009 and enlisted Pritzker-winning architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte to renovate the château and build a winemaking cellar.
The cellar near the château echoes the same sense of glass and light. It’s a huge rectangle filled with the latest high-tech equipment. Everything works on gravity to avoid pumping the wine, and 166 vats let the winemaker ferment each vineyard plot separately.
The wine-loving Lorenzetti has splashed out about €100 million ($109 million), including for the château, additional vineyards that doubled his land, and the €20 million renovation.
“Jacky has put in place investments that will affect the next 100 years,” said general manager Emmanuel Cruse over lunch at the château. “The wines are getting better, but it will take time to achieve elegance.”
Symbolism abounds in the new cellar at this small château adjacent to first-growth Château Haut-Brion, whose vineyards are within the city limits of Bordeaux.
When Patrice Pichet, head of Bordeaux real estate developer Groupe Pichet, bought it in 2010, the price set a new record: about €3.8 million per hectare. Pichet bought up more vineyards—he now owns 33 hectares—and then had to build a new cellar to handle the increased production. He commissioned famed designer Philippe Starck and Bordeaux architect Luc Arsène-Henry to help him make the property a much visited “jewel.” 
Starck’s four-level cellar design (a €10 million project) is eye-popping, but that shouldn’t be surprising from someone who created a spaceport for Virgin Galactic. The winery looks like an upside-down ship’s hull moored in the center of a small lake and flanked by vineyard slopes, with bridges to the shore. It’s supposed to evoke Bordeaux’s history of transporting wines by ship to everywhere in the world, but I wonder how easy it will be to haul grapes over those bridges during this fall’s harvest.
Topping it all is a terrace, and the floor below is a tasting room, with views (both to be open next year). The main floor is where the grapes will be processed this fall, and the barrel cellar is buried … below the water level. Pichet says it will avoid temperature change and save energy. Maybe it’s just a sneaky way to join the craze of underwater aging.

=== Title: Top Chinese Wines Have Gone From Bad to Good. Will They Become Great? - Bloomberg ===

Ever tasted a wine made from “dragon eyes” grapes? 
Neither had I, until I attended a packed seminar and tasting of Chinese wines at trade fair 
 last week. 
I started out curious but skeptical, as most of the country’s wines I’d sampled previously were largely forgettable, especially those made from Chinese hybrid grapes with similarly poetic, unusual names like French Wild and Rose Honey. 
People outside China don’t know much about these wines because so few have been exported. Only in the past couple of years have a handful grabbed medals in international wine competitions and gained media attention. Many others were (and still are) poor, thin, lacked fruit, and often suffered from basic winemaking faults.  
To my surprise, all 17 whites, reds, and sweeties poured were impressive. Although I didn’t find a great one, I did find several very good wines well worth trying. (See tasting notes below.) 
Keep in mind that the point of the tasting, a first at VinExpo, was to improve the image of Chinese wine and convince the international wine trade elite that the country isn’t only content to knock back bling bottles of expensive French Bordeaux and Burgundy. 
The tasting was also a collaboration between the European Committee of Wine Companies (CEEV) and the China Alcoholic Drinks Association, part of last year’s settlement of a European Union and China 
 on wine. China dropped its investigation into the alleged dumping of European wine imports in China in exchange for technical and marketing advice. 
The whole event was essentially a crash course in how seriously the Chinese are aiming for their own spot on the world’s wine map.  
Here’s a stunning fact passed on by moderator Demei Li, associate professor of oenology at Beijing Agricultural College: China now has more acres of vineyards than France. It's the world’s fifth-largest wine-consuming country and the eighth-largest wine producer, pumping out 130 million 9-liter cases annually, according to the latest VinExpo/IWSR statistics. Some of France’s best producers, like Château Lafite-Rothschild, have invested there. 
Once that’s sunk in, consider China’s winery-building boom. Giant Chinese companies have invested tens of millions in enormous French-style wine chateaux in every region, even up in Liaoning near the North Korean border.
Yet the history of modern grape wine in China started only about a century ago in Shandong province near Beijing where Zhang Bishi founded the Changyu winery in 1892. In recent years, adventurous wineries have rapidly moved outward to explore the country’s vast possibilities for great terroir. Wines I tasted came from Ningxia, 550 miles west of Beijing in central China; Liaoning; and Xinjiang, the desert region in the far northwest that’s home to the Uyghurs. 
So far, Ningxia is the region that’s drawn the most attention for quality wine potential
so it was no surprise that almost half the wines in the tasting came from this area that might turn out to be China’s Napa Valley. Last year it began a program of enlisting winemakers from around the world to advise local wineries, even going so far as to name chateaux after them. 
With lots of sun, 1,100 meters of altitude, hot dry summers, and the Yellow River for irrigation, Ningxia has ideal grape-growing conditions, similar to New World locations in Argentina and Chile—except that it also has harsh, freezing winters so cold that the vines have to be buried in the earth to survive until spring. Other producers are betting on Yunnan province, with new vineyards at altitudes of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. 
 in a new winery there, close to the Tibet border. 
China is basically red wine country. According to VinExpo statistics, more than 91 percent of the wines the Chinese drink are red, but in the tasting I found several whites showed serious potential. The most popular grape is cabernet sauvignon, but wines made from aglianico and syrah are coming soon. 
The first wine we tasted, a white made from local table grape longyan (which means "dragon eyes"), reminded me a little bit of gewürztraminer. A grape name new to me was cabernet gernischt, a widely planted red in China. It’s now thought to be the same as carménère, a grape popular in Chile, but in China the wines sometimes have an unattractive green, peppery taste. 
Among the wines in the tasting that most impressed me were several from Changyu, China’s oldest and largest commercial winery, which planted vineyards with imported vine cuttings from France.
The company now has some 35,000 hectares of vineyards—more than one-quarter the area of all Bordeaux’s vineyards—located in several of the country’s major wine-growing regions such as Ningxia, Liaoning, Penglai peninsula, and Yinjiang. Two years ago, the company unveiled a new 70 million-euro winery in Ningxia province. 
After the tasting, I stopped by the huge, square Changyu stand, the company’s debut at VinExpo. A wall of photographs showing world leaders sampling Changyu wines at state banquets trumpeted a loud message: If Francois Hollande, President Obama, Angela Merkel, David Cameron, Joe Biden, and Vladimir Putin can drink these wines, what’s holding you back? 
Made from vines nearly 100 years old in Hebei close to Beijing, this easy white is light, fresh, and tangy, with peachy aromas.
This rich, opulent, almost buttery white comes from the Yinchuan area of Ningxia where lots of chardonnay is planted. 
Dark and elegant, with some herbal, tobacco-y flavors, this red from Xinjiang is bottled at the end of December for the Chinese New Year. 
Round, bright, spicy, with definite hints of wood aging, this Ningxia red has won several awards in the U.K. and France. 
Made in Xinjiang province, this appetizing, satisfying dark red tastes of herbs and cassis. 
Rich, sweet, and opulent, this ice wine made from frozen grapes grown in Liaoning rivals good Canadian ice wines.

=== Title: London Collections Mens Highlights: Sparking with Bowie Stardust - Bloomberg ===

On the eve of the last day of 
, I was up well past midnight “watching” the Golden Globes in my hotel room in Covent Garden. I say watching, but of course the show isn’t actually aired across the pond, so I was actually reading my way through the four-hour-plus ceremony on Twitter, learning who wore and won what. And then the news came through: Legendary Singer 
.
The news spurred a moment of mourning and reflection. It’s one of those moments I’ll be able to call up with the same precision thirty years from now.
The morning after at the fashion shows, the mood was most certainly more somber than the previous day. Bowie’s music played on repeat during the opening and closing minutes of the week's headlining Burberry show; the models paid him a silent tribute by wearing glitter-swept cheekbones. And fittingly, like so many shows before it earlier in the week, the looks had flashes of Bowie’s once-daring avant-garde ambiguity. His presence was there. It’s always there.
It would be nearly impossible to compile a "best of" list in regards to Bowie and his signature, now iconic, ever-changing fashions and personas, so I won't try. But I think it's worth highlighting the collections and designs of the current crop of London runways (some by designers you might be least familiar with—but should be) that still carry hints of his influence and spirit. After all, how can you ever move beyond an extraordinary fashion icon, when his lasting influence was a spellbinding ability to grow and change?
This young Brit’s designs focus on simple, smartly-tailored pieces in luxurious fabrications like uncut velvet. His collections either embody a military subtext or offer a fresh, modern spin on the genderless trend. 
The brand and the man formed in 2010 with the idea of utilizing repurposed military garments to create excellent outerwear inspired by travel for the masculine urban explorer. 
Joseph, a successful boutique-turned-fashion-label, only launched its menswear extension five years ago, but is soaring thanks to its understated-yet-luxurious aesthetic headed by designer Mark Thomas (formerly of Givenchy and Neil Barrett).
This collection is pure London, complete with a Savile Row ancestry that dates back to the 1950s. Now, under the new design direction of Darren Barrowcliff, the collection aims to be a more innovative option for the more forward-thinking traditionalists. 
There's always something a little glam rock-star about creative director Jeremy Scott's Moschino.
He has a tongue-in-check approach to fashion that stands out in the industry—which at the moment is leaning towards subtlety. Scott's embrace of more-is-more can actually be refreshing. 
This longtime UK mainstay is coveted by gents looking for a dose of boyish Britishness (think: crisp, collarless shirts and perfectly-pleated trousers) with an emphasis on supreme-fit and subtle-detailing. 
There's never anything boring or expected about Eary's designs. She favors boldness, both in color and theme, and has attracted notable supporters such as Kate Moss and Kanye West (she actually aided him in the debut of his own fashion line). 

=== Title: LVMH's Hublot May Be Next Brand for Smart Functions, Biver Says - Bloomberg ===

Hublot will probably be the next LVMH watch brand to add smart functions, following TAG Heuer’s footsteps in combining Swiss craftsmanship and connected technology, according to 
’s watch chief.
Hublot may add intelligent functions to watches in 2017 or 2018, and Zenith could also consider doing so sometime, Jean-Claude Biver said in an interview at the Baselworld watch fair. Some of the functions could be sports-related, similar to its sister brand TAG Heuer, he added.
TAG Heuer is one of the few high-end luxury competitors that has responded to the Apple Watch with its own $1,500 smartwatch. The company started selling it last year, and has had to boost production to keep up with demand. Last year’s arrival of the Apple Watch has weighed on sales of lower-priced timepieces. Swiss watch exports posted their first annual decline in six years in 2015.

=== Title: Meet Four Artisans Making Custom Knives, Bikes, and Jewelry - Bloomberg ===

“Luke and I had been making bespoke knives out of recycled materials for our friends long before we knew anything about business. Once we built a website, chefs in Atlanta began commissioning us for knives, and a few home and design blogs picked us up. The process begins with finding the perfect metal, shaping it, then heat-treating it in a 1,500F oven to harden. From there, blades undergo weeks of testing, grinding, finishing, and sharpening. Foraging for parts is half the fun: We source metals from Volkswagen junkyards and machine shops. These are products we want our customers to have for life—we offer an unconditional lifetime warranty and free service. Even if you run over the knife with your car, we’ll fix it for you free of charge.” 
“I went to Morocco in 2008 and fell in love with all the Bedouin jewelry there. The crescent moon-shaped earrings and gold tassel necklaces inspired me to try my hand at jewelry. I came out with my first collection in 2010—50 pieces of turquoise earrings, necklaces, and rings. To this day, the 14-karat triangle studs from my debut collection are bestsellers. My philosophy is that great design should merge the precious with the practical: I’ll set a rare Australian opal on a curved gold band, for example, or surround an oblong-shaped piece of aquamarine with pinprick-size red diamonds. White solitaires are great, but there’s something unconventionally graceful about an engagement ring with a pear-cut Montana sapphire or a cognac-colored tourmaline. I try to keep that in mind with my everyday collections, which feature hexagon-shaped pearl pendants and emerald-and-black-diamond cluster rings. My trick is not to overdesign anything. I’d rather surprise customers with shapes, colors, and stones that they’d never think to combine.” 
“I got my first mountain bike at 13, and I fell in love with the sport. In 2002, I launched Geekhouse Bikes, a line of bespoke, versatile cycles. Every component, from the leather on the seat to the width of the tires, is built for the individual rider. Our eight-month design process starts with selecting one of seven base styles: The Porteur Brentwood is a no-frills commuter bike; the Rando is for long-haul cross-country bikers. After consulting with clients about lifestyle and injuries, then their neck width and foot size, we handcraft bikes from American steel and finish them in one of 6,500 baked-on powder coats. We work with a local painter who adds designs like art deco patterns or World War I battleships. When you’re spending thousands of dollars on a bike, it should be exactly what you want, even if that means three separate water-bottle holders.”

=== Title: Cadillac to Sponsor First-Ever New York Fashion Week for Men - Bloomberg ===

While the New York womens' collections have 
 to replace longtime title sponsor Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac has signed on to become the first-ever automotive backer of New York Fashion Week: Men’s.
The agreement, signed to last two seasons, includes producing a variety of related events and providing Cadillac vehicles as shuttles for attendees. Shinola, Amazon Fashion, and Dreamworks have also been confirmed as sponsors for the fashion week focusing on menswear. 
"I am very much interested in taking Cadillac into the world of fashion," Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen tells us. "The whole idea of beginning to strengthen Cadillac's position as a lifestyle brand is very much central to our mission. This is a good start. ... It should be interpreted as a clear statement of intent that we will walk with a heavy footstep in the fashion world."
This is a telling move from a 113-year-old brand that was reportedly considering the title sponsorship of what was formerly Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, which showcases womenswear. Mercedes-Benz ended its title role there earlier this year; the twice-annual event has suffered a deficit of energy since moving from Bryant Park to Lincoln Center in 2010. Many fresh, new fashion brands started showing their wares at off-site locations—often involved with MADE Fashion week.
Earlier this year, Cadillac hosted 
 during New York Fashion Week, when it allowed Public School to show its Autumn/Winter 2015 menswear and womenswear collection in the automaker’s new offices, situated between Tribeca and the West Village.
"We evaluated New York Fashion Week, and we continue to think it’s a worthy property," De Nysschen says. "But we weren’t ready to figure out how to fully integrate that into our overall marketing strategy."
Cadillac’s decision to sponsor men’s fashion week (which is backed by the Council of Fashion Designers of America), rather than New York Fashion Week, speaks to its desire to return to the cutting edge of culture. In recent years, the automaker has struggled to revitalize its fuddy-duddy image; last year the average buyer of a Cadillac was 59.5 years old, according to the global information company IHS Automotive—much older than the thirties to early forties age range most desirable to luxury brands.
The men's week sponsorship is totally new—a first. It's an essential first at that, industry insiders say.
"Cadillac needs that cool, fashionable, 'gets it' association to appeal to all consumers, especially Gen Xers and Millennials, who still have a perception of an older brand," Milton Pedraza, chief executive officer of the New York City-based Luxury Institute, said via e-mail from Stockholm.  
In addition to the role during men’s fashion week, Cadillac will continue as a presenting sponsor of New York Men’s Day, a special day formerly set aside during the womenswear-heavy New York Fashion Week to highlight emerging menswear designers. This year, that day will move to July in order to align with NYFW: Men. This will be the second season that Cadillac participates.
New York Fashion Week: Men's runs July 13-16 at Skylight Clarkson Square in downtown Manhattan. A spokesman for Cadillac declined to disclose the amount of the new sponsorship. 

=== Title: How to Wear Tights: Buying Guide - Bloomberg ===

A little more than a week ago, there was some hoopla on the Internet about 
 on the social politics of wearing black tights (yes, apparently that's 
) in the 
. The author, the newspaper's veteran fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley, suggested that a woman's choice to wear black tights "reveals a lot about your status, age, class and self-image." 
Her argument, in a nutshell, was that only the rich and/or beautiful women can and should dare to bare-leg it once the temperatures drop. The rest of us must use stretchy, ultra-concealing fabric as a safety blanket to hide our bottom halves. For God's sake, don't let anyone see that vitamin D-deprived pale skin or those imperfect kneecaps. 
, bloggers, and 
 fired back, particularly against Cartner-Morley's point that fashion is a matter of age, body-type, and position rather than taste. 
Here is my stance on the surprisingly controversial debate: I actually love tights. I’ve lived in them every fall and winter and sometimes spring since childhood. I'm from Florida, and I'm a chilly-weather wuss, I admit it. But frankly it never occurred to me that wearing black tights would make people think I was (gasp) not fancy. 
The simple leg coverings can actually be useful in ways other than keeping you warm. They can change the way an outfit looks on you, which means if you're young and don't have a ton of money for clothes, you can use them to multiply your wardrobe. I discovered this when I first moved to New York at 23 and owned only one pinstriped suit that was appropriate for my job as an editorial assistant. With tights, I could turn spaghetti-strap dresses and miniskirts into demure-enough workwear.  
I may be a professional fashionista now, but I still like the cute-meets-cozy look and feel of a pair of old-fashioned opaque hosiery. And I have some tips for you on how you should be using them yourself, starting with the basics.
Call us unfancy if you like, British fashion critics. I prefer the term "sensibly dressed." 
 
Black stockings are truly a glorious invention. Far from boring or basic, this simple accessory actually allows us ladies to 
 extend the shelf life of our favorite warm-weather wardrobe pieces, such as shorter skirts and floral-print dresses. Still, not all black tights are created equal—here are some of the best on the market, organized by fit, details, and material. 
 Knit tights, such as this cable-knit pair by 
, are a great subtle shake-up to the predominantly solid, spandex-blend opaque ones. They will add texture and interest to your gams without adding unwanted bulk. 
If you prefer a less constricting fit, try something with a wider, invisible waistband, such as 
 tights 
—the company is known for its dig-free technology (read: no muffin top). Remember, when choosing your size, it's OK to go up or down, but stay in your height range or you'll risk sagging in the knee and crotch areas. 
 While a splurge, 
 tights 
are great if you like supersoft (and ultra-opaque) hosiery that really keeps its shape after multiple wears. 
 For added warmth, stock up on hard-to-find, fleece-lined tights–such as this pair by 
—which are so thick they could actually double as leggings. They are an especially great alternative if Lycra makes your legs itchy. 
 
 is known for its long-lasting and affordable legwear, such as its 
 tights 
which have a slight sheen and a snug fit (despite lacking a control top) and are known to be pretty snag-resistant. (I still suggest keeping an extra pair in your office desk just in case.) 
 
Now take your carefully curated selection of black basics, add some unexpected picks, and apply these easy, smart styling tricks to amp up (and warm up) your stems from now until April. 
Don't retire your beloved sleeveless dress for the season just yet. Just pop on a wooly, cropped blazer (or perhaps a belted, chunky cardigan) and finish with your favorite trusty nylons and suede boots for a seasonally appropriate outfit. Or make dressy dresses more casual by adding some hose and substitute a great pair of ankle booties instead of your special-occasion six-inch stilettos. 
Beyond classic-hued opaques, a subtle print on tights—like the vertical stripes on this pair by 
—can instantly elevate an outfit without the busyness of an elaborate pattern. Bonus: Tights that look like this also have a lengthening effect. 
Reinvent a favorite pair of open-toe pumps or booties (like the pair above by 
) by styling them around your favorite hosiery.
Just be conscious of doubling up on out-of-season elements. Avoid summery florals and linen-like fabrics if your toes are peeking out. 
 Contrast your black hose (or other darks, such as hunter green and navy) with pops of bold, or flashy, colors. Bright pieces—such as red shoes or a safety orange knit—will appear even brighter when you provide stark contrast down below. 
Black tights worn with black shoes will create one flatteringly slim line. But so will navy with navy, and burgundy with burgundy, and so on—so experiment with some other monochromatic pairings. 
 

=== Title: Every Single Expensive Thing in James Bond’s Spectre, Explained - Bloomberg ===

You may have heard that in the new James Bond movie 
, Daniel Craig’s Bond drives an 
 one of only 10 made and worth $4.6 million on the street.
He’s chased by a villain in a 
 supercar worth more than 
 and which Jaguar says it will never send to actual production. 
But that’s just the start of the high-priced life 007 inhabits in this 24th installment of the Bond franchise. (As a side note, with a budget of $300 million, 
 equals 
 as the 
.)
The luxury starts from the moment we see his 
 and 
watches at a Day of the Dead festival in Mexico, continues through his sparse (but enviably located)London flat and his proclivity for high-end vodka spirits to the way he maneuvers a private plane across Austria. Even his cuff links and sunglasses demand careful attention.
“Don’t forget, Bond is a detail man,” Costume designer Jany Temime said in a thick French accent the morning after the film’s Mexico City North American premiere. “He comes from the Navy.”
And then there’s Léa Seydoux’s Madeleine Swann, dressed in custom ball gowns, diamond earrings, and delicate silk crème frocks frolicking through boutique hotels and African locomotive trains near Tangiers.  
It’s plenty to tally, but here are the best of the big-ticket luxury items from director Sam Mendes’s second Bond film. 
Throughout the movie Bond wears Tom Ford bespoke clothing, including an ivory 
 (
 for the off-the-rack version) and tuxedo shirt, three different dress shirts, including one with turnback cuffs, two formal coats (one each for Rome and London), four neckties, a bow tie, and a pocket square. 
In London near Whitehall, Bond sports a gray pin-stripe suit, white shirt, gray necktie, and navy coat, all by Tom Ford. He also wears a 
, 
 that he wore in the movie 
, in several scenes in the film. It’s a fine, small manufacturer of the world’s best cashmere. 
“I tried to find a traditional look for Bond, a classic look,” Temime said. “Bond is a classic man. He is confident and sure of himself, and he has exactly the right clothes for the situation. He is the epitome of an English gentleman.” 
Bond also wore the
 in the Mexico opening sequence and other scenes and a
 in Rome. In a London meeting with M, Bond wears a 
.  
“I had the long coat made by Tom Ford,” Temime said. “He was supposed to be one of the Italian gangsters in that scene, not too much, but slightly more arrogant, slightly more obvious than an English gentleman would wear.”
In the Alps, Bond wears a 
, and special 
 complete with black leather side shields. He also wore trousers based on vintage military models. Temime had them specially made.
“Those were based off French army ski trousers, 1960s ski trousers,” she said. “I took them to Tom Ford, and he made them for us. It was very old-fashioned the way he did it, with the same look.” 
Along with the Vuarnet shades, Bond wore the 
 in 
, especially in the scenes shot in Rome. He also wore the 
 model in Morocco. Madeleine wore a pair from Persol. 
Bond wears 
in several cold-weather scenes and a pantheon of handsome shoes by the British firm Crockett & Jones. Standouts include 
 and 
.
As for watches, Bond is an Omega man. He wears two in this film, 
 and 
He matches those at one point with small round black and 
, which Christie’s valued at nearly 
.
It’s also worth noting that Sony is a tech partner on this film, so the cameras and electronics are duly branded as such. A Sony 'Made for Bond' ad campaign shows Naomie Harris as Moneypenny finding Bond's phone, which in the commercial is a 
which costs more than
.
Bond first meets Madeleine at her desk in the Hoffler Klinik, a fictional health getaway on Gaislachkogl Mountain.
Like 
villain Oberhauser’s meteor-housing 
, the Klinik was a composite of a real location, a studio, and CGI effects. Filmmakers had to manufacture 400 tons of snow to cover the hillside. 
“We went to the Alps in Switzerland and Austria and Italy,” Production Designer Dennis Gassner said on the phone in Mexico City. “Luckily, I found [the ski resort] Sölden in Austria and a restaurant, the ICE-Q, at the top of this ski lift, which became the foundation for what we needed. The Klinik is a little bit of an ice jewel in the middle of the movie.” The rest of the interior scenes were shot at a studio in England; building a state-of-the-art medical clinic in the Austrian Alps would probably have cost more than $100 million.
In Rome, the filmmakers shot for four days at the 
 which doubled for where Bond sees the widow, Lucia Sciarra (played by Monica Bellucci). As for 
, producer Barbara Broccoli called it one of the most difficult sets to get right, because everyone has an idea in their minds about the kind of place where Bond would live. Gassner declined to divulge where it was located in London, though any proper London apartment of that size would run in the 
.
“You had to go deeper than underground,” he said, speaking figuratively about Bond's deeply secluded apartment. “The decision to go into his space was very personal, so it had to be even more private than that.”
As for its sparseness (a big bottle of Macallan 18-year is the main furnishing), Gassner said that’s the most realistic thing about it.
“Bond is a man on the run all the time,” he said. “He lives a life that is extremely active and probably doesn’t spend a lot of time there. To me, it was the right thing to do.”
M, on the other hand, has the archetypical "red door" room look for his office—the traditional Whitehall environment that housed Bernard Lee’s M across the years. Q’s lab features lots of mechanical devices and high-tech devices, all bespoke from his own mad-lab mind, of course.
Léa Seydoux’s Swann had to look sexy for her role, as you might expect. But Temime also wanted to convey that this was a woman on the move.
“She was traveling,” she said. “That light green dress that she wore in the train was specially made for her. I wanted a dress that she could roll in and could be glamorous and where she could breathe.”
In fact, most of the clothing Swann wore was specially made, from the crème dress she wore in Morocco to her suits in Austria. But for Temime, that ghostly sea foam bespoke dress was the standout. 
“I loved the green dress best, and the tuxedo,” she said. “She had that dress. He had that white tuxedo. They are in Morocco, in a train, which is an incredible look. Together they are like a dream couple.”
Elsewhere, Seydoux wore 
) and used handsome 
 while in Morocco. 
This is an area that proved tricky to identify, since most of the liquor bottles in 
 had their labels strategically facing 
from the camera. But there are several sponsorship collaborations that continued here, namely that 
 
 and 
 for that famous “shaken, not stirred” martini. There’s also a 
 on the Moroccan trainride (he drank it also with Vesper in 
), and, thankfully, that
 on Bond's table at his London apartment. 
There are many guns used in this film, but standouts include a 
) and 
. Mr. Hinx used a double-barrel 
 
As for noncar toys in 
 three different helicopters were involved, including a 
 in Morocco, a twin-engine 
 in London, and a 
 
 in Mexico City. That one was flown by the Red Bull aerobatic helicopter stunt pilot Chuck Aaron and was modified so he could do barrel rolls and dives. 
Then there’s the 
 through Morocco, which filmmakers described as especially punishing. They filmed in Tangier and Erfoud and Oujda in the northeast part of the country, where temperatures averaged of 113 degrees Fahrenheit.
In fact, the element of hot-to-cold-to-hot again drove much of the production and location decisions for this movie, Glassner said. Back in Austria, a 
 a 1960s British light utility aircraft, was used for a major car/plane chase scene. In all, eight aircraft were used on a variety of stunts. 
Now for the icons: the cars. 
 is the first Bond film for which Aston Martin built a car specifically. (Others, such as the DB5 that made its debut in 1964’s 
, the DBS from 1969’s 
, and the V8 Volante from 1987’s 
, were all cars sold to the public.) The 
 is a prototype based on a modified Vantage, with a longer wheelbase and a 4.7-litre V8 engine. It has an estimated top speed of 190 mph and can get from zero to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds, according to Aston (in the film that number is closer to 3 seconds). 
Its nose is shark-inspired, to hint at the car’s stealthy character, producers said, and all its body panels are carbon fiber with a full clamshell hood and a heat-mapped perforation pattern, which negated the need for vents.
“I wanted a car that had clean, clear lines,” director Mendes said in production notes. In the film, Q says it cost £3 million, or about $4.6 million. That’s including, presumably, the upgrades the 
 Q added, like rear-mounted flame-throwers, bullet-proofing, and an immediate-ejector seat.
The villain Mr. Hinx’s Jaguar was no slouch, either. Indeed, the C-X75 has a combined power output of 850 hp on a Formula 1-inspired, 1.6-litre turbocharged and supercharged four-cylinder power plant. It has a seven-speed transmission, and the car can sprint from zero to 100 mph in fewer than six seconds.
According to production notes, the first C-X75 prototype exceeded 200 mph in testing. 
“The Jag was so powerful that we had to tone down the engine so the throttle response wasn’t so aggressive,” said 
 stunt coordinator Gary Powell. All told, seven Jaguars were used to film the Rome chase scene. 
Elsewhere in the film, Bond gets picked up in a 
 and drives 
 and up; the one from 
 was sold by RM Auctions for $4.6 million in 2010). The Austria car chase required 11 
 
 and seven 
, all of which were heavily modified. The villain Oberhauser has a couple of 
 at his disposal; and if you care, Monica Bellucci’s grieving widow Lucia drives around in a 
among other similarly dark sedans in the film.
There’s also a scene at Blenheim Palace that doubles as the location of the Spectre group meeting in Rome. The parking lot there is a fantasyland of rare vehicles that set designers used to “paint a picture of the mafia types that would be attending the meeting,” they said, including a 
, a full 
 
, 
, and a handful of other supercars, including 
 and 
 
Filming the car chases—in Rome, in the woods—complicated matters considerably. In Rome, filmmakers shut down key portions of the city, including a section alongside the Tiber looking toward St. Peter’s Square and the Coliseum. That chase alone used eight Aston Martins and seven Jaguars driven at 100 mph by stunt pros. In the mountains, those Land Rovers were towed more than 3,000 meters up the mountain by snowmobiles, since there was no road access, and given tires with 1,500 hand-applied studs. 
All told, the production crew blew up 
 worth of cars. Ouch.
If you ask Glassner, though, he’ll say it was all worth it. 
“Our influence on this movie was 
we had to top that,” he said. “It’s also about honoring a franchise. Every day I would think, ‘What would the audience want to get out of this?’ I do it for you guys.”

=== Title: New York Fashion Week SS16 Recap: 7 Trends to Get in Your Closet - Bloomberg ===

Twice a year, the streets of Manhattan light up with a swirl of style as the runways of 
 reveal the trends to come in spring/summer 2016.
Wait, what? You missed it?
Even if you didn’t attend a single show (or even know that #NYFW was happening), you can still play it off over drinks with your more style-inclined friends. For starters: NYFW is no longer held at Lincoln Center. And it’s no longer sponsored by Mercedes-Benz. The new official name is New York Fashion Week: The Shows, as WME/IMG aim to make it into a 
 all its own.
It was also a season of milestones. While both Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy and Alexander Wang marked their 10-year anniversaries, Betsey Johnson celebrated her 50th—no, not a typo. Tisci’s Givenchy show was a particular standout, with Kim Kardashian West, Julia Roberts, and an additional 1,000-plus guests in attendance. (Kim’s hubby Kanye also had another insane show, which looked 
, so let’s not even go there.) On the party circuit, aside from the above and 
 at the old Tunnel space, the only one that really mattered was Carine Roitfeld’s “Bazaar Icons,” held at the Plaza Hotel. Guests including Mariah Carey and Rita Ora toasted while Katy Perry performed some of her biggest hits.
And of course, there were clothes. Get familiar with the following seven trends, because you’re going to see them a whole lot come spring—and may want to debate their merits after that second cocktail now.
Don’t give away your florals just yet. Fashion may be fickle, but this trend, which we saw everywhere this summer—even on 
—seems to be sticking around for at least another season.
Want to amp up the versatility of your favorite black dress? The runways (and 
) showed us a way, and it’s simple: Throw some pants under it. Or keep it casual up top with a business pant on the bottom.
Baja what? Think Woodstock by way of Southern California, and you’re almost there. Forget about everything you thought about tie-dyed shirts, oversize racer tanks, and patchwork bucket hats, because they’re all a thing—for a person with a certain type of attitude at least.
White will always be a trend come summer, so this NYFW was just a reminder. From flowy mesh dresses to more-tailored tops, keep an eye out for a favorite cut—then find it in white.
 
You know how guys can get away with wearing really dapper suits with a 
? This year we saw the female version. 
.
 
If the shows this season were any indication, the tombstone for skinny jeans will read 2004–2016 next spring. It’s a wide-leg world, so get ready to pump up the volume with something loose, slouchy, and at the same time stylish, as designers sew plenty of breathing room into ladies’ trousers.
 
The belly shirt is back. Prepare to get even cozier with your Pilates instructor.

The four-century old Swiss watch industry is now running behind smartwatches in terms of shipments now that Apple Inc. is in the game, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics. But measured by value, the newfangled gadgets have further to go before they can dethrone the Swiss industry, which is convening at the Baselworld watch fair to unveil its latest creations. The smartwatch market was worth $2 billion in the fourth quarter at wholesale prices, about a third the size of the $5.7 billion Swiss-made sector.

=== Title: How Not to Sweat in Summer, Even When You’re Dressed Up - Bloomberg ===

By now you are likely more than well aware that with the best aspect of summer (sunshine) also comes the most unfortunate one: the heat. And with heat comes the ever-present threat of perspiration. 
The easiest way to beat the heat would be to find the nearest pool, throw on some swim trunks, and don't ever, ever leave until the Tuesday after Labor Day. But that's not a realistic solution for most of us who are not lifeguards. To help the rest of you out, I turned to associate market editor Moti Ankari. He has great personal fashion and more than 100,000 followers on his Instagram 
, so you can trust him. Using the occasion of the inaugural 
 as a backdrop, he dressed up to give you some styling lessons in looking cool, while staying cool, too. 
If you follow these tips and rules,  you too might become an Instagram street-style star. Or at least you'll look like one.  
Especially in regard to suiting. Back in spring, we 
 various khaki suits for you to try out—and for good reason. It's the most versatile of humidity-busting ensembles for men, and it's appropriate everywhere, from the workplace to whatever it is you're doing after hours. Just remember: The dressiness level depends on the shade and weight of the cotton. In general, the lighter in color it is, the more dress-up possibilities, and the darker (and thicker), the more casual.
 Here, Moti looks equal parts relaxed and polished, thanks to the cotton pocket square. The outfit gives a sense of, "Look, I know I could have worn a tie here, but I am choosing not to." Also, notice that in all the looks, Moti is sockless—or at least looks as if he is—he actually has on no-show shoe liners so he can bare his ankles freely and control unwanted sweating.  (Here is 
.)
There's a falsehood in men's style that arms are like legs—meaning, if you're showing them, you're definitely dressed 
. And while I remain firm that you should probably steer clear of leg baring in any context other than a Saturday morning coffee run (or just a run), I do think you can show a little arm and look dressed up. Start by rolling your sleeves up to just below the elbow, get comfortable, and go from there. 
 This look can easily replace a classic shirt, tie, and trouser combination for three reasons. 1) The shirt is perfectly fitted. 2) The invisible buttons lend a clean, toned-down look. (When you try this at home, you don't need to use a bold graphic print like Moti wears here. Start with a plain color or pattern.) 3) Not wearing a tie but buttoning your collar button—we call this "air tie"—makes you look more reserved and put-together. It's not just for nerds any more. A little roll of the sleeve is a nice added touch; just don't make it too tight or high.
Look, a fitted suit is inherently cleaner and more flattering, but sometimes the occasion (a day with temperatures above 85) calls for a little more room around you for air to circulate. If you do decide to pick up a new, roomier suit option—start with the material. Stay away from man-made fibers, such as polyester, and make sure your wares are cotton only. Look for twill, poplin, madras, or seersucker. And always choose an unlined suit, or half-lined.  
 The crew-neck shirt here on Moti is actually a tank top. Smart. But the key to pulling 
 off is to commit to not taking your blazer off. Like, ever. The other thing is to look for a blazer with soft, natural shoulders and a higher armhole—like this option by Todd Snyder on Moti—for better, unrestricted movement. 
Every man should own a great, gray suit—but the thing about a gray suit, especially the lighter ones, is it can actually show off sweat. Nonetheless, if your gray suit is your best suit, and not wearing it for three months out of the year is not an option, then you have to style around it to pull it off.
 you could just wear a darker suit. Despite the conventional belief that you shouldn't wear dark colors when the temperature rises, the darker colors—blue, charcoal—are actually better at disguising any unwanted perspiration.
 Black and gray are relatively work-or play-appropriate, and this look works with or without the blazer (giving two quite different feels, too). And the black T-shirt, which is the actual garment touching the skin, will disguise any unwanted tinges of sweat, so Moti can wear his favored icy-gray suit comfortably and confidently. 
Sure, you could wear it under a blue oxford under your blue suit in the hopes it will keep you cooler and wick moisture away from you body—or you could just skip that extra layer all together and go right for the fashion editor-endorsed look of T-shirt under a blazer.  
Few things in a man's wardrobe are more classic than a white, v-neck T-shirt. If you're wearing it under a suit, like this custom linen one on Moti, make sure the T-shirt is either untucked and does not go past your belt-line or is tucked without being too billowy. Then try unbuttoning the jacket cuff (and maybe nonchalantly push it up like a shirt sleeve) to allow a little extra airflow into the sleeves. 
There was a time (last season) when I would have never thought a polo would be appropriate under a blazer. But I've realized that is because I have seen it done so wrong so often. In other words, it's not just about a polo, but the
 polo, if you are wearing it to replace a dressier shirt option. Try it, though; the polo is actually quite adaptable and can make a cool statement (for work, even) under your favorite unlined sport jacket. (More importantly, it's less fabric on your arms to heat you up.)
Skip anything too busy or printed if you're pairing it under a blazer and opt for a classic solid, such as this crisp, white Polo Ralph Lauren one on Moti. Also, make sure it's fitted throughout the trunk and arms, and like the T-shirt above, hits right at or below your belt-line if wearing it untucked (my suggestion). And skip the neckerchief. Even Moti can't persuade me to believe in that runway-inspired trend.
 
 

=== Title: London Collections Mens Highlights: Sparking with Bowie Stardust - Bloomberg ===

On the eve of the last day of 
, I was up well past midnight “watching” the Golden Globes in my hotel room in Covent Garden. I say watching, but of course the show isn’t actually aired across the pond, so I was actually reading my way through the four-hour-plus ceremony on Twitter, learning who wore and won what. And then the news came through: Legendary Singer 
.
The news spurred a moment of mourning and reflection. It’s one of those moments I’ll be able to call up with the same precision thirty years from now.
The morning after at the fashion shows, the mood was most certainly more somber than the previous day. Bowie’s music played on repeat during the opening and closing minutes of the week's headlining Burberry show; the models paid him a silent tribute by wearing glitter-swept cheekbones. And fittingly, like so many shows before it earlier in the week, the looks had flashes of Bowie’s once-daring avant-garde ambiguity. His presence was there. It’s always there.
It would be nearly impossible to compile a "best of" list in regards to Bowie and his signature, now iconic, ever-changing fashions and personas, so I won't try. But I think it's worth highlighting the collections and designs of the current crop of London runways (some by designers you might be least familiar with—but should be) that still carry hints of his influence and spirit. After all, how can you ever move beyond an extraordinary fashion icon, when his lasting influence was a spellbinding ability to grow and change?
This young Brit’s designs focus on simple, smartly-tailored pieces in luxurious fabrications like uncut velvet. His collections either embody a military subtext or offer a fresh, modern spin on the genderless trend. 
The brand and the man formed in 2010 with the idea of utilizing repurposed military garments to create excellent outerwear inspired by travel for the masculine urban explorer. 
Joseph, a successful boutique-turned-fashion-label, only launched its menswear extension five years ago, but is soaring thanks to its understated-yet-luxurious aesthetic headed by designer Mark Thomas (formerly of Givenchy and Neil Barrett).
This collection is pure London, complete with a Savile Row ancestry that dates back to the 1950s. Now, under the new design direction of Darren Barrowcliff, the collection aims to be a more innovative option for the more forward-thinking traditionalists. 
There's always something a little glam rock-star about creative director Jeremy Scott's Moschino.
He has a tongue-in-check approach to fashion that stands out in the industry—which at the moment is leaning towards subtlety. Scott's embrace of more-is-more can actually be refreshing. 
This longtime UK mainstay is coveted by gents looking for a dose of boyish Britishness (think: crisp, collarless shirts and perfectly-pleated trousers) with an emphasis on supreme-fit and subtle-detailing. 
There's never anything boring or expected about Eary's designs. She favors boldness, both in color and theme, and has attracted notable supporters such as Kate Moss and Kanye West (she actually aided him in the debut of his own fashion line). 

=== Title: These 10 Tips Will Help You Look Younger and Fresher This Fall - Bloomberg ===

This season, as you unpack sweaters and restock your sock collection, consider investing in a few new friends for your bathroom counter, too.
Weather and indoor conditions in fall and winter do different things to your skin and hair than what happens during the summer months, so you should be prepared. Just because your youthful tan will eventually be replaced by a more faded complexion, it doesn't mean you have to look older and more tired. 
We scored tips on putting your best face forward this fall from New York-based dermatologist Whitney Bowe, M.D., celebrity hair guru Jordan Blackmore, and makeup artist Emily Kate Warren.
 
Lightweight gels and lotions that kept you oil-free through the dog days of summer won’t cut it when the chill rolls in, said Bowe. You’ll want to seek out heartier products that lock in hydration, such as ClarinsMen Super Moisture Balm ($30, 
) which pulls double-duty as an aftershave soother. For seriously dry or chapped skin (after you’ve sat through a late-November football game, for instance) bring out big guns like Dr. Jart’s Ceramidin Oil Balm ($35, 
) which is packed with ceramides, or fat that traps water beneath skin. That moisture will keep your skin looking plump and will reduce visible wrinkles.
 
There’s a million reasons to exfoliate in colder weather (smaller-looking pores, brighter skin, more product absorption, increased cell turnover) and this oscilating brush does it better than your fingers. Clean-shaven guys should use it in the morning for a smoother razor glide and therefore, less burn and agitation. Clarisonic Alpha Fit ($189, 
) 
 
“A lot of us keep summer styles loose and easy because of the humidity, but fall hair should look a bit sharper. Pomades can give you that shine and hold,” said Blackmore, who uses Oribe Original Pomade ($39, 
) on his clients. (Small warning: pomades make it easy to run out the door with wet hair, but damp strands can become dry and brittle in the cold. Blackmore suggested applying coconut oil a few nights a week to keep hair hydrated and healthy.)  
 
You won’t have to compulsively apply balm this winter if you start prepping now with such ingredients as jojoba and shea butter. V76 Lip Balm ($13, 
) has all that viscous goodness but won’t leave lips shiny. 
 
Beards: still cool this fall. Not cool: prickly, itchy whiskers. A beard oil can remedy all that, and the scented varieties make this a kind of cologne for your face. Fan favorite Portland General Store Whisky Beard Oil ($30, 
) is made with organic hemp seed and marula oil, and it has a soft, masculine scent.
 
Now that your tan lines have faded, it’s a good time to nix any dark spots you picked up along the way, said Bowe. An even skin tone always makes you look younger and more refreshed. SK-11’s latest—the Power Brightening Specialist ($205, 
)— targets the spots you can see and those that are still hidden beneath skin. 
 
They’re good Instagram fodder (see: such celebs as 
 and 
) but cloth masks work even better as skin quenchers. “Masks are great for this transition period. They help to revitalize your dehydrated skin by infusing the skin with moisture while simultaneously creating a humectant seal to prevent the moisture from evaporating,” said Bowe. Try Karuna's variety of soothing masks. ($28 for 4, 
)
 
Sweater weather goes best with moodier makeup hues. If you’ve been scared of vampy lips in the past, now is the time to try: “This season I love a matte lip in a berry or wine tone,” said Warren, who recommends Nars Velvet Matte Lip Pencil (easy as using a jumbo crayon) in Damned. ($26, 
) 
 
Salt water, chlorine, and sun have likely wreaked havoc on your hair, but you can slip in some repair work (especially as blowout season gears up) with a cream that will remedy split ends and breakage. (Try Bumble and Bumble’s Repair Blow Dry, $30, 
). To do it yourself, Blackmore recommends a detoxifying apple cider vinegar rinse (three parts water, one part vinegar) followed by an avocado mask. Just mash up an avocado, blend it with coconut oil, and then let the mush sit on hair for 15 to 30 minutes.
 
Flushed cheeks (think: that perfect workout or ski slope glow) were a favorite on the fall runway, which means you can officially put away the St. Tropez. Tom Ford’s new Eye and Cheek Shadow ombre palletes ($65, 
) are perfect for blending a natural, rosy complexion. 

=== Title: Elba on Bond Role: ‘Daniel Craig Is Doing a Great Job’ - Bloomberg ===

Idris Elba drives fast, loves British cars, and rocks a well-cut suit.
That doesn’t mean he will play James Bond any time soon.
“It’s really just a rumor—and it’s not even my rumor!” he says via phone from Germany. He has called me, an auto journalist, because the luxury brand Jaguar recently hired him to drive from London to Berlin in its new XE diesel sedan, the one that gets 75 miles per gallon. He drove it to DJ a Jaguar-sponsored party the night of his arrival in Berlin.
It was a well-timed publicity stunt. While it is true that Elba has long followed car culture—his father worked for years at Ford, and Land Rovers and a Jaguar XJR are his current cars of choice—the drive comes right after revelations from the Sony hack revealed that Elba was being considered for the title role in the next 007 flick.
For the moment, Elba says he is focusing on his life as a DJ.
“I appreciate you saying that I’d be a good James Bond, but Daniel Craig is doing a great job with it right now,” he says. "I love working with music, making people dance."
In fact, Elba has worked in music for years, playing under the name Driis. He co-produced and performed on the intro to Jay-Z's 2007 album 
, and he earned a Billboard Music Awards nomination for his own EP, 
“I mostly taught myself to DJ, but I did used to lift the speaker boxes for my uncle when he would do weddings,” Elba says. “He was the first to really turn me on to it.”
These days, he plays chill and deep-house tracks mixed with pop and what he calls “party classics.” (Imagine Chromeo, Second City, and Chocolate Puma mixed with James Brown and Aluna George.) He also plays new work from such little-known (outside the U.K.) artists as Gorgon City and My Nu Leng.
Elba is enthusiastic. Last night, as part of a stunt, he drove the new XE right onto the dance floor. If you ask him, it was practically a normal day on the road.
“I’m a bit of a speed demon,” he admits, laughing. “But I am a safe driver! I haven’t been in any accidents.”
 

=== Title: Buy a Vintage Patek Philippe Ref. 9508 Lighter to Go With Your Watch - Bloomberg ===

Over the years, Patek Philippe & Co. has manufactured various accessories to complement its line of watches. Cufflinks, rings, wristbands, and repair tools are what you'll most commonly see in stores or on auction sites. But if you dig around, you can find other, rarer items that might just capture your imagination. 
A cruise through the collection at 
 auction, which will take place on March 17 in Dubai, shows a few interesting Pateks at a reasonable price, mixed in among Montblanc pens inset with emeralds or rubies ($3,000-$5,000), a trunk from Louis Vuitton with a built-in humidor ($25,000 to $45,000), and a set of crocodile Hermès Birkin bags estimated to sell for more than $35,000.
You may admire the 
 from Patek that is for sale for a suggested price of $26,000 to $36,000. The ref. 3940R-014 does, after all, have that familiar, elegant moonphase complication, applied pink gold batons, and 27 jewels. But it's not particularly expensive or rare for a Patek. 
There's also a white 
 with a mother of pearl dial. At $22,000 to $32,000, it would make a generous gift. 
Still, the fun item that caught my eye in this collection of luxury objects is an tiny, elegant, little bauble, also made by Patek, that has nothing to do with watchmaking. It's a cigarette lighter, but let's say we're not going to use it for smoking. You need to burn some documents, right?
The lighter is made with 18-karat yellow gold and green enamel. The auctioneers estimate that it was developed in 1977. The 40-millimeter-wide and 57-mm-long bauble is oval in shape and has a cylindrical scrolling bar on the outer edge, which is the lighting mechanism; you'll find that other Patek lighters look like this, though it is easier to find all-gold versions. The Patek packaging gives it a reference number of 9508, just like a watch.
Who knows who used this little trinket in the past 40-odd years, or how it ended up in this auction in Dubai? You'll have to create stories to go with the watch—and it will only set you back $1,000 to $2,000 to do so.
Seems a bargain to me.

=== Title: The Future of Fashion Is 3D Printing Clothes at Home - Bloomberg ===

When the doors open on May 5 for 
, the Met Costume Institute’s Spring exhibition, visitors will be treated to 90 otherworldly high-fashion garments, including many striking items made with 3D printing. These outfits—a layered, cross-hatched suit from 
 2015-16 Autumn/Winter haute couture line, an exotic, infinitely complex polyamide top in the Dutch designer
 Spring/Summer 2010 collection—are exotic now, but viewers should get ready to see a whole lot more of them in the not-too-distant future.
Currently (as evidenced by the fact that these dresses are in a museum display), 3D-printed clothes are pretty much the exclusive purview of haute couture. But as the technology is adopted by more apparel makers, it has the potential to trickle down to the masses. When that happens, “it can be as revolutionary as the sewing machine,” said Andrew Bolton, Manus x Machina’s curator. “It means you can 3D print your dress to your exact measurements at home.”
Couture clothes, in the traditional fashion industry definition, are “items made for you, that fit your body,” Bolton explained. Usually that means the garments are expensive, rare, and difficult to obtain. But with 3D printing, this extravagance will move into any home that has a printer. “Because it has the ability to mould exactly to your measurements, it’s environmentally friendly, too” Bolton said. “There’s no waste, whereas there’s always waste with textiles.”
Before you run out to buy a 
 for your next cocktail dress, keep in mind that 3D printing is still very much in its early stages. Such companies as 
, a Belgian software company that creates the technology for 3D printing and that helped create several of the dresses in the Met show, have the capability to make virtually anything a computer can model. But wearing that 3D-printed object is a different matter. “At the beginning, they were stiff, almost like body armor,” said Joris Debo, the creative director of Materialise. “Slowly there were changes to make the design more flexible.”
Even now, however, 3D-printed material can’t come close to a fabric like cotton, let alone Lycra. That means that at present, 3D printing’s fashion moment is directed toward (nonpliable) accessories first. “What you’re seeing more of is the market starting to work with accessories: hardware, jewelry, footwear, eyewear,” said Debo. “That’s where early adopters are going.”
Both Debo and Bolton said that before we see a head-to-toe 3D-printed outfit, there could first be a trend toward hybridization. “One area where I haven’t seen much growth is the combination of 3D printing with fabric,” said Bolton. “Like a structured, 3D-printed bodice, with a fabric skirt.” Debo compared it to the gradual introduction of electric cars. “Everyone is talking about a new industrial revolution, but I think of it as a normal evolution,” he said. “A mass production component will become a mass customized component.”
And what will it take for home-printed dresses to become a reality? “To my knowledge, there are a couple of companies working on this,” Debo said, pointing out that it would entail the printing of a natural fiber. “We’re still pretty far off.” Bolton echoes that sentiment, calling home-printing “a dream.” Yet both point to Iris Van Herpen’s more commercial designs as the first step. “It’s a slow process of adoption,” Debo said. “But of course, in the last two or three years, it’s changed quite rapidly.”

=== Title: Eleven Looks From the Original Jem Cartoon You Can Wear Today - Bloomberg ===

A few years ago, a good friend of mine dressed up as one of the most iconic women in pop music for Halloween. I was thrilled. As soon as I saw the big hair—the messy bed head with cotton candy pink streaks—and the copious amounts of body glitter and face paint, nostalgia hit me, and I squealed. 
“Oh my gosh, you’re Jem!”
I proceeded to sing the theme song from the mid-’80s cartoon to her. “Woo ooo 
 ….”
She stopped me, her glittered brows furrowed in confusion, “No, no, no Nic—I’m Kesha," she said holding up a bottle of Jack Daniels. “Who’s Jem?”
It was heartbreaking.
The millennial generation may have forgotten about 
, or never even knew about her, yet now the ’80s cartoon icon is back on screens with 
, a live-action film loosely based on the same premise. It makes its debut this weekend, and the reviews 
. But let's rewind the portable cassette player for a moment to the year 1985 and go over some important history: In the popular cartoon series, which ran for three seasons from 1985 to 1988, fictional teenage record executive (why not?) Jerrica Benton had an on-stage alter ego, the singer-songwriter Jem. To shift between the two, she grabbed her iconic earrings and set off a hologram that transformed her into a pink-haired rock star, complete with a set of rainbow-hued backup bandmembers. The accompanying dolls were all the rage for a couple of years. It was 
before Miley Cyrus was even born.
The fashions depicted in the cartoon were edgy and delightfully eighties, full of neon colors, asymmetry, and mismatched patterns. Because fashion is cyclical, many of these once-derided looks are now amazingly in style again. So, since you probably shouldn't go see the movie this weekend, instead treat your nostalgia with a look at some of Jerrica-slash-Jem's most memorable outfits. If you're feeling truly, truly outrageous, we have links to where you yourself can get the look.  
In the opening credits of the show, Jem introduces you to her signature color—pink. Whenever she wore the pink wig, eye shadow, and pumps, her character exuded strength and confidence. But her trademark long-sleeve metallic wrap dress was what shy little girls' dreams were made of.

Before Jerrica Benton tugged on her star-shaped stud earrings (dubbed the Jemstar earrings) and said the three magical words, 
to transform into her holographic glam-rock alter ego Jem—she was a high-powered, well-heeled record executive, who wore boardroom-appropriate coordinates in such gender-neutral hues as inky blue.

, $1,560; High-waist flared trousers by 
, $394.57; Pussy-bow silk-satin blouse by 
, $815.
After the catchy (and outrageous) theme song, the show's audacious use of color is easily its most memorable hallmark. Take the rival girl band The Misfits—they brought intrigue and drama not only to the storyline but to the show's style, with their flashy fashion choices that favored odd color pairings and textures as well as gaudy-yet-inventive statement jewelry.

, $495; Stretch-wool Bye coat by 
, $1,690; Flared slim trousers by 
, $818.20. 
But Jem (the show and the girl) was not all glamour and glitter. Offstage, as Jerrica, the titular character had a simple, quirky-but-casual style. She was the pre-Alexa Chung "it girl"—complete with a penchant for stripes and hats, with always a hint of androgyny. (Put simply, whatever she wore, we wanted.) As for her main squeeze Rio, he favored flattering (and keeping with the cast trend, colorful) basics such as fitted T-shirts and button-downs and lightweight outerwear pieces such as bomber jackets. 
Suede bomber jacket by 
, $995; Pocket T-shirt by 
, $90; Virgin wool and mohair striped sweater by 
, $330; Garnet starburst earrings by 
, $475.
Before Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing created his modern-day model army—which includes Kendall Jenner and the Hadid sisters—there was Jem and her band of rockstar sisters, The Holograms. They were the ’80s (and animated) edition of Taylor Swift's #squad—a troupe of bombshells proving that female friendship and super-flattering candy-colored frocks with aggressive shoulders and embellishments could be not only sexy but powerful, too.

=== Title: Is Now the Time to Buy a Case of Chateau Lafite? - Bloomberg ===

In 2011, Château Lafite Rothschild’s wines were riding high, the darlings of Chinese buyers and the auction market.
The futures price in London for the great 2010 vintage, released in July 2011, created shock waves. The wine was one of my top picks of the year, deep and rich, with classic tastes of cigar smoke and cassis and the texture of cashmere. 
But it was priced at £12,000 a case (then $19,400) … and the wine hadn’t even been bottled yet.
Almost immediately that price began to slip, and it’s been declining ever since. Last month, Liv-ex reported that a case of the 2010 had traded for £5,390 ($8,350), nearly 55 percent less than it cost four years ago.
My question: Should you scoop up a case—or three—now?
Read on.
The tale of 2010 Lafite shows what happens when a wine achieves cult status and then dips in fashion.
Lafite has always had a distinct mystique. In the now famous 1855 classification that ranked Bordeaux châteaux from fifth to first growths, it was named the first of the first growths. It’s Bordeaux’s most famous property, its wines the most elegant, with more finesse than power.
But that didn’t translate into astronomical prices until Chinese millionaires and billionaires caught the fever in about 2006, amassing huge stashes in their cellars.
Even in the week after Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, two Chinese buyers pushed prices of 165 lots of Lafite at a Hart Davis Hart auction in Chicago up and up. One of them purchased 50 percent of all the Lafite lots.
From August 2000 to August 2010, the famed 1982 vintage increased 1,137 percent in price, according to Liv-ex.
After an Acker Merrall & Condit sale in September 2010, Chief Executive Officer John Kapon told me Lafite was “a well-fed Godzilla,” getting stronger every month.
At a Sotheby’s auction in Hong Kong in October 2010, featuring wines direct from Château Lafite’s own cellars, a buyer bid four times the retail price of futures for the 2009. Bidders fought over three bottles of the 1869, which 
 sold for $232,692.
Liv-ex reported that most vintages of the pricey red were trading at 130 percent more than any other first growth.
I’ve been told the Chinese love of Lafite began because the name is easy to pronounce in Mandarin—it’s called “la fei” on the mainland. Some suggest it was the first wine to get noticed as being great. One theory points to 
, a popular 2006 Hong Kong gangster film, in which the hero spurns a wine because it’s not 1982 Lafite.
At the end of 2010, Andy Xie, an outspoken independent economist based in Shanghai, compared the rise in prices of wine to the dot-com bubble. He predicted Lafite, too, would crash and burn and advised selling immediately. By 2012, auction directors were admitting the bubble had burst.
What happened?
Buying patterns shifted. Burgundy was on the rise. The large counterfeit industry was busily purchasing empty Lafite bottles, and experts speculated that 70 percent of what was sold in China was fake. Political changes resulted in the government discouraging lavish gift-giving, which had helped boost Lafite.
So should you buy the 2010 Lafite now? Yes. The wine is great. The price has been steady at around £5,500 for the past few months, according to Liv-ex, whose charts show vintages since 2000 are at their lowest price in the past five years.
In fact, there are other expensive wines that can be had for “bargain” prices right now. Many other highly rated Bordeaux wines from the 2010 vintage have also slipped. The superb Pontet-Canet, for example, is down 26 percent from its peak in 2013. 
One tip: Look for excellent vintages that follow a great vintage. An example is the 2006 La Mission Haut-Brion, which is overshadowed by the more in-demand 2005. About eight months ago, according to Liv-ex, it was 68 percent below the peak price, but has started to rise.
You could apply these strategies to other less legendary regions, too.
When I asked famed Burgundy collector Donald Stott, who sold a large portion of his wines at Sotheby’s earlier this year, what he’d advise a Burgundy lover to buy now, he said he’d be looking at pinot noirs from Oregon.

=== Title: Mondaine to Offer Payment Chips for Watches at No Extra Charge - Bloomberg ===

Swiss watchmaker Mondaine has a solution for consumers who don’t always wear the same wristwatch yet want a smartwatch: a removable payment chip that can fit into other Mondaine timepieces.
Mondaine will start offering its PayChip, which can make mobile payments with NFC technology, as an extra for some of its watches for no added cost by August, Chief Executive Officer Andre Bernheim said in an interview at the Baselworld fair Thursday. They will first go on sale in Switzerland and may enter three other markets in Europe this year. The watches start at 200 francs ($206). 
The chip fits into a slot on the bottom of the strap and can be transferred to as many as 10 Mondaine watch models.
Mondaine is one of several Swiss watchmakers adding electronic functions to its watches as Apple Inc. encroaches into its territory. The watchmaker started selling its Helvetica Smart model for 850 francs last year, offering fitness and sleep-tracking features. 
Some Swiss watchmakers have been approaching smartwatches with a different tack, with Richemont’s IWC and Montblanc brands deciding to put the intelligent functions into the wristbands rather than the watch. That way, when the technology becomes obsolete, the owner can change the strap and keep the luxury timepiece.
“We’re looking into adding more intelligent functions into the strap in the future,” Bernheim said.

=== Title: NYC's Luxury-Condo King Shifts Gears in Bid for Chinese Buyers - Bloomberg ===

Gary Barnett, the developer who sold New York’s most expensive apartment, is marketing his newest and largest Manhattan condo project to Asian buyers first -- with prices well below those at his Billionaires’ Row towers.
Barnett’s Extell Development Co. will start sales of the more than 800 condominiums at his Lower East Side property exclusively overseas, including in China, Malaysia and Singapore, he said in an interview. Apartments at the 80-story tower, called One Manhattan Square, won’t be for sale in the U.S until early next year.
They also won’t be breaking any price records. Barnett estimates that most of the One Manhattan Square condos will be listed at $1 million to $3 million. Homes in that range are in 
 in Manhattan, where developers -- including Extell -- have focused almost exclusively on building larger and lavish apartments aimed at ultra-wealthy buyers who view New York real estate as a haven for cash.
“We think that’s a reasonable place to be,” Barnett said of the One Manhattan Square pricing. “There are a tremendous amount of people who would like to own something in New York City but are priced out because everybody’s building super-luxury.”
It was Barnett himself who ignited the development boom of high-end homes with the construction of One57, the 1,004-foot (306-meter) skyscraper across from Carnegie Hall on Manhattan’s west side. Extell began work on that project, planned as the city’s tallest residential tower, less than a year after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ushered in a real estate downturn.
The building reached $1 billion in sales after six months, including a contract to buy a penthouse for $100.5 million, the 
 ever paid for an apartment in New York history. That deal closed last year.
Other builders followed suit. Now at least eight residential properties aimed at multimillionaires -- including Zeckendorf Development Co.’s 
, Vornado Realty Trust’s 
 and another tower by Extell about one block from One57-- are under construction in or near Midtown, with the 57th Street corridor being dubbed 
. Manhattan prices overall reached a record of $1,497 a square foot in the third quarter, according to Miller Samuel Inc. and Douglas Elliman Real Estate.
While expensive homes are still drawing interest, the greater demand from places like Asia is for less pricey offerings, of which there aren’t many, Barnett said. Extell, which usually doesn’t outsource the sales and marketing of its properties, has hired 
 to sell One Manhattan Square’s units internationally, with exhibitions planned next month in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.
“There’s a tremendous hunger to purchase in New York for investment or for living or for safety or for a pied-a-terre,” Barnett said. “It’s hard to find something which is a good value and that more people can afford.”
The project at 252 South St., about a mile from New York’s Chinatown, will be the largest ever for Extell by number of units, he said. The complex will have 50,000 square feet (4,645 square meters) of indoor amenities that will include art studios for residents. Another 40,000 square feet of outdoor space will feature landscaped gardens and a "tea pavilion,” he said. The tower, which will be complete at the end of 2018, also will include smaller units, he said.
“There’s nothing really that’s crazy expensive,” Barnett said.
The firm agreed to buy the land, near the Manhattan Bridge and the East River, in January 2012 for $103.5 million, according to public records. The timing of that site purchase -- ahead of a spike in land prices brought about by the latest construction boom -- is what enables Extell to offer apartments there at lower price points.
“He was the first out of the box after the financial crisis to market super-luxury,” Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, said of Barnett. “If you take him to be a market leader, this is recognition of the next wave -- when it’s possible for developers.”
HFZ Capital Group’s Ziel Feldman and homebuilder 
 have also announced plans to build 
 as a way of satisfying a shortage in the Manhattan market.
For Extell, lower price points are a good strategy to attract buyers in China, after a currency devaluation in August made the cost of buying homes in the U.S. more expensive, Miller said. The devaluation, and the prospect of another, probably increased the appetite of buyers in the country, said Miller, who recently traveled to Shanghai to give presentations to real estate investors.
On New York listings website StreetEasy, 
 originating from China more than doubled in July from a year earlier. That was the same month that China’s security regulator banned major shareholders from selling stakes in listed companies for half a year.
“That just makes people more anxious to invest in a stable and secure and economically vibrant country,” Barnett said. “The United States fits the bill and New York City tops the list. We haven’t seen any slowdown in demand at all.”

=== Title: Eight Leather Sneakers to Buy Now and Wear Through Fall - Bloomberg ===

How rad was back-to-school shopping when you were a kid? Much more than a trip to the mall with mom (and that all-important stop at the food court Chick-fil-A), it was a mental restarter that encouraged some self-reflection. It became a yearly tradition unto itself: the annual opportunity to present the best version of you, anew.
Which is why I’m here to make the argument for a back-to-school shopping spree, adulthood edition. 
To get you started in your seasonal style revamp and get you thinking about how you are best going to tackle the end of the year, let's start with a strong base: killer shoes. Leather sneakers, to be exact.
Luxe ones. Ultra-minimalist, buttery ones. Smart ones that will work with your best transitional cotton suit or slimmed-down jeans. These eight pairs are casual enough for a late-summer cookout but put-together enough for the office. They will get you through both morning meetings and happy hours well into fall. 
This line of hybrid dress sneakers (sometimes referred to as just 
) has serious crossover appeal as a minimalistic color-matching design puts them on the dressed-up side of sporty. Wear these with a cotton suit—possibly your summer 
: slim, with little to no break in the trousers—or a pair of off-white denim or fitted cargo pants. 
 
British-born men's accessory designer 
 has teamed up with another up-and-coming designer and brand to watch, Antonio Ciongoli of

=== Title: You Are Going to See Floral Shoes on Men This Summer. Here’s the Deal - Bloomberg ===

Even if you are not a shoe guy, you will likely notice that a lot of casual shoes for men these days are being made with flowery prints. They might not catch your radar in stores (they are there), but you'll definitely start to notice them out and about as the summer progresses. From mass brands such as Zara and H&M to such upscale cobblers as Paul Smith and Giuseppe Zanotti, designers are churning them out. It's a response to a floral craze from last summer, when fashion houses employed the look on shirts, shorts, and even suits. It was like Prada, Gucci, and Saint Laurent held some sort of secret conference in 2013, in which the takeaway was that men 
 wanted to look like greenhouses full of exotic blossoms. From head to toe.
Don't be scared. It may seem foreign now, but you can be an early adopter of this trend. Just try to keep the rest of your outfit pretty simple—like a white button-down shirt and some dark denim pants or tailored chinos in a solid color. If the rest of your look is clean, monochromatic, and pattern-free, the shoes will do all the talking. Here are 10 that have something to say:
If you’re still not quite sure about splashing flowers all over your feet, best to take it slow. The palm fronds on pairs from Paul Smith and Marc Jacobs look almost abstract, but if you’re 
 on the fence, H&M’s leaf-print espadrilles will set you back only $17.99. (From left: $17.99, 
; $277.18, 
; $355.13, 
)
Those who’d like to ease into the trend can literally slip into Polo Ralph Lauren’s modestly priced sneaker. The all-over pattern and black background diminish the focus on the blooms themselves, so that all you’re seeing at first glance is a nice jolt of summer color. ($59, 
)
Yet another way to dip into the floral trend without risking ’70s hippy-dippy is to pick a relatively monochromatic pair. Givenchy’s leather skate shoes smatter small-scale buds in muted tones along a cream surface—subtle and perfectly suited for, well, a casual suit. ($450, 
)
Those who aren’t afraid of fire-engine red on their feet should snag these Vans lace-ups. The brand is a classic; the pattern certainly isn’t. And that’s why it works. Wear them to the beach with a great pair of swim trunks and a T-shirt and call it a day. Or at least a summer Friday. ($65, 
)
Sure, they’re bold, but they’re also breathable. Adidas Y-3 by Yohji Yamamoto delivers on its signature brand of forward-thinking sportswear with these mesh and canvas slip-ons. ($280, 
)
Who says Yoda and flora don’t go together? Vans’ offbeat pairing calls for closer inspection to pick out the Jedi Master hiding among the hibiscus. ($60, 
)
There are times when the invitation reads “creative black tie,” and these embroidered Giuseppe Zanotti slippers are tailor-made for them. And not much else. Pair them with a black, slim-cut tuxedo and a champagne coupe. ($895, 
) 
 You’re on board with florals, you wear high-tops unironically, and you want people to really notice that you’ve got lilies snaking up your ankles. Meet Pierre Hardy’s limited-edition sneakers, your new best bet for stopping traffic on Abbot Kinney Boulevard. Try them with a plain white T and light-colored denim to keep the focus on your feet (not that they need any extra help). ($527.57, 
)
 

=== Title: Five Khaki Suits to Buy Right Now (and How to Wear Them) - Bloomberg ===

This crisp poplin two-button suit by 
 is light not only in color but also in weight. Style tip: Channel the runways of Paris and Milan by keeping the look simple, and to the point, by pairing it with something white on top—such as a scoop-neck T-shirt with a pocket for casual cool or a lightweight white turtleneck when you're feeling more serious. 
The best part about a good khaki suit is that the relaxed fabric is super versatile and can be dressed up or down easily—even in a more adventurous cut, such as this peak lapel double-breasted option by 
. Style tip: Elevate the eased-up vibe by wearing it with a good pair of sporty, rubber-soled shoes. Try boat shoes, drivers, or tidy sneakers, like this black leather pair by 
. 
Sure you can wear a khaki suit as, well, a suit. But a unstructured version with casual details, such as a patch pocket and slim, notch lapels, like this one by 
, can also be worn separately to create even more dressed-down tailoring looks. Style tip: Cool down twice as much by wearing it with a classic Pima cotton polo (like this one by 
) instead of another shirt-and-tie combo. (Suit, 
)
This slightly yellow option by 
 is what I envision when I think of a true khaki-colored suit. It's modern in cut, but classic in taste, and with just the right amount of broken-in character. Style tip: When wearing all-over khaki, remember that a few wrinkles are fine, but anything more than a few is not. For those deep, hard-to-get-out creases, try a spritz (or two) of 
. (Trousers,
Blazer,
)  
Because cotton suits come off casual, it can be hard to find work-appropriate options. This sharply tailored one by 
 does the job, though, with a clean, pleated leg that will never make you feel underdressed. Style tip: Falling into the "loaded baked potato" trap (i.e. one topping, or accessory, too many) is easy when you're trying to dress fancier. All you need to make this suit work is a pristine summer dress shirt (I like these from 
, a silk knitted tie (
) and a pair of killer loafers. 
  

=== Title: Best Gifts for Drinkers: Bar Tools, Books, and Bottles - Bloomberg ===

Sure, it’s delicious, but you don’t 
 to splurge on a bottle from some exceptionally small batch of Japanese whisky when you’re shopping for someone who loves to drink. Below are a bunch of small and delightful gifts ranging from under $10 to $150 that can also do the trick:
 
You don’t have to be a hard-core Tiki enthusiast to appreciate these adorable, bright pink, mermaid-shaped swizzle sticks from the fantastic Chicago bar Three Dots and a Dash. But yes, it probably helps. 
 
Give the laziest martini lover in your life a bottle of bartending superstar Ryan “Mr. Lyan” Chetiyawardana’s ready-made cocktails to keep in the freezer, such as gin infused with olive and lemon-peel distillates. 
 
This gleaming, heavy-duty set is made from brass and includes the essentials: corkscrew, jigger, tongs, spoon, and bottle opener. 
 
Also ideal as a host gift, these glazed ceramic tile coasters are gorgeous and exactly the right size (4 inches by 4 inches). 
 
For the agave nerd in your life who cares about more than notes of smoke and brine, Chantal Martineau’s complex and thorough new book is a must-read. 
For the classic cocktail enthusiast, you can’t go wrong with a copy of Jerry Thomas’s 
. The reproduction of the 1862 book comes with an introduction by spirits writer David Wondrich. 
John Wright’s guide to home brewing touches on everything from beer and wine to cider and herbal spirits, making it perfect for the actual (or armchair) home brewer. 
 
Who can explain the recent appearance of copper pineapples everywhere? Not us. But for that friend who’s delighted by the trend, this 24-ounce version will be just the thing. 
 
Everyone can appreciate a jar from jam genius 
 of Sqirl in Los Angeles. This one, made from fresh figs soaked in La Clarine Farm’s biodynamic red wine, feels extra rich and special in the winter. 
 
You know the amaro freak, the one whose capacity for bitter, herbaceous, old-man-style drinks kind of shocks you? She’ll love this dry, fruity cider from Eden Ice Cider in Vermont, which is infused with red currants and bitters. 
 
Keep some clove- and cinnamon-infused sugar cubes on hand, and you can make classic Champagne cocktails anytime. (So ideally, give these with a bottle of something dry and sparkling on the side.) 
 
No, not to drink, but to moisturize your hands: A shea butter infused with absinthe botanicals, marjoram, and cucumber. 
 
Fruity rums like Plantation Pineapple Rum Stiggins’ Fancy can be OK (really!), especially when they involve a recipe from 1824 that calls for a boatload of pineapple rinds and results in something smooth and delicious. 
 
Forget about overpriced novelty flasks: This no-nonsense stainless-steel model from Stanley is sleek and practically unbreakable, and it does everything a flask is supposed to. Done. 
 
For the friend with a well-stocked bar and bookshelf? Go with a wee bottle of Tippleman’s ginger-y, spicy falernum syrup made from organic cane sugar. 
 
 
This massive, golden stainless-steel ice bowl can hold at least three full-size bottles with ice, and it also works for the friend who needs a proper punch bowl. 
 
This charming 8-by-10-inch wall print designed by Diana Kuan will look beautiful in a frame, and serve as an important reminder of how to elegantly toast in several languages besides English. 

=== Title: That Time the Prince of Monaco Met Buffalo Bill - Bloomberg ===

When Paris’s 
Museum of Hunting and Nature) opens its spring exhibition series on March 30, one of its biggest lenders will be none other than the princely house of Grimaldi, otherwise known as the current rulers of Monaco.
 (“A Prince on the Hunt”) comprises 30 paintings and close to 50 photographs in chronicling the two-decade-long hunting and fishing exploits of Albert I of Monaco, the enlightened and apparently adventurous ruler of the tiny Mediterranean principality from 1889 until 1922.
While most contemporary museum shows—including the Musée de La Chasse’s concurrent exhibition, 
—place some emphasis on the (art-)historical merits of their subject matter, the main draw of 
 seems to be the novelty of a European ruler boldly conquering the wilds of North America at roughly the same time that the Woolworth Building was topping off at 57 floors.
“He went on shooting trips to Yellowstone, where he met Buffalo Bill,” said Claude d’Anthenaise, the museum’s director. “He went to Canada to shoot elk, and a particularly interesting painting shows him hunting whales because he was especially interested in sea animals.”
While many of the prince’s contemporaries were also interested in the natural sciences, few expressed their interest by hunting down and killing their subjects. Fewer still had a retinue as they did so.
“There weren’t so many, less than 10 people,” said d’Anthenaise. “Two or three scientists, a few servants,” and the artist Louis Tinayre, whose paintings of the prince on horseback, on his yacht (from which he hunted those whales), and even on foot, standing contemplatively next to what appears to be a dead mountain goat, comprise all the paintings in the show.
While the subject matter is often gruesome, it is relatively standard fare for the Musée de la Chasse. Founded in the 1960s by François Sommer, a French industrialist who made his fortune with carpet factories, the museum is housed in a lovely 17th century mansion in the center of Paris’s Marais district. Its mission is to exhibit “the relationship between humans and animals through the ages,” which, until very recently, almost exclusively entailed the former killing the latter.
The museum is designed to look like a lavish private home; silk-wallpapered rooms are filled with 
, 
, and cabinets of 
 and other curiosities. “We tried to keep the spirit of the place like a private house museum,” said d’Anthenaise. “It’s like you’re visiting the home of a private collector.”
The 
 show fits right in. Many of the paintings were taken directly from the Château de Marchais, the Grimaldi family’s shooting estate in France, while others were lent by Monaco’s Oceanographic Museum.
D’Anthenaise imagines that the show, like the museum, will attract more art lovers than hunters.
“It’s seems odd, but hunters aren’t our most important group of visitors,” he said. “I think they prefer being in the countryside, rather than museums.”

=== Title: Lilia Brooklyn Review - Bloomberg ===

The agnolotti are having a good time, sliding around in saffron-streaked butter sweetened with honey. Pudgy and thin-skinned, each one is full of softly tangy sheep’s milk cheeses. It’s hard to say what’s more delicious: Could be this, or could be the chewy malfadini in fat, crimped ribbons, tangled up with heaps of Parmigiano, buzzing softly with pink peppercorns.
It’s all right, you don’t have to choose. You can order both.
Chef Missy Robbins came to New York from 
 in Chicago—where Michelle and Barack Obama twirled fresh pasta on their wedding anniversary—to take over 
. At these posh, corporate institutions, Robbins excelled with sleek, precisely rendered Italian fine dining. Now at 
, her new Brooklyn restaurant in a former body shop, things seem much more spontaneous and casual, but Robbins’s cooking is masterful.
First, there are the sorts of things you might like to meet at the end of a long day (at the end of any day, really) and linger over with a 
. This includes slices of excellent prosciutto to fold up with a blob of cheesy butter and mustard, and mozzarella salted with a snow of cured mullet roe. One of the best ways to start your meal at Lilia is with a few friends and an order of 
—many kinds of raw and cooked vegetables along with a dark, habit-forming sludge of anchovies and garlic to dip them in—kept nice and warm over a flame. 
When people go on about "good execution," this is what they mean. Even a basic bowl of pasta, dressed with cheese and pepper, can be infinitely better when put together with serious attention to detail, seasoned correctly, and brought out at the right temperature. You don’t immediately notice how much care has gone into Lilia's single-subject antipasti—grilled fennel dripping with olive oil and blood orange juice, almost-candied squash with pine nuts and pepper. And the best part is: No one wants you to notice. 
Though “meat” isn’t the most exciting section of the menu, its pleasures are consistent. There’s a chicken cooked over the grill, covered in a mellow slick of olives and mint, and a fantastic lamb steak under a sweet gravel of coriander seeds, kept just slightly rare in the center. (This steak is from the lamb leg but looks unfamiliar here, cross-cut right through the bone, which appears in the center.)
Robbins opened her 60-seat restaurant in January, in a freshly developed section of Williamsburg, and the restaurant was immediately slammed with diners. Service is enthusiastic and efficient, if generally overwhelmed. Book ahead, because if you try to get a same-week reservation, chances are the restaurant will have no free table until 10 p.m. or later. (The bar serves the full menu and is a fine place to eat if you’re a party of two just walking in.)
A second cocktail bar sits in back, where you can wait for a seat at the main bar. Sure, a bar where you wait for the bar is absurd, but it serves a few things from the main menu, including the 
 fritters. When these are just right, not overly browned, the center oozes cheese and the outside is crisp and greaseless. Between bites, you can sip your bubbly Franciacorta and almost forgive Lilia for seating someone before you who put a name down after you did.
In the morning, that second bar turns into a tiny coffee shop that sells buttery, crackling-topped cheese buns shot through with prosciutto and fontina, barely sweet cream-filled brioche, and squares of chewy focaccia with half-exploded grapes and fennel seeds. A woman waits by the door with her dogs, mouthing her order to a friend through the glass. Lean white couples in expensive workout clothes stop in for espresso and read the weekend paper on their phones, but they’re distracted by the prep cooks cutting pasta in the back. They calculate the number of calories they just burned, and by the time they leave, they’re already making plans to come back for dinner.

=== Title: Gabriela Princess zu Leiningen Jewelry Auction Geneva Christies - Bloomberg ===

On May 18, Gabriela Princess zu Leiningen, the former wife of the Aga Khan, will auction of 46 lots of jewelry estimated to bring more than $15 million 
.
The princess (born merely wealthy, she was first married to the Prince of Leiningen before marrying the Aga Kahn in 1998), received many of the jewels as gifts from her second husband, Christie's says.
When Rahul Kudia, Christie's head of jewelry, visited the princess, he first made his way below ground to the vault. "Awaiting us there was an impressive two-story safe from the turn of the century," inside of which, he wrote in a statement, "we glimpsed towers of neatly stacked boxes."
Most of the pieces come from notable jewelers. There are objects from Van Cleef & Arpels, Cartier, Schlumberger, and Tiffany's, and the majority include some form of prestigious history. Merely coming from the princess's own collection isn't a bad provenance, either. Here are the top 10 lots.
 
This massive, 36.09-carat diamond is mounted on platinum and tapered by baguette-cut diamond shoulders. 
:
$3.8 million to $5.5 million
 
The necklace features a detachable, cushion-shaped emerald pendant weighing approximately 39.7 carats; there are five more emeralds in the necklace weighing more than 16 carats in total. 
: $2.5 million to $3.5 million
 
The necklace, set with emeralds, sapphires, and rose-cut diamonds, is paired with a pair of emerald, diamond, and pearl earrings. The necklace was a gift from the princess's mother, Renate Thyssen. 
: $700,000 to $1 million
 
The two sapphires, weighing 24.69 and 25.63 carats are detachable; the diamonds are set in platinum. 
 $600,000 to $800,000
 
The sapphire weighs a massive 21.06 carats and is set in platinum between baguette-cut diamond shoulders. 
: $600,000 to $800,000
 
The necklace is a fringe of emerald beads interspersed with diamonds and pearls, suspended on a larger emerald and diamond pendant. The necklace is matched with a similarly-set pendant clasp, bracelet, and pair of ear pendants. 
$500,000 to $700,000
 
The necklace, whose yellow-gold flowers contain small diamond clusters, has 15 cultured pearls and multiple white gold clusters. The necklace comes with a similarly set bangle and pair of ear pendants. 
: $200,000 to $300,000
 
This flower brooch comprises rubies and a diamond-cluster pistil and is mounted in platinum and gold. 
: $150,000 to $250,000
 
Each ruby-set poppy flower has a circular-cut diamond pistil and two diamond-set leaves set in platinum. 
: $100,000 to $150,000
This "novelty" brooch, so-called because one side opens to reveal a watch with a circular dial, was once owned by Begum Sultan Mohamed Shah Aga Khan III (the princess's ex-husband's grandfather.) 
: $10,500 to $15,000

=== Title: How to Find the Less Expensive Hidden Gems on Any Wine List - Bloomberg ===

It might be the leather-bound doorstop at a Michelin-starred palace, or the tattered one-pager at the corner bistro.
Either way, wine lists can be tricky to negotiate—especially if you’re determined to pick out hidden gems.
Finding steals in the cellar can be a particular challenge at destination restaurants, their collections groaning with pricey trophy bottles from Bordeaux or Napa Valley. But when even neighborhood joints reliably mark up wine by 250 percent to 300 percent, homing in on the overlooked or underrated can help a diner stave off sticker shock when the check arrives.
“If you dine at serious wine restaurants, there are always great alternatives and values on the list,” says Joe Bastianich, whose 30 restaurants around the world include New York’s Del Posto and Babbo. “A $1,200 Grand Cru Burgundy is great, but you can also find a $120 bottle of village wine that will turn your world around.”
Bastianich, the restaurateur, wine expert, and television cooking personality, has seen his share of top-heavy wine lists. But he says places that truly care about customers will balance even superstar rosters with underdogs that anyone can root for. “We’re not there to rip people’s lungs out—we’re there to make them love wine.”
While in the past the upsell might have been a key part of a sommelier’s duties, the field has come to view the practice as tacky and beside the point.
“We’re way past the time when sommeliers were there to get you to spend more,” says Dustin Wilson, a master sommelier (you may remember him from the film 
) who has run the wine department at Eleven Madison Park in New York. “At the end of the day, seeing that look on the customer’s face, that ‘wow’ factor, is more fulfilling than having them spend an extra $20.”
We asked Wilson and Bastianich for their best advice on how to dig deep into a wine list and find the less pricey treasures buried within. Here are some simple rules to follow:
At that expense-account steakhouse, don’t just stab a finger in the direction of the nearest Napa cabernet sauvignon. Instead, cast an explorer’s gaze beyond the safe, big-name growing regions 
. You may be aware of the viticulture boom that has dramatically boosted quality and choices from Spain, Greece, Chile, and South Africa. But don’t overlook the up-and-comers in familiar nations, either.
Do you go for spicy, earthy French reds? Those lip-smacking flavor profiles are a signature of the increasingly popular Corbières, which is an appealingly affordable expression of the carignan grape, in the Languedoc-Roussillon along France’s Mediterranean coast.
In Italy, you’ll find winners from
once-overlooked regions such as Calabria, Umbria, Sardinia, and Sicily.
“If you move outside mainstream areas, you’ll find interesting wines for a fraction of the price of the popular varietals,” Wilson says.
Perhaps counterintuitively, the cheapest and most mass-produced bottles on a list—your supermarket chardonnays and pinot grigios, forgettable merlots, and insipid Chiantis—are typically marked up the most in terms of percentage. They’re not deals at all, yet they often fly out of the cellar because people know them.
Wilson pegs the sweet spot on a well-curated list at roughly $60 to $200. That’s where you’ll find the gems, with more flavor, 
, and distinction than big-name, like-priced alternatives. These more esoteric wines don’t sell as well as high-profile counterparts, and that’s your edge: Restaurants price them relatively lower to lure customers.
Indigenous grapes that fell into obscurity, or were nearly wiped out by Europe’s phylloxera aphid blight in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, are staging a remarkable comeback.
Bastianich cheers Italy’s renaissance of native grape varietals: the light-bodied, vivacious petit rouge reds of Valle d’Aosta, nestled in the Alps in Italy’s smallest viticultural region. Or the bright and crisp whites of pecorino—the wine, not the cheese—farther south in Abruzzo.
In Spain, which has more acres under grape cultivation than any other country, the underdogs include mencia, whose herbal bouquet blast recalls cabernet franc; or the tempranillo that produces Rioja, the relatively affordable Old World red whose finest expressions stand tall against any Bordeaux.
Greeks are rightly proud of their assyrtiko, the delightfully minerally, bone-dry white grape that first sprouted in the volcanic island soil of Santorini; or the citrusy, full-bodied whites of malagousia.
In Portugal, the touriga nacional, with its firm tannins and dark, leathery concentrated fruit, is an affordable place to zig when others zag to cabernet sauvignon.
Almost every region has hidden gems tucked among their more famous wines, Bastianich says.
Bastianich and Wilson both extol the tannic, black-skinned freisa grape (pronounced “FRAY-zuh”) as a bargain red alternative to the exalted barolos and Barbarescos that hog the glory of Italy’s Piedmont region.
Grignolino, Bastianich says, “is another way to enjoy the best of Piedmontese terroir at a fraction of the price.”
Rather than breaking the bank with Côte-Rôtie, the exalted syrah from the northernmost tip of France’s Rhône Valley, Wilson steers people to the similar, 100 percent-syrah pleasures of the St. Joseph appellation, just a short trip down the Rhône river.
Lovers of New World pinot noirs are well versed in the pleasures of Oregon’s Willamette Valley or California’s Sonoma coast. But farther south, California’s Monterey County, Santa Ynez Valley, and Santa Barbara County are producing knockouts for typically less money.
Sure, taking a chance on a mystery wine sounds great on paper. Yet wine drinkers, once they’ve settled into a style like a comfy Barcalounger, can be hard to coax out of it.
“People are afraid to go out of their comfort zone, because they don’t want to send a bottle back,” Wilson says. But to get a deal, “you have to be willing to experiment.”
With inspired winemakers cultivating the grapes, consumers do well to cultivate that sense of adventure. Ask the sommelier for something new to you.
To avoid getting lost in unknown terroir, customers need to help a sommelier out. Be straight-up about which varietals or styles you tend to like: a white wine, unoaked, in the $70 range; perhaps a full-bodied red with some age on it for around $120. Don’t be shy about setting price boundaries. Or, simply point to a bottle on the list to discreetly suggest what you’re looking to pay.
“Give the sommelier the price point and what you want, and make it their problem,” Bastianich says.
A good sommelier, Wilson says, “can take what you like and extract that information, and extrapolate it to wines with similar traits, yet something totally new.”
If a sommelier steers you out of that comfort zone, and you really don’t care for the wine that he or she has essentially chosen, it’s OK to send it back, Wilson assures. After you taste the wine, “if you’re just not into it, say so and say what it is that you don’t love,” he says. “Any respectable sommelier will take that information and find something more to your liking.”
Of course, there are times when your gut is telling you to stick with a known quantity–but you’d still like to watch the budget. Our experts recommend choosing the lesser designations of a highly reputed winemaker.
One of Wilson’s all-time favorites is a syrah that, on paper, is a humble table wine. Yet it’s produced by the acclaimed Domaine Jamet, just a few hillsides over from the primo Côte-Rôtie appellation. The result is a wine whose quality and character defies its 
 classification.
Diners don’t think twice about asking for the gems on the food menu, Wilson says. But they can still be like men who need directions: They’ll do anything to avoid asking for wine advice.
If you tend to feel rushed and under-the-gun with wine list in hand, and dining partners hanging on your selection, call the restaurant in advance to walk through the list. They won’t feel put upon, Wilson assures. Most sommeliers are flattered to show off the literal fruits of their labors. In the end, it’s a chance to talk wine with a fellow enthusiast.
“That’s the fun part of being a somm,” Wilson says. “You’ve done some serious work to get the wine in front of the guest, and you’re pretty stoked about it.”

=== Title: Exo Cricket Protein Bars Closes Series A With Rapper Nas, Top Chef - Bloomberg ===

Imagine eating a cricket. Does the crunch of an exoskeleton and a warm burst of guts come to mind? 
 wants you to think of Michelin stars.
The Brooklyn-based startup announced Monday that it closed a $4 million series A funding round to bring chef-created cricket-flour foods to the masses. Investors include AccelFoods, the Collaborative Fund, and the rapper Nas. The company, which sells the bars online and at Whole Foods and Wegman's, plans to use the money to boost its retail presence. It's also working to launch new products based on cricket flour, such as ready-to-eat shakes and protein powers, to help appeal to fitness buffs—especially those cross-fitters and paleo-diehards who help make up the company's current core market—and consumers who avoid eating meat for ethical or health reasons. 
"In the long term, we envision cricket powder being competitive with soy, and whey, and any other protein source," Exo co-founder Greg Sewitz, 24, said via phone. "That starts with introducing cricket protein to a consumer base with no direct experience with it and a lot of preconceived ideas that were negative."
For that, they've turned to Kyle Connaughton. He may not be a household name, but he's something of a food-world star
            

         and has been developing palate-tempting recipes for Exo's cricket-flour protein bars for the past three years. In 2013, before Exo had sold a single bar, a mutual friend introduced the chef to Sewitz and fellow cricket evangelist/co-founder Gabi Lewis (the duo used to hand out cricket-powered snack bars during Brown University 
). Armed with a United Nations report on eating insects (
) they argued that compared with beef, poultry, and other animal proteins, cricket farming produces far more protein per gallon of water or pound of feed. Citing a passage from 

            

        , they claimed crickets should be considered kosher as well. (Though ironically, crickets may trigger crustacean shellfish allergies.)
Connaughton needed no cricket conversion. In 2009, he and Heston Blumenthal teamed up to create an 
 for a British television show
. (Connaughton used to run the experimental kitchen at the chef's award-winding 
.) They used a syringe to inject a thick tomato sauce into the bellies of fried crickets. “It had a great fried crunch and a delicious liquid center that really challenged people,” Connaughton said in an interview. 
His role in this sustainable protein partnership is arguably the lynchpin: to help make Americans get comfortable with the idea of 
—aka insect eating, which 80 percent of the world does, according to 
—and to make the company's products tasty enough that people who try one come back for seconds. The first challenge, he said, was getting into the mindset of people who eat protein bars. “From a chef’s perspective, I’m around food all day," Connaughton said, "so trying to supplement regular food with a protein bar isn’t that much part of my lifestyle.”  
Cooking with cricket flour turns out to be relatively straightforward. Wheat flour, for instance, contains gluten that helps produce a chewy texture (while making faddish consumers shudder). Exo’s cricket flour has what Connaughton calls a "low culinary function," meaning its doesn't do much on a structural level. Instead, nut butters are used as a base and binder, although more than half the protein in the bars (10 or 11 grams, depending on the recipe) still comes from crickets. There are about 40 bugs in every bar. 
Roasting crickets at high temperatures is the fastest way to make flour, but that process can impart a strong taste and aroma. Instead, Exo freezes, then dehydrates the bugs in a multistep process that results in neutral-tasting powder. The company is also experimenting with other techniques to affect the taste and function of cricket flour, Sewitz said. The insects are small enough that feeding them a steady diet of carrots, say, or apple can change the taste and color of the cricket flour.
For now, Exo's crickets are raised on a diet of organic grains and filtered water and sourced from farms in the U.S. and Canada that have cropped up in recent years to supply an increased demand for insects raised for human consumption. Specialty producers such as Entomo Farms, in Norwood, Ontario, and All Things Bugs, in Athens, Ga., are milling insect flours for Exo and competitors (Salt Lake City's Chapul sells bars and Portland, Ore.-based Cricket Flours has products that include cake mix). The market for meal replacement products, including shakes and bars, expanded to $3.2 billion last year, from $2.1 billion in 2006, according to IBISWorld.
“We looked at the development of these bars the way a chef looks at creating a new restaurant dish,” Connaughton said. That meant using nut butters instead of the brown rice syrups many energy bar makers rely on, as well as eschewing clichéd flavor analogs such as brownies or cookie dough
            

         and taking chances on such savory concepts as mango curry and barbecue.  
For a Mediterranean-styled bar marketed as a salve for “all your ultimate umami cravings,” Connaughton tested 15 types of sundried tomatoes and various techniques for blanching olives. After nailing the flavor on a small scale, Connaughton’s development kitchen at 
 took on the grueling process of adapting the recipe for mass production and a particular set of nutritional guidelines. Eight months and dozens of recipes later, they had a final formula incorporating almonds, tahini, sea salt, and sesame seeds and a price point around $3.50 a bar. 
Despite the real ingredients and top chef, a bar is still a bar. Pursuits restaurant critic Tejal Rao thought the Mediterranean bar was "weird and malty"; Exo's cocoa nut bar tasted "very healthy, in a lean, punitive" way; and the blueberry-vanilla had a "paleo Fig Newton thing going on." Rao liked the barbecue flavor best, she said. "It tastes exactly like barbecue chips."

=== Title: Costco Heir Aims to Create New Napa Cult Wines in 1,403 Steps - Bloomberg ===

Jumping on new entries in the Napa Valley cult cabernet sweepstakes is an insider sport. If you want to grab bottles of the latest wine, you have to nail a spot on the winery’s mailing list as early as possible. That way you’ll be notified about releases and have the chance to place an order for those pricy bottlings—which you may be able to flip later for big profits. 
Normally these cabernets start at $150 and climb to $850. But on Sept. 30, one estate is releasing a first wave of cabernet bottles for less than $100. That’s well below a typical high-profile cab IPO. So what’s the story?
“My big vision,” says 
 owner David Sinegal, “is to create a luxury experience where the product is just one part. That’s where everything is going.” 
By entering onto the Sinegal mailing list, you not only get access to those lower-priced bottles. You also gain access to the 30-acre historic wine estate in St. Helena. He purchased it two years ago for $17 million and spent another $8 million in refurbishing and expanding hillside caves for aging the wine. If you’re a member of this select group, which is more like a club, you’ll be able to make appointments to taste, eat, and while away time at the pool. (Or the lake. Or gazebo.)
The property is, I admit, knockout gorgeous. It started life in 1879 as the Inglewood estate, and it’s the kind of spot you imagine when dreaming of slipping into the Napa Valley lifestyle. The yellow Victorian house with its big front porch, built in 1881, came with an old stone winery, nine and a half acres of organic vines, a tennis court, a private lake with rowboats, gardens, olive trees, and smooth green lawns dotted with giant palms and ginkgo trees. 
It seduced Sinegal, who’s 50 and on his second family. (You may recognize the last name—his father, James Sinegal, was a co-founder of Costco.) David had no experience growing grapes or making wine, but during his own 20 years at Costco he’d overseen all buying, including of wine. Stints consulting to Starbucks and Pepsi and running his own company followed, and finally he wanted out of Seattle and into the wine business. “I love the art and act of making things that are unique and special,” he says. 
Like so many others, he headed to Napa for a better lifestyle, less rain, and great terroir. 
Sinegal had a style of wine in mind. Not the usual high-alcohol Napa cabernet with gum-sucking tannins and swagger, but one rich and balanced and ready to drink in less than 12 years. His point of reference?  The highly regarded, notably elegant St. Helena Spottswoode cabernet. 
OK, he’s not there yet.  But he tells me he’s figured out it takes precisely 1,403 steps to get to a great wine. Seriously. How did he come up with that figure?
He zeroed in on the major aspects of grape growing and winemaking, and his top talent team—winemaker Tony Biagi (formerly at Plumpjack, now at Hourglass), veteran viticulturalist Jim Barbour, and consultant Craig Williams (former maker of Phelps Insignia)—brainstormed to develop a list of micro-actions for each part of the process. For example, they give different amounts of water to each individual vine. They divide even small vineyard blocks into two-ton lots so they can harvest grapes in perfect condition. They even get goats to do the weeding between the vines. All this deep analysis takes the latest wine buzz term, “precision viticulture,” to a whole new level. 
The first two wines being released, from the 2013 vintage, are surprisingly good. The cabernet comes in the super heavy bottle now de rigueur for very expensive New World red vino. The simple label logo is a copy of the original antique key to that Victorian house where Sinegal and his family now live. 
At $90, the estate cabernet is as good as some Napa cabs that cost nearly double that. Big and rich, it’s smooth and concentrated, with notes of tobacco and cassis, a silky texture, and dark, spicy fruit. It’s more balanced than many of the valley’s expensive cabs, too, though it lacks a bit of brightness and lift. Only 700 cases were produced. The sauvignon blanc ($45) is chalky and layered, rich and complex.  
(Next up? The 2013 reserve cabernet, offered as futures last spring, which will be released next February, costs $195; ditto a 2013 cabernet franc at $140.) 
If you sign on to the mailing list now, you can purchase as few or as many bottles as you want of the estate cabernet and sauvignon blanc—and you’ll automatically get a notification of future releases, when you’ll get a chance to sign up for one of three tiers of membership. The lowest level includes six bottles of estate cabernet and three bottles each of reserve cabernet and cabernet franc per year for $1,545. The second tier gets you double those numbers of bottles for $3,090, and the top level, Tier 1881, throws in more reserve cabernet and magnums of all three reds for $5,200. 
And being on the mailing list entitles you to those winery visits—limited to 21 people a day. 
Sinegal is part of a new trend of how Napa’s luxury cab startups, which formerly relied on collector buzz, are using the lure of exclusive experiences to build a fan base. 
I guess they’re on to something.  Last year, a report by Boston Consulting Group said that experiential luxury accounts for 55 percent of global luxury spending. 
My bet is that Sinegal’s project has staying power because it’s more than a luxury cab invented out of branding and marketing concepts. It’s rooted in a special vineyard and terroir with a fine-wine history behind it.  You can’t gin that up in a marketing room.   

=== Title: Ten Skinny Wallets to Help You Battle the Bulge - Bloomberg ===

You don't need to be carrying around everything that's in your wallet right now. I promise. Whether it's stuffed with a membership card to someplace you haven't visited in years, insurance information that could be stored in your phone, or a wad of cash that makes you look like a drug dealer, your billfold could stand to go on a beach-season diet. Keeping a bulky lump in the same back pocket every day can even screw up your back and create imbalances in your body you won't be aware of until they become painful or affect your exercise. 
The best slim wallets give you just enough space for the credit cards you use every day, a driver's license, and one or two safety-blanket extras. Here are a few options to help you cut back ASAP.
If this whole concept intimidates you, start here. There's a slot on each side that can hold up to three cards, plus you can cram some cash down in the middle pocket. Simple, right? Plus, Lotuff stitches all its leather goods at its New England workshop, so you know you're getting something that will last. 
 (
)
This one takes some explaining. TGT (pronounced "tight") has created a wallet that combines a leather pouch to hold cash or even a key with an elastic strap to keep all your credit cards tidy. As you slip more in, the wallet expands, and it can easily hold half a dozen cards, some bills, and your apartment key. Now you just have to resist the temptation to overpack it. 
 (
)
Just because you're carrying less doesn't mean your wallet should be any less beautiful. The v-shaped cut-outs here are more than just the Milanese brand's trademark: They actually make it easier to pull your cards out of the slots without stretching out the pebbled leather. Piping at the edges keeps everything tidy, and the off-white color is as handsome as it gets. 
 (
)
If  the out-in-the-open design of most cardholders doesn't appeal, you can always grab something like this Brooks Brothers card case, which covers your cards with a tie-silk-adorned flap so nothing falls out. The extra room is also helpful if you're the sort who hates loose change jingling around or just want some extra breathing room. 
 (
)
It doesn't get any simpler than this wallet. It's one piece of leather, creatively cut and sewn into a single pouch for your most necessary cards and cash. You can opt for either shell Cordovan or Chromexcel leather, both from Chicago's Horween tannery, but either option is sturdier than what you're carrying now. 
 (
)
The folks in Detroit are also using Horween leathers but this time in a combination card case and money clip. You keep the plastic on one side and tuck the bills into the attached clip on the other side. Each wallet is embossed with a unique serial number, and the colors are mellow enough to be stylish well past the end of the summer. 
 (
)
For when you really want to leave all but the essentials at home. Snap the Solo onto your iPhone, and you can tuck your ID and a credit card into the back slots. That's it. Maybe you can squeeze that paper-thin Metrocard in, too, but don't push it any further. The whole point is learning to make do with less. (For the George Costanzas out there, we understand you need to take baby steps.) 
 (
)
As you're changing out your leather shoes for canvas sneakers (or your 
), you can add some textile to your wallet too. The crossed leather panels on the front of this cardholder gives you some additional separation, while the canvas body keeps it light and flexible. There are some extra slots on the back if you need more space. 
 (
)
It might look like carbon fiber, but Dunhill's Chassis cardholder is actually leather that's embossed to mimic the high-tech material. It's crazy slim and will force you to be choosy about what you load into it. Pro tip: This would look great pulled out of a linen tuxedo. Just saying.  
 (
)
The CdG zip wallets have achieved something of cult status over the past half decade or so, and these new fluorescent colors add a little personality to the basic design. Think of it as a halfway point between a traditional wallet and a credit-card case. It's still smaller (and cooler) than that tri-fold you're packing.

=== Title: Two Easy (but Crucial) Steps for Making the Best Burgers at Home - Bloomberg ===

As I flipped the pancake-thin patties at my son’s school picnic, I knew they embodied everything that can go wrong with a burger–chewy, dense, and underseasoned. 
Staring into the flames, I thought of a burger I’d recently devoured at 
 in San Francisco: It was an inch-thick, lightly packed round of ground beef topped with a sheer slice of Comté and sweet-and-sour onions. Each half of the toasted potato-buttermilk bun was smeared with tangy aioli. Crisp butter lettuce buffered the bun from the meat drippings. 
The man responsible for that exceptional burger is Jason Berthold, the boyish executive chef of Corey Lee’s French-inspired bistro, who I met on a recent trip to the Bay Area. 
To make it, Berthold grinds the beef, bakes the buns, and even makes his own ketchup (for the record, it’s the closest I’ve tasted to Heinz). But I wasn’t there to learn how to make ketchup. I met Berthold in his pristine, white-tiled kitchen to master the pro patty in my home kitchen. 
It starts with grinding your own beef. Berthold pulled meat-grinding tools and a stainless steel bowl from the freezer. From the walk-in came a large sheet pan of top round and short-rib plate (a slab of short ribs, sans bones, from the front of the cow). 
Some people freeze the meat before grinding to keep it from softening, as the heat of the machine can smear the fat into the leaner meat. Keeping the lean and fatty pieces separate is what gives the patty a loose texture—the fat melts as it cooks, leaving behind juicy airy pockets. But
as long as you work quickly and the beef and tools are well chilled, Berthold said, freezing the meat isn’t necessary.
He dropped strips, not cubes, of meat through the grinder—first a piece of leaner top round, then a fattier short-rib plate. Once ground, he passed all the meat through the grinder a second time to mix it. The fat content of this burger is high—probably 30 percent—which means plenty of flavor and moisture.
As Berthold shaped the patties, he pressed his thumb into the center of each one, creating a divot in the beef. Since the patties constrict with
heat
these divots prevent the meat from puffing up
into tennis balls.
Before Berthold started cooking his burgers in an enclosed grill called a Josper (think oven with a grill inside), he basted the patties like steaks, with butter and herbs in a cast-iron skillet. Cast-iron cooking, some think, makes for a more flavorful burger because the fat and salt stay in the pan and continue to season the patty. I tried a burger cooked both ways, and while the Josper burger
was smokier, the skillet version was equally moist and tender. 
Back in my city kitchen, I chose to reproduce the most important parts of Berthold’s burger and found that grinding the burger through a thick die either at home or at a butcher is crucial. It keeps the meat loose and lets you decide the quantity of fat to lean meat as well as tailor the flavors: earthy, nutty marbled short ribs; sweet, leaner top loin; buttery brisket; or beefy skirt steak. 
Keeping the meat cool until you’re ready to cook it and salting it just before it hits the pan is also important, as this is key to retaining moisture. Berthold sprinkled a lot of kosher salt
over his patties. “It should look like a light dusting of snow on your car window–just enough so that you can’t see through it,” he said. 
This was perhaps the biggest take away: Season your patties and then season them again. (Then don’t forget the divot.)
And while it takes willpower not to immediately bite into the burger, give it a good five-minute rest after cooking. Otherwise, the juices will run out of the patty and onto your perfectly toasted bun.  
The caramelized onions and the aioli offer nice acidity, so I included those parts of the recipe, but you could certainly skip the onions, use store-bought mayo, and walk away a very happy person. I took those shortcuts one busy night. It was a fast, no-nonsense dinner with toasted Martin’s potato rolls, smears of Hellman’s mayo, and a seriously tender, juicy, well-seasoned patty—the perfect burger night. 
 
Makes 4 burgers, 1 cup caramelized onions, 1 cup aioli
Active Time: 1 hour, 30 minutes
Total Time: 1 hour, 45 minutes
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium yellow onions (about 1 pound total), sliced ¼ inch thick
1 small bay leaf
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon fine salt
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons Banyuls vinegar
1 clove garlic
1 large egg
1 additional large egg yolk
2 teaspoons Champagne vinegar
1½ teaspoons Dijon mustard
¼ teaspoon fine salt, plus more to taste
1 large pinch piment d’espelette powder
¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons rice bran oil (grapeseed or canola oil can also be used)
14 ounces boneless short-rib plate (well-marbled, untrimmed, from the forequarter), cut into 1-inch-thick strips (see NOTE)
14 ounces top round, cut into 1-inch-thick strips
1 small yellow onion
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Rice bran oil (grapeseed or canola oil can also be used)
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cloves garlic, smashed
2 sprigs thyme
4 (4-inch) slices Comté
4 potato or brioche hamburger buns
4 leaves butter lettuce
1. 
 Set a large sauté pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Once hot, add the onions and bay leaf and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. 
2. Add the sugar, salt, butter, and vinegar and cook, stirring constantly to emulsify the butter into the vinegar, about 1 minute. 
3. Cut a parchment round the width of the pan, then cut a 1-inch hole in the center. Place it directly on the onions and cook over low heat until softened but not completely melted, 6 to 8 minutes more. Remove bay leaf and cool. 
4. 
 Fill a medium sauté pan with enough cold water to rise 2 inches and bring to a boil. Add the garlic and boil for 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to a blender. 
5. Let the boiling water sit off the heat for about 4 minutes to lower the temperature to between 170F and 190F. (Turn the heat back on as needed to keep the temperature in this range.) Place the whole egg in a small bowl. Holding that small bowl over the water, dip and tip it slightly in the water and let the egg slide smoothly out. Gently agitate the top of the water with a spoon so the egg doesn’t stick to the bottom. Cook until the outside white has set and the inside yolk has heated through, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in the blender.  
6. Add the egg yolk, vinegar, mustard, salt, and piment d’espelette to the blender and puree until smooth. Add the oil in a slow and steady stream to emulsify, stopping to wipe down the sides of the blender. Season to taste with more salt.
7. 
 Fifteen minutes before grinding the meat, place a medium bowl and the meat grinder attachment and blades in the freezer. (If you cannot fit them in the freezer, place them in the fridge until well-chilled.)
8. Using a die with ¼-inch-thick holes, grind the meat through the meat grinder, alternating between pieces of short-rib plate and top round. Grind the meat through the meat grinder a second time. Chill the meat until ready to use.
9. Slice the yellow onion into 1/3-inch rings and place them in an ice water bath; set aside.
10. Press 7 ounces of ground meat into 4 patties (4½ to 5 inch in diameter each). Use your thumb to press an indent in the center to keep the burger flat as it cooks. Chill until ready to cook.
11. If using the stovetop, heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Once hot, remove two burger patties from the refrigerator. Season generously with salt and pepper—enough salt so that it looks like a light dusting of snow. Add just enough oil to coat the pan. Once the oil is hot, add the burger patties and cook without moving until dark brown on the bottom and 60 percent of the sides are no longer pink, about 4 to 5 minutes. Flip, drain off all but 1 tablespoon of fat, add 2 tablespoons of butter, 1 garlic clove, and 1 thyme sprig and cook, using a basting spoon to constantly spoon the butter, garlic, and thyme over the burgers until medium-rare or the internal temperature is 130F, about 1 minute more. Add a slice of Comté to each burger and cover the pan with a lid to melt it quickly, for about 30 seconds. Transfer the burgers to a cooling rack and let sit for 5 minutes. Repeat step #11 with the remaining two burger patties.
12. If using a grill, set a gas grill to high heat or heat the coals in a charcoal grill until they turn bright orange with a layer of ash over them. Once the grill is very hot, set the burgers on the grill grate and cook until dark brown and char marks form, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more. Add cheese to each burger, cover the grill, and let cook for 1 to 2 minutes more until the cheese has melted and the internal temperature is 130F for medium-rare.
13. Toast the hamburger buns. Spread about 1 tablespoon of aioli on each side of a burger bun. Lay a slice of lettuce on the bottom half, place the burger over it, then roughly 2 tablespoons of caramelized onions, then a sliced onion (pulled from the ice water bath and patted dry), and finish with the top bun half.
 A meat grinder or an electric mixer meat grinder attachment is useful. (If you don’t have a meat grinder, ask a butcher to grind the meat twice using a thick 3/8 or ¼-inch thick die.)
 Ask for the well-marbled, thinner portion of the short-rib plate from the tip of the ribs (forequarter). If you cannot find this cut, you can substitute 2 parts boneless regular short ribs to 3 parts fatty brisket, or 1 part skirt steak to 2 parts fatty brisket to 2 parts chuck or sirloin.

=== Title: Dubai Restaurant Guide: Great Food Picked by Chefs and Locals - Bloomberg ===

Dining in Dubai is like iTunes: Get just the hits and avoid the filler.
Restaurateurs are drawn by the relatively easy money: They can recycle concepts and dishes while giving their chefs overseas experience. But that's good news for diners, because some of the best restaurants from around the world are just a taxi ride away.   
If the fancy restaurants tend to be derivative and expensive, they are still generally good. And you can eat very well for a few dollars at local cafes, where the absence of an alcohol licence means the focus is entirely on the food.
Here are some places to try.
Three names kept coming up when I asked where to dine in Dubai: Coya, 
 and 
. All three are London exports from restaurateur Arjun Waney. I tried just the first, and this Peruvian restaurant is as good as the original. In fact, the higher ceilings mean it feels less cramped. It's much the same food from chef Sanjay Dwivedi, and there is a cool pisco lounge. Coya is 
. (Zuma is top for Japanese; La Petite Maison for French.) There is a lunch menu at 130 dirhams ($35 at about four dirhams to the dollar) but expect to spend a lot more at night. 
This is an Istanbul-based steakhouse that has a great following in Dubai. (I went to the original once and sat in the naughty corner for fat tourists while the rest of the room was crowded with beautiful people.) I got a table in Dubai by showing up at lunchtime when Nusr-Et (and Coya next door) are relatively quiet. You lose out on atmosphere but do get to try some great food, albeit at high prices. A modest lunch (with water) for one cost 412.5 dirhams plus service. If you are on a budget, this isn't the place for you.
This restaurant from the British restaurateur Jason Atherton is among the most exciting in Dubai. The view is stunning. The menu is filled with original dishes. Tristin Farmer is a talented chef. And the service is first class. I've been to 10 Atherton restaurants around the world, and the originality and distinctiveness of Marina Social is remarkable. But - and this is an enormous but - the place is too dark and too loud. We ordered the 
 at 450 dirhams for four courses, where the kitchen decides what to send out. We struggled to hear descriptions of the dishes (or each other) and to see what was on the plate. We lapsed into a very unsocial silence. (Or maybe I was just boring everyone.)
This is the most charming restaurant I visited. It's outside the city, in a gorgeous botanical garden where the sounds are of rustling leaves and water lapping in fish-filled crystal streams. You can sit in a wooden pavilion dining on light and uncomplicated, mainly Thai, dishes such as saffron shrimp curry. Or come for breakfast, when the options may include poached egg on tapioca and potato hash or vegan tofu scramble, served with bagels and croissants from the bakery. My Arabic breakfast plus cappuccino and water came to 80 dirhams before they knocked off 20 percent because I paid by Amex. I have no idea why, but I recommend it to restaurants everywhere.
I have to thank my colleague for taking me to this family owned Iranian café in Bur Dubai. Although it is difficult to find, the cramped and cluttered venue is well known for the quality of the food and the friendliness of the service. There is a great sense of hospitality and warmth. A large plate of cucumber, tomato and onions is placed in front of you before you look at the menu, where dishes range from about 25 to 40 dirhams.
This bistro in the Vida Hotel serves light and fresh Mediterranean food in a bright and beautiful dining room with attractive views across downtown. The founding chef is ex-La Petite Maison, and it shows in the menu and prices. The food is particularly good, though the bill may give you indigestion: Ours was 934 dirhams (plus service) for two, including wine. A starter of quinoa salad, confit duck legs and clementine was 75 dirhams, while grilled tiger prawns with aji amarillo peppers cost 145 dirhams.
This inexpensive and unfussy restaurant fills with families enjoying superb south Indian food, including savory aappam crepes similar to those for which customers queue for hours at 
 in London. It was Hoppers owner Karam Sethi who directed me to this easy-to-miss café, where one of my best meals in Dubai cost a total of 32 dirhams, including pepper chicken curry, mutton keema aappam, chapattis, yoghurt and water.
You line up at a hatch to order a fish or prawns in a room that lacks air conditioning and other essentials. You line up again to pay. Then you wait half an hour for someone to shout out your name and deposit the food, served on greaseproof paper. You eat with plastic cutlery and enjoy your (soft) drink from a paper cup. That's it. And this meal was my most enjoyable in Dubai. The hammour fish is freshly caught and the seasoning - with garlic, ginger, cumin, chili and coriander powder - spot on. The bill for two, with a large bottle of water, was 135 dirhams.
This is a longstanding favorite for Lebanese cuisine in Dubai. (It was only when I sat down that I realized everyone had recommended Al Nafoorah to me on my previous visit, in 2007.) There's a business lunch at 120 dirhams if you are in a hurry, or you might just order some tabouleh (36 dirhams) and chicken liver with pomegranate (52 euros) or meat from the charcoal grill.
This seafood restaurant over the water at Madinat Jumeirah may be the most romantic in Dubai. You are taken out along the pier in a trishaw and then deposited in a room with views of the Gulf, the coastline and the Burj Al Arab super-luxury hotel. With all that to look at, it's probably best that you don't have too much time to study the prices 
. The shellfish platter for two, for example, is 900 dirhams. Heritage tomato salad costs 80 dirhams. But Pierchic is romantic, and you can't put a price on romance. (Unless you are a divorce lawyer.)
If you like your Indian food refined, Indego is a beautiful restaurant with modern dishes in the Grosvenor House hotel. I've gotten to know chef Vineet Bhatia since my first-ever review was of Rasoi Vineet Bhatia, in London, in 2004. Bhatia was a pioneer in creating and presenting dishes with the kind of precision and aesthetics rarely associated with a cuisine known for robust flavors and family style servings. Indego showcases his contemporary Indian cooking. Try for a table on the terrace.

=== Title: How to Cook Roast Lamb: No-Fail Trick From Pierre Thiam’s Senegal - Bloomberg ===

Pierre Thiam was born and raised in Dakar and came to New York to finish college after the Senegalese government shut down its schools and universities in 1988. Instead, Thiam found a restaurant job and went on to open a Senegalese restaurant in Brooklyn, then write one of the first 
 to explore his country’s cuisine in English. 
In his 
, Thiam reminds us that the food of Senegal is a rich and inexhaustible subject, tracing culinary lines between West Africa and the U.S., and calling attention to dishes inspired by the Vietnamese and Lebanese immigrants who've helped shape the culture. For instance, you’ll find a recipe for 
, the cool, herb-packed summer rolls, tucked between those for jollof rice and fried fish with relish.
The book is part travelogue, moving through the country with joy and authority, from the former French colonial capital up north, to the tropical, southern region of Casamance, where Thiam used to visit his grandparents as a kid, and out to Dakar on the western coast.
Dakar’s casual
are famous for serving meat cooked over coals or kissed with wood-fire smoke. But Thiam’s instructions for making a beautiful dibi-style feast at home are straightforward and don’t involve building a clay oven in your backyard. Instead, you turn the oven dial to 175, sit back, and let that super low heat work its magic on a bone-in leg of lamb.
This really is one of the best things you can do to a leg of lamb. It takes forever (OK, eight hours) but requires very little of your attention and hardly any hands-on work. Meanwhile, the meat is transformed, becoming impossibly tender and ready to feed a crowd.
Thiam’s recipe takes the low-and-slow method a little farther: Before the lamb goes in the oven, it's seasoned generously with garlic and thyme and wrapped up tight, dibi-style, in brown kraft paper, with sliced onions and just a little bit of water. This all steams gently inside the paper, so in addition to meat that's deeply flavored and falling apart, you end up with a wonderfully salty, garlicky juice—perfect for soaking up with a warm, mustard-smeared baguette.
If the packaging has held up at the end of those eight hours or so, and it probably has, you can plop it directly on the table and unwrap it like a gorgeous, meaty gift. And if you really want to do this thing right, make sure there’s a bottle of habanero-powered hot sauce around, too—ideally, Thiam’s version of kani, the spicy Senegalese condiment, spiked with tamarind and fish sauce.

1 or 2 baguettes, for serving
1 tablespoons peanut oil
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
6 plum tomatoes, chopped
1 Scotch bonnet pepper, chopped
1 bay leaf
2 tablespoons tamarind paste
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoons fish sauce
Salt and pepper, to taste
Preheat the oven to 175. Trim some of the excess fat from the lamb, but not all of it, and use a paring knife to cut deep slits into the meat. Stuff the garlic and thyme into the slits. In a bowl, combine the mustard, cumin, salt, pepper, and oil, then rub this mixture all over the outside of the lamb.
Line a baking sheet with a piece of kraft paper that will be large enough to enclose the lamb. Spread the sliced onions in a layer at the center of the paper and place the lamb on top. Carefully pour the water around the leg, then fold the paper tightly around the lamb, enclosing it like a package. Make sure the paper is completely sealed (a piece of butcher twine can help with this).
Roast for 8 hours. The lamb is done when the meat pulls away and is spoon tender. Serve right off the paper with a baguette to mop up the juices and extra mustard and tamarind kani sauce on the side.
Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook the onion and garlic until soft and fragrant. Add the tomatoes, Scotch bonnet, and bay leaf. Simmer for 15 minutes, until thickened (add a little water if the sauce thickens too much or too quickly). Remove from heat and add the tamarind, fish sauce, salt, and pepper. Take out the bay leaf and discard. Purée in a food processor until smooth and store in the fridge for up to 3 weeks.

=== Title: Gourmet Weed Edibles from the Cannabis Kitchen Cookbook: Recipes - Bloomberg ===

Robyn Griggs Lawrence has a steak recipe so good it'll make you feel high. Literally.
Seared Wagyu New York Strip with Cannabis Rub is just one of more than a hundred gourmet-inclined recipes Lawrence compiled for her
now entering a second printing. Now she’s taking her expertise right into readers’ homes with an online cooking course.   
Lawrence, based in Boulder, Colo., is one of many entrepreneurs in the $5.4 billion legal marijuana industry. Unlike pot-repreneurs selling already baked brownies, cookies, and gummies, which may account for 
,
she is teaching consumers how to make the goods at home. Each dish—from Baked Artichoke, Crab, and Cannabis Dip to Cannabis Ceviche and High Ho Pottanesca—features the nation's favorite newly legal ingredient.
Since 
's
release in September, Lawrence has organized cooking demonstrations at hotels, arranged retreats in Colorado, and filmed that four-part online course. The class, called “Cooking with Cannabis: The Fundamentals,” will become available online in April to anybody over 21 years of age through the 
. Lawrence will cover the basics of the who, why, and how regarding cooking with cannabis, with an emphasis on safety and proper dosing. Because the course offers only information, it will be accessible in any state. “We would never suggest or condone using cannabis in states where it isn’t legal,’’ she warned. (Editor's note: Since Bloomberg is based in New York, we haven't personally tested any of the recipes below.)
Lawrence got her start in the legal weed arena in 2009, when a doctor recommended she use marijuana to help with painful cramps, but the sugar-laden edibles sold in dispensaries across the state didn't suit her eating habits.
“It works for a lot of people; that just isn't how I eat,” said Lawrence, who at the time was editor-in-chief of 
 a publication focused on green living. 
Scouring the internet for healthy, delicious, weed-infused recipes left her empty-handed. She found five cookbooks on the subject, but they were filled with unhealthy comfort foods. They were also designed in the style of classic stoner culture. Lawrence wanted a guide to making gourmet, upscale recipes that happens to use the plant.
When her 11-year run with 
came to an end in 2011, she accelerated her work to tackle the problem. As an avowed cooking-show junkie "going back to Julia Child," Lawrence was able to match her professional skills with a lifelong passion. "I’m still green girl, just a different green,” she said, noting past coverage in organic food and organic medicine. "I’ve taken a lot of classes and seen a lot of demos through my work. For me, this is just a natural progression."
That's not to say it has been an easy go. 
Lawrence worked with 12 chefs hailing from California, Colorado, Oregon, and Massachusetts, plus a professional mixologist to develop recipes over the course of three years. Then it took almost two years for a publishing house to bite. In the meantime, the industry (and society) have caught up to her ambition. Barnes & Noble Inc. agreeing to carry cannabis cookbooks came as a major breakthrough, according to Lawrence; the bookseller now has 14 of them listed on its website. 
's glossy hardcover is designed to fit in alongside more typical gourmet cookbooks. That's not to say it shies away from its highlighted ingredient: The cover shows two marijuana leaves on a napkin next to a plate of pasta, and the recipes inside all have pun-filled names that make use of pot-culture slang. Recipes cover everything from breakfast and juices to appetizers, salads, entrees, sides, desserts, and cocktails. Clear step-by-step instructions regarding the plant itself, infusion and extractions, dosing, and tools are covered in depth before the text proceeds to oils, butters, tinctures, and sweet infusions.
It's been a particular hit with baby boomers, Lawrence said. “We thought we were behind, but we were ahead of the curve. I knew it was an important book because I needed it. I figured the world did, too.''
“The whole idea is that you wouldn't need a separate book for entertaining, and if you want it for health that this would be like your one 'mastering-the-art' kind of book,’’ she said. As for the crowded marketplace, “it's definitely more gourmet than the other ones," she said. "Mine's more for the upscale cook.''
For all our readers who are at least 21 years old in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Washington D.C., and for those with medical prescriptions in the 23 states, Washington, and Guam, check out the recipes below.

1⁄4 ounce cured cannabis flowers, finely ground
1⁄4 cup organic extra-virgin olive oil 
coffee grinder
fine mesh strainer
cheesecloth
Place cannabis into a coffee grinder and grind until powdered. The cannabis will stick to the inside of the grinder, so scrape it out thoroughly. (Be careful about licking the spoon; that’s potent goo.) Place oil into a 6-inch diameter shallow frying pan or saucepan. Using a wooden spoon, continuously stir cannabis into the oil over a very low simmer for 10–20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
Line a fine mesh strainer with cheesecloth and place it over a bowl, wide-mouth jar, or measuring cup. Twist cannabis with cheesecloth, squeezing out every last drop of oil. Compost cannabis solids. Use oil immediately or transfer oil to a clean, clear or dark bottle or jar with a lid or cork. Label with the type of oil and date. Store in a cool, dry place for up to a year.
*DISCLAIMER: THC calculations for these recipes were made based on the assumption of 10 percent THC in the plant. That’s used as a standard, but your chances of growing or buying cannabis with 10 percent THC are extremely low. These calculations are for comparison purposes only. The potency of the material you use is the most important indicator as to how a recipe will affect you.

2 cups water
1⁄2 ounce cannabis, finely ground
1⁄2 pound butter
fine mesh strainer
cheesecloth
airtight containers
Combine cannabis and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer for 1 hour. If moisture reduces, add enough water to make 2 cups. Remove from heat, cover, and let cool to room temperature (about 2 hours). Return to stove, add butter to pan, and simmer for about 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
The next morning, return saucepan to stove and bring to simmer. Stir. Remove from flame, cover, and let cool to room temperature. Line a fine mesh strainer with cheesecloth and place over a bowl, wide-mouth jar, or measuring cup. Pour butter through strainer to strain out cannabis. Twist cannabis with cheesecloth, squeezing out every last drop of oil. Compost cannabis solids. Transfer butter into airtight container. Refrigerate overnight. Butter will separate from water. 
The next morning, run a knife around the edges of container to loosen butter. Use knife to remove butter that has separated from water in bottom of container. Line a fine mesh strainer with cheesecloth and strain remaining butter. Place butter in airtight containers, label, and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months, or in the freezer for up to 6 months.

=== Title: Hauser Wirth Schimmel Art Gallery Downtown LA Is America's Largest - Bloomberg ===

“We could have made it bigger,” said art dealer Iwan Wirth, reclining in a midcentury chair on the second floor of his new
new, 116,000-square-foot gallery. “But we don’t want to be [bigger]. These are manageable spaces.”
Manageable, of course, is relative. 
The new 
 takes up an entire city block. The complex—seven buildings that include a former bank, three warehouses, and a five-story building originally used for milling flour—is easily the largest destination in L.A.’s Downtown Arts District, an area that’s 
 for powerful New York galleries’ grand 
.
This is Hauser & Wirth’s sixth location. Iwan Wirth, who co-founded the gallery's original Zurich location with his wife and mother-in-law in 1996, before expanding to London, New York, and Somerset, U.K., has partnered with Paul Schimmel to run the new location. (Schimmel is formerly the chief curator of L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art.) Together they’ve hired a staff of around 25 people to operate the space and filled its galleries with more than 100 artworks for the inaugural exhibition, "Revolution in the Making: Abstract Sculpture by Women," a show devoted to a dizzying melange of striking, often very large, sculptures and installations spread across four of the complex’s ground-floor galleries. There's a series of giant canvas and welded steel wall sculptures by Lee Bontecou, a 12-foot-tall timber installation of Phyllida Barlow's signature multicolored fabric balls, and a giant aluminum floor sculpture by Lynda Benglis.
There's also, it should be added, a bookstore and a 6,000-square-foot interior courtyard. A restaurant, Manuela, is set to open up this summer. 
The inaugural show was designed to make a splash, with works on loan from private collectors and foundations, museums that include the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and MOCA in L.A., and such galleries as Paula Cooper and Michael Rosenfeld. (Although it may sound odd, it's standard procedure for a major gallery show to include, as this one does, many works that aren't for sale.) This being a commercial gallery, though, moneymakers include a bronze painted white-and-blue statue by Louise Bourgeois from 1949 (on sale for $2.4 million), one of Phyllida Barlow's trademark fabric balls from 2014 ($95,000), and a plaster wall sculpture by Anna Maria Maiolino ($180,000). 
Celebrations for the opening are reminiscent of the lengthy rollout of New Coke: There are teaser previews, a series of dinners for friends, families, and collectors, a media preview, and then on Sunday, the public opening will feature 
.
The party is easy enough to arrange (again, relatively speaking)—the colossal opening exhibition (that the party is celebrating) is an entirely different story.
Even the tiniest gallery show on the Upper East Side on Manhattan requires an intense amount of coordination. The organizer needs to find art to sell, art to borrow that accompanies (and ideally, augments) the art for sale, and then, after finding all this art, the organizer needs to negotiate its transport, presentation, and promotion. When you scale up to Hauser Wirth & Schimmel's size, the same logistics exist, but on a massive scale.
Wirth claims it’s a nonissue.
“To do a couple more shows a year isn’t that big of a challenge,” he said, shrugging. “We’re not reinventing the wheel.” 
 
But that’s only part of the story. Hauser Wirth & Schimmel is dramatically scaling down its number of yearly exhibitions, which makes programming easier.
Whereas in New York “five shows a year is the lowest we could possibly do,” said Marc Payot, a partner in the gallery, the L.A. space, he said, will do around two or three. “That New-York centric rhythm wouldn’t work here,” added Wirth. “It would just be a waste of resources.”
 
Hauser Wirth & Schimmel also benefits from the fact that many of its artists actually work in L.A. On a recent tour of the gallery’s private upstairs exhibition spaces, the superstar artist Paul McCarthy (the maker of the famous 
) was overseeing an installation of his paintings and sculpture in a back room.
“To have Paul install this is unbelievable,” said Wirth, shaking his head. “This would never happen outside of L.A.” McCarthy, for his part, said he loves the space. “The building’s pretty incredible,” he said, as a team of four assistants struggled to mount a giant abstract painting behind him. “It’s just a labyrinth of levels.”
So: the gallery has the artists to make the work, the staff to manage it, and the space to show it. And whom, in turn, does Wirth say it’s all for?
L.A. is “a completely different landscape than even five years ago,” he said. Many people didn't buy art, and those who did preferred to fly to New York galleries to make their selections. Now, Wirth says, “the city’s doing well, and there are more local collectors. They’re more mature, in a way, and there’s a growing interest in art from the entertainment industry.” The city's reputation as a money-losing showcase for galleries, in other words, is beginning to change.
“We’re actually here; this isn’t just a project space,” Wirth said. “When you come to L.A., you have to take it seriously.”

=== Title: Doyle Dogs in Art Auction Paintings 2016 - Bloomberg ===

In 1998, 
, the Upper East Side auction house best known for its genteel sales of silver and antique furniture, held an auction devoted solely to Man's Best Friend. It was a success, and for more than a decade the Dogs in Art sale became a yearly tradition.
The last sale took place in 2009 and included sporting art and wildlife art. Consignors and collectors, however, wouldn't let the Dogs in Art sale expire without a fight.
"We always received so many inquiries," said Ariel Gold, a specialist in Doyle's paintings department. "Given that level of interest, we decided to create a new sale." Like a dachshund-shaped phoenix rising from the ashes, the 
 was reborn. 
The popularity of the sale shouldn't come as a surprise. The art market has a 
, in which dogs and horses (and dogs with horses) are recurring themes. The work of George Stubbs (1724–1806), one of Western art history's better-known animal painters, regularly sells for six- and seven-figure sums; in 2014, for instance, his portrait of a spaniel 
 at Sotheby's in London. Henry Edwin Landseer (1802–1873), another notable artist of the animal genre, has a dedicated following. (He made the lions in Trafalgar Square and painted portraits of a number of Queen Victoria's pets.). Landseer's portrait of a dachshund owned by the hereditary prince of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha sold last year for more than 
 at Sotheby's in London.
Next week's sale at Doyle will be more modest. Tucked into a larger, Feb. 9 sale of Belle Epoque decorative arts, the auction comprises 40 dog-themed lots, most paintings. Several, such as the trio of paintings by Louis Darling (1916–1970) offer traditional hunting scenes: 
, 
, and the less lyrical 
. Others, like Frances Mabel Hollams' 
 appear to be commissioned portraits. Then there are paintings by Belgian artist Thierry Poncelet, which seem to exist in a world of their own.
"He began his career as a restorer, and one day he was bored in the studio and decided he wanted to spruce up some Old Master paintings," explained Gold. "So he painted the face of a dog on the head of an Old Master's figure, and then it became a new career for him." Hence 
, a portrait of a Victorian woman whose head happens to be that of a bloodhound.
None of the lots carry estimates higher than $30,000, with most well under $5,000. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the breed depicted in each painting can affect its price.
"We've seen that pugs tend to do quite well," Gold said. "German shepherds are a little more challenging to sell."
Check out a range of lots below
: $1,000–$1,500
 
: $600–$900
 
: $2,000–$3,000

=== Title: The Pig and the Lady: Best Vietnamese in Honolulu - Bloomberg ===

You know about Kona coffee grown on the volcanic slopes of Hawaii’s Big Island and about those impossibly sweet pineapples, but on Saturday mornings in eastern Honolulu, the 
 gets rowdy with people after all sorts of other things.
There are fresh abalone still alive in the shells and spiky deep-water shrimp to eat whole, yakitori-style, hot off the grill. Culinary students from Kapiolani Community College sell suckling pig meat inside buns baked with taro root starch. OnoPops has wands of vanilla ice cream frosted over with passion fruit sorbet and swirls of pureed strawberries and goat cheese sweetened with cane juice. 
But the most densely filled and dedicated line is the one for 
, a Vietnamese food stall operating inside a cloud of grilled chicken smoke and anise-scented steam that rolls off a stock pot in the center of the kitchen. 
“It’s really quiet today because of the rain,” says co-owner Alex Le, as he ladles broth over noodles, though the line hasn’t let up since 7:30 a.m., when the first customer of the day ducked under the tarp and ordered the special, a thoroughly delicious, turmeric-stained brisket curry with carrots and tomatoes.
Chef and co-owner Andrew Le, a 32-year-old first-generation Hawaiian, started the Pig and the Lady as an occasional pop-up back in 2011 and later became a vendor at the city’s farmers markets. Two years ago, Le opened a restaurant in an industrial space in Honolulu’s Chinatown where he gets deeper into Vietnamese cooking, beyond pho and spring rolls, into lesser-known noodle soups from the south of the country, regional dishes from along the Cambodian border, and Chinese-influenced Vietnamese food.
Now Le is at work on the menu for a second restaurant in town, as well as a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines that will involve serving plane-friendly versions of Le’s cooking to first-class passengers next year. On the second floor of Le's Chinatown restaurant, a lab-like kitchen built to teach cooking classes and host other chefs’ popups is nearly ready.  
A hybrid soup-inspired sandwich is partly responsible for Le’s growing fame. To be precise, a sandwich that integrates the flavors of pho into a kind of French dip. This may sound silly until you actually taste it: Le’s sandwich is a crusty baguette stuffed with spiced, cured brisket, cooked so it’s tender and falling apart, with a pile of mung bean sprouts smoked up in a hot wok and a rough paste of Thai basil. It’s delicious just like that, but on the side is a bowl of meaty pho broth with a float of fresh herbs. Dip the sandwich into the broth, and the bread drinks up the liquid, turning dumpling soft. The beef is licked with umami and aromatics. Everything gets exponentially better. 
The Pig and the Lady’s business plans might be ambitious, but the staff is also closely-knit and packed with friends and family. Teri Le, who is married to Andrew, runs the office on the second floor of the restaurant. Alex Le, his older brother, is responsible for the popular traveling kitchen at the farmers markets. Lawrence Ho, who worked in finance in Hong Kong for a decade and is now a partner at the restaurant, met Le when he was a kid growing up in Honolulu. 
“When we were young, we 
 went to Andrew’s house,” says Ho, pulling up a chair outside the office. “Because he had a pool, but mostly because his mom cooked amazing food.” 
Andrew’s mother is Loan Le, known to everyone as Mama Le. She was born in Hanoi, the youngest of 13 children, and later married a man from central Vietnam who worked as an English translator during the Vietnam War. The young couple left as refugees in the 1970s and landed in Hawaii, where Loan taught herself how to cook every single thing she missed from home and quietly dreamed of opening a restaurant.
After culinary school and years in a French kitchen, Andrew Le wanted to start making Vietnamese food seriously, and he turned to Loan for instruction. But he was still experimenting, figuring out how to synthesize all his influences, and he wanted to do 
 stuff, like put bacon and eggs into pho. 
“You’re going to embarrass the Vietnamese community,” Loan warned him when he first pitched her that French dip sandwich idea. “You’re going to shame the family!” The two butted heads over change in the same way that every first generation kid butts heads with his parents, but they loved working together (the company is named after the pair: Andrew's the pig; Loan's the lady). As praise came in from diners, Andrew learned to trust his new ideas, and Loan learned to like them.
A year later, while on a cooking hiatus in Vietnam to visit her family, Loan Le suffered a stroke. By the time the Le family got back home to Honolulu, Loan didn’t have the energy she did before, and she didn’t remember all the things she’d taught Andrew about traditional Vietnamese cooking. 
It was Andrew’s turn to remember—and to teach Loan how to cook again. “We started small,” Andrew explains. You hold an onion. You get used to peeling it. Then you chop it, fry it, add sugar and fish sauce. “Before you know it, you have a dish,” Andrew says, sitting in the restaurant after his shift. Dish by dish, one onion at a time, Andrew brought his mother back toward the classic Vietnamese dishes she loved. Loan now has a folding chair permanently set up in the prep room, for the days when she comes in to check up on the kitchen.
Andrew’s own cooking changed in the meantime. It became more focused and, in some cases, more traditional. “That’s when we started the farmers market stall,” Andrew explains, “And we made all the food my mother cooked for us.” Sure, you can still find the French dip-style sandwich and the bacon-infused pho, and there’s an extravagant bowl of snails coated in bone marrow and fried betel leaves at the restaurant, which you can spread on hot slices of grilled baguette. But alongside these composites are things that Andrew says he won’t touch, such as the Cha Ca La Vong, a famous dish from a Hanoi restaurant by the same name. 
To make it, Andrew marinates catfish with fermented rice paste, turmeric, ginger, and shrimp paste, which stains it a gorgeous neon yellow and lends it a soft edge of sourness. The fish is served with an ostentatious amount of dill and herbs over fresh rice noodles. And it’s delicious like that, the way it’s been eaten for more than a hundred years, the way it’s now served at the Pig and the Lady. 
But you can find it other ways there, too: Andrew stuffs the La Vong-style catfish in a sandwich with local tomatoes and pickles and calls it a Po’ Boy. And he recently piled small pieces of it on fresh, shining betel leaves with noodles to make a tasty little cocktail snack. 
“Sometimes you have to keep it hard-core traditional,” he says. And you know what this means: Rest of the times, you don’t. 
 

=== Title: Abu Dhabi Dining: From Sushi Beside the Sea to Affordable Spiced Lamb - Bloomberg ===

Abu Dhabi is a city with spectacular architecture and beautiful hotels. But let's face it: It's hardly known as a dining destination.
Fortunately, you can eat very well in the capital of the United Arab Emirates: From sushi to camel burgers, there's an international range of food on offer. Rooftop cocktail bars are another attraction. Here are some places to try.
This dramatic restaurant at the 
is
built over the water. It features a beautiful modern dining room with clean lines topped by a jumbo outdoor terrace where you can enjoy the breeze while sipping cocktails and drinking in the view. Best still, there is a generous happy hour with 50 percent off Veuve Clicquot Rose, which takes the bottle price to 297.5 dirhams ($81) - so low it would almost be rude not to order one. 
is pretty good, too, including a starter of galantine of quail, with pistachios and black trumpets, hazelnut mayonnaise, mange tout salad, sultana and truffle vinaigrette (90 dirhams).
Jumeirah at Etihad Towers is also home to Li Beirut, which injects an element of modern gastronomy into Lebanese cuisine. Dishes at this award-winning restaurant include a starter of foie gras kabbah with walnut chutney, almond puree and lemon foam (65 dirhams). Traditional dishes such as shishlik kabab (105 dirhams) are also well prepared. You can sit on an outdoors  terrace overlooking the beach and enjoy the solicitous service.
This small Emirati restaurant is a world away from the posh hotels. It's a tiny place with seating for about 20 at bare tables on which you can deposit bones from dishes such as 
(55 dirhams), spiced lamb with rice. There's an English menu if you ask and you can spot your food being prepared in a small kitchen behind the serving counter.
This award-winning Tuscan restaurant at the St. Regis is known for its espresso lunch at 105 dirhams and its brunch, which starts at 250 dirhams. You can order pizza to go, too. The ingredients and cooking are both of a high standard, but this establishment feels very much like the hotel restaurant it is.  I'd be more likely to go here for a business meal than to relax.
The bar atop the 
 hotel serves decent sushi, and the cocktails are 35 dirhams a pop. The main attraction is the glorious night-time view. Sadly, I missed Ladies Night and had much of the rooftop myself as I arrived early.
If you like more modern Chinese food, Hakkasan may be for you. The standards are as high as ever as the international chain expands without any drop in standards. Once you are inside, you could be anywhere: Fine if you are not interested in Abu Dhabi but it's a long way to come for Hakkasan.
This fish restaurant on the beach was one of my favorite places in Abu Dhabi. You reach it via a marble tunnel under the road from the St. Regis Abu Dhabi. There's even a golf cart in case you find the walk too taxing. (The last time I was in such a posh tunnel was in Pyongyang, but the food wasn't so good.) At Catch, there is beautiful fish and sushi, including spicy tuna (48 dirhams), with scallion, sesame seeds, pickled cucumber kimchee sauce. The business lunch is 160 dirhams.
The Emirates Palace has to be seen to be believed. It is blingcredibly luxurious. If you want to taste such excess without going into debt, Le Café in the lobby is worth a look: You can order a camel burger, topped with 24 carat gold flakes, for 110 dirhams and you know you are in Abu Dhabi.
This place looks like a hotel coffee shop but is better than that. Some of the recipes are from chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten via New York-based 
, which created Market Kitchen. The shrimp meatball pizza with arugula pesto, roasted peppers and Parmesan at 80 dirhams ($21.78) is light and fresh, and even better with a glass of Penfolds 2013 Chardonnay at 60 Dirhams. The two-course lunch menu is 75 dirhams, while 
 costs from 250 dirhams to 45o dirhams, depending on whether you are drinking mocktails or Champagne.
For shoppers at the ritzy 
, Bentley is a European bistro with an outdoor terrace. I ordered an intriguing bottle of wine: Boschendal 1685, Chardonnay - Pinot Noir, Stellenbosch, at 300 dirhams. If you are intrigued to see the color, you may be disappointed. The waiter explained that wines on the terrace must be served in black glasses. Oh well.
This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Abu Dhabi, with multiple awards. Take a table outside, order the delicately made dim sum and it is a treat. The illustrated menus and the décor underline just how traditional Shang Palace is, so don't go here in search of culinary adventure.

=== Title: The Best Fried Chicken in New York - Bloomberg ===

I wasn't raised in a religious household, but I went to high school in Atlanta, where eating at 
 was a serious ritual. That's where I went before class on Friday—and sometimes after class on Friday—to eat chicken and biscuits (and chicken 
 biscuits). 
The Atlanta-based chain, founded in the 1940s, has nearly 2,000 locations across the country, including a new Midtown Manhattan location that will open this summer. Let's be honest, it isn't by any means the 
 fried chicken. It holds some power over me all the same, like a first love. I will always think back fondly on those days when I catch the perfume of artificial butter.
When 
 over the weekend, he noted Chick-fil-A as one of several fast-food reference points for his next project. Chang plans to transform the former 
 restaurant space in Manhattan's East Village into the first outpost of 
, a fried chicken test run for what he plans to expand into a chain.
This is exciting news. Momofuku's fried chicken record is already pretty good. (The one at midtown's 
 is a favorite of mine; it includes almost the entire bird—neck and all for nibbling—and a lot of heat from habanero peppers, if you order correctly).
Still, there's plenty of competition in town.
The hot chicken at 
 in Brooklyn's Bed-Stuy is excellent, dusted with enough chili powder to make your lips swell (and to make your nostrils burn if you accidentally inhale it, which happens). But it's sweet enough to keep you coming back for more.
In the East Village,
's fried chicken is brined in sweet tea before it's pressure fried. The result is balanced, not sugary, and it's just right in a sandwich with sliced pickles.
A cook once pointed me toward 
 in Harlem, and I remain grateful. He told me that owner Charles Gabriel might be asleep in a chair when I arrived and said that if I got lucky, the chicken would be fried to order in a wide cast-iron pan. Both things turned out to be true. 
The Thai-style chicken at 
 is a great way to kick off dinner: thighs marinated in red curry paste, covered in garlic, and fried perfectly golden. Though if you're in the mood for American-style fried chicken with glasses of cold Champagne (a perfect pairing), the gorgeous skillet-fried chicken at 
 is just the thing.
I'm drawn over and over again to 
's fried chicken in Carroll Gardens, which is mysteriously, almost aggressively crunchy on the outside, then extremely tender and juicy in the center—with a side of fried pickles.
But the 
, the best of the best, the very best fried chicken in New York? The one against which all others must be measured?
It's the one served at 
, a grimy dive in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, at which the tables are sticky, the music loud, and the fried chicken unbelievable, even if you're sober. Although why not pair it with a Perfect Manhattan? (And yes, it really is perfect.) 
Stephen Tanner, formerly of 
, is in the kitchen. He sends the meat out extraordinarily hot, perfectly seasoned, with so many delicate layers of crisp that it makes a mess. It's consistently awesome (and so are the tender little biscuits with honey butter that come alongside it). If you haven't had this chicken yet, it's the one to seek out.
How will Fuku stand up against all these birds? The opening date hasn't been announced just yet, but I can't wait to find out. 

=== Title: Brooklyn Real Estate Listings Fit for a Coffee Table Book - Bloomberg ===

Most coffee-table books are aspirational, which is reasonable—people want to see the 
, not the McDonalds, of Venice. But that means the vast majority of these books have a “just kill me” element: Someone out there has the time to arrange a 
 with “esoteric ephemera from a life well lived” (and then dust it regularly), but that someone is probably not you or anyone you know.
Finally though, Rizzoli has come out with a coffee-table book with a more attainable standard of living.
, written by Kathleen Hackett and filled with photographs by Matthew Williams, is a tour through apartments and houses in virtually every neighborhood of New York’s most design-forward borough. Yes, they have the predictable sun-drenched, funky-yet-elegant, modern-yet-classic aesthetics that make you want to weep—this is still a coffee-table book from Rizzoli, after all—but unlike an “effortlessly elegant,” 400-year-old riad in Morocco or a private-island retreat off the coast of a country you’ve never heard of, these are places in which you, dear reader, can actually live.
Don’t believe us? We’ve taken a few of the apartments featured in 
 and found comparable real estate listings that (in theory) you could move into tomorrow. (The 
, you’ll have to figure out on your own.)
 
This single-family home, located on what we’re told is a “handsome tree-lined street,” is actually owned by the book’s author, who lives there with her husband and two children.  A similar 
 is currently listed in the same neighborhood for $4.3 million. It has four bedrooms and two bathrooms spread across four floors, and potential owners will enjoy the marble fireplaces, a giant backyard, and, presumably, like-minded neighbors: The listing also describes its location as being on a “charming, tree-lined street.” 
 
The book describes this “classic six” (real estate jargon for “apartment with six rooms”) in a prewar apartment building in Brooklyn Heights as “atmospheric, serene, and meticulous.” The same could be said of a nearby $5.495 million, 
, also located in a prewar building in Brooklyn Heights. The listing has wood-burning fireplaces, a custom Balthaup kitchen, and four bedrooms along with another room that the listing calls a “library/den,” which is inevitably a polite way of saying “guest bedroom.”  
 
When the owner of this sprawling Dumbo loft moved to the neighborhood, she was quoted as saying that “there was nothing ... but deserted warehouses.” (Her building was a former toilet-seat factory, the book tells us.) Today, the only deserted things in Dumbo are half-finished construction sites and apartments like this 
. The listing in question has three bedrooms and two and a half baths spread across 2,992 square feet of living space, which features wall-to-wall windows and 13.6-foot high ceilings. It doesn’t quite have the same gritty patina as the Dumbo of yore, but on the plus side, the apartment comes with a soaking tub.  
 
The three-story brownstone detailed in the book has a lovely combination of original detail and a pared-down aesthetic. Its owners, Italian transplants, reportedly spurn decorations that are “expensive—or serious,” but that hasn’t stopped them from constructing a kitchen worthy of a coffee-table book. A slightly more polished 
—this one has been broken up into two 2-story units—is currently on sale for $2.795 million. Prospective owners can easily recreate the book’s aesthetic, though: Add two preschool-age children, and the floors will look lovingly scuffed in no time. 
 
For reasons that remain unclear, the owner of this Bushwick railroad apartment confesses, in print, to stealing police barricades “in the deepest part of Brooklyn” to use as construction material for his apartment. (“I get a lot of parking tickets,” he says, as if this implies causality.) Whoever buys this $950,000 
 will presumably have no need for construction material, bought or stolen; the 1,370-square-foot apartment, which includes a large private garden, was recently renovated. 
If this 700-square-foot apartment looks a little too good to be true, it’s probably because it’s the home of the co-founders of Workstead, a Brooklyn design studio that’s done the public spaces in the Wythe Hotel in Brooklyn and the Arcade Bakery in TriBeCa. Another 
 (this one is located on a brownstone’s upper floor) is roughly the same size and on sale for $1.115 million. The apartment has wide plank floors, a built-in cocktail bar, and, a private terrace patio up top. Like the book’s apartment, it also has a design pedigree: Its recent renovation was featured in 
magazine.

=== Title: The World's Next Big Wine Regions - Bloomberg ===

I’ve always been a wine-discovery junkie, constantly on the hunt for new grapes, new vintages, new winemakers, and especially new places where vines may never have been planted before. Thanks to ambitious vintners, rising demand from drinkers, a taste shift to lighter wine styles, and yes, even climate change, the number of global hot spots for wine is ever expanding. If you’re still rattling off the names of the old, long-famous regions, you’re way behind the times. 
As Eastern Europe's class act for wine, the historic Tokaj region is getting a €330 million (&374 million) investment over the next five years to upgrade its vineyards and bolster its reputation. (Under communism, quantity was prized over quality.) Its 5,500 hectares of vineyards, at an 800-foot elevation on volcanic slopes, are devoted primarily to three native white grapes. They include hard-to-pronounce Hárslevelü and flagship furmint, which is the key varietal in the luscious sweet wines associated with the region. The latest craze, though, is a newly available dry version of furmint, Hungary’s alternative to chardonnay and riesling. 
2011 Istvan Szepsy Betsek Furmint ($75). Smoky, citrusy, rich, and complex, it reminds me of a great Alsace riesling.  
Thomas Jefferson grew grapes in the state but failed to make great wines. Still, the modern era (starting in the 1970s) has drawn more than 240 determined vintners, including Donald Trump and AOL co-founder Steve Case. In 2014, they sold a total of half a million cases and seem now to be at the tipping point. Of the eight whites (chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, riesling, and several more), the most promising is viognier, but the best wines so far are the Bordeaux-style red blends made from cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, merlot, and petit verdot. A couple of top examples wowed even Eric Boissenot, consultant to Bordeaux’s first growths. 
2010 RdV Vineyards Lost Mountain ($95). This complex, spicy, rich, and velvety cabernet/merlot blend rivals a French 
. 
When you think of an Aussie wine, you may envision a blockbuster shiraz, but the most interesting bottles I tasted on a recent visit to Australia were pinot noirs from this cool, green valley an hour’s drive northeast of Melbourne. Though the area’s 100-plus wineries make only 4 percent of Australia’s wine, this spot is a hotbed of young ambitious winemakers. They’re mainly chasing great pinot noir and chardonnay, the region’s most planted grapes, but on the radar are a lighter style shiraz they label syrah, sauvignon blanc, and even nebbiolo. 
2012 Mac Forbes Yarra Valley Pinot Noir ($40). Forbes’s widely available basic pinot is silky and savory, with tastes of spice and succulent red fruit. 
This is the land of qvervi, the pot-bellied clay amphora lined with beeswax and buried in the earth that vintners have traditionally used for fermenting juice from nearly 500 indigenous varieties of grapes. The method and the country’s 8,000-year-old winemaking history have given its reds and whites countercultural appeal. The current wine revival was helped along by a seven-year Russian embargo that forced producers to improve and export. Among the 15 most important varietals, one red (saperavi) and two whites (rkatsiteli, mstvane) have the most global potential. 
 2010 Pheasant’s Tears Kakheti Valley Rkatsiteli ($18). Golden amber in color, it’s round, ripe, and fleshy, with notes of apricot and spice. 
Forget England’s famously damp, chilly anti-wine-grape climate. Global warming and the same chalky soil as France’s Champagne region make its south coast a natural for sparkling wine—66 percent of the 4.5 million bottles produced here are bubbly. As in Champagne, chardonnay and pinot noir are the most planted grapes. Nearly 150 wineries are betting on the future, and so far, I’ve found the best wines come from the South Downs of Sussex. 
2010 Ridgeview Grosvenor Blanc de Blancs Brut ($40) is zippy, lemony, and creamy—a fine aperitif. 
 
An hour and a half east of Napa Valley, zero-glamour Lodi has a long history of growing and selling grapes to outsiders. Only recently has it fostered its own wineries; now there are about 80. Land is cheap, so wine prices are low. This is red wine country and California’s zinfandel capital, providing grapes for about a third of the state’s premium zins. Vintners here craft some of the boldest examples around. But the adventurous ones are experimenting with some 70 varieties, including Spain’s tempranillo, Portugal’s touriga nacional, and Italy’s barbera and primitivo., 
2012 L’ Uvaggio di Giacomo Primitivo ($14). This juicy bargain has layers of spice and berry flavors, and is surprisingly complex for the price. 
The 45-degree slopes of a massive, perpetually rumbling volcano in eastern Sicily don’t automatically make me think of vineyards, but in the past decade Mt. Etna has become one of Italy’s most exciting wine regions. Thirty years ago there were five producers; now there are nearly 90 who tend vines at elevations of 2,000 to 3,500 feet. Native grapes carricante for whites and nerello cappuccio (and the even better nerello mascalese) for reds produce the best wines. The high altitude and rocky terroir translate into sultry, salty, highly distinctive wines. 
2011 Tenuta delle Terre Etna Rosso Santo Spirito ($40) is all stony earth and silky sour cherry flavors. 
This long, narrow country, with some 13 wine regions, has recently planted vineyards in extreme locations: at altitudes of nearly 7,000 feet in the Andes and in the middle of the Atacama desert. But I’m a fan of the little-known Maule region, in the south of the Central Valley, where small-scale vintners discovered a treasure trove of old carignan and pais vines. Though the majority of Maule’s 36 million liters of wine (in 2013) are Chile’s mainstays, cabernet and sauvignon blanc, these old vines offer something truly special. 
 2011 Garcia + Schwaderer Carignan Vigno ($50) This smoky, spicy, suave red is ideal for a winter night.

=== Title: Slip-Ons Grow Up - Bloomberg ===

Spring downtime calls for light, casual shoes that can handle the various new occasions that come with the warmer months. Our suggestion? Slipping in to something more comfortable and carefree, like a pair of slip-on sneakers. The right pair is affordable, versatile, and easy to dress up when the dress code permits (you know, for that mid-May outdoor wedding). 
If you're feeling adventurous, opt for a bold graphic pattern. Add extra interest with a textured suede or canvas. But whatever you do, 
 wear socks. If shoes rub your feet the wrong way, pick up a

=== Title: Edible Weed May Be Half of the $5.4 Billion Pot Business - Bloomberg ===

Peggy Noonan knows a thing or two about marijuana. She was a drug runner between Mexico and the U.S., before earning her living as a dealer in Arizona. Both stints ended badly, with Noonan serving time in a Mexican jail and slapped with federal probation in Arizona. All that feels like ancient history, says Noonan, who’s among the thousands of “ganjapreneurs” in the burgeoning market for edible marijuana products. “It was pretty wild, life coming full circle,” she says.
Noonan’s Cornucopia Health and Wellness in Tucson sells 40 products including Weedish Fish gummies, extra-large German chocolate brownies, and Serenity Tincture—all infused with varying degrees of pot—to about 60 so-called dispensaries in Arizona for medicinal use. The company, which opened for business in April 2014, employs eight people and has seen sales double over the past three months, says Noonan, who’s not to be confused with the columnist and Ronald Reagan speechwriter of the same name.
Marijuana is legal for adult recreational use in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and the District of Columbia and for medical purposes in 23 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam. U.S. sales of legal cannabis reached $5.4 billion in 2015, up from $4.6 billion the year before, according to ArcView Market Research. Edibles and other infused products—defined as anything other than the bud itself—make up at least half of the total, dispensary owners say.
“It’s probably the most exciting segment of the marijuana industry,” says Christian Hageseth, founder and chairman of American Cannabis Partners, a holding company for marijuana-related businesses. “We still haven’t identified who’s going to be the Apple computers or the McDonald’s hamburger or the Coca-Cola” of edibles.
Many people have heard of rapper Snoop Dogg’s Leafs brand of pot edibles, but there are scores of companies popping up across the country, with names like Dixie Elixirs, Incredibles, and BlueKudu, adding new items to the marijuana menu. Keef Cola, a soft-drink line owned by CanCore Concepts, is expanding this year from Colorado to Oregon and Nevada, according to the brand’s co-founder Erik Knutson. Its Colorado licensee, Denver Packaging, sells Keef Cola in more than 380 dispensaries and turned a profit last year.
Despite the recent momentum on legalization, the industry faces plenty of hurdles, not the least of which is convincing lawmakers and the public that edible marijuana products are safe. One concern is the obvious appeal of pot-infused candies, cookies, and soda pop to children.
In the past couple of years, several states have taken action, some spurred by reports of an increase in emergency-room admissions. Most require marijuana edibles to be sold in child-resistant packaging that’s opaque, so the contents aren’t visible, and free of cartoons or other images that may appeal to children. The American Association of Poison Control Centers fielded 352 calls in 2013 and 456 in 2014 about accidental exposure to THC, the psychoactive chemical compound in marijuana, in children under 12. In 2014, by contrast, there were 17,563 reports of children ingesting deodorants and 28,009 incidents involving diaper cream.
Noonan , who grew up in an affluent family on Central Park West in Manhattan, began smuggling marijuana into the U.S. from Mexico after graduating from Arizona State University in the late ’60s. The weed was supplied by “farmers coming down the mountains on donkeys with bales,” she recalls. “It wasn’t any kind of syndicate. It wasn’t like cartels.”
Noonan was arrested in 1969 and spent three months in a Mexican jail. After serving her time, she returned to the U.S. and started dealing. The feds caught up with her in 1975. Noonan’s ex-husband was sent to prison for two and a half years while Noonan, pregnant at the time, got probation.
After her marriage broke up, she moved back to New York, worked as a drug counselor, then enrolled at Parsons School of Design. She started her own company as a designer, developer, and contractor in the high-end residential market. She relocated the business to Tucson in the late 1990s, changing its focus to restaurants, and began laying the groundwork for Cornucopia after Arizona legalized medical marijuana in November 2010.
The edibles are baked at a commercial kitchen, part of a 13,000-square-foot “grow” site where Noonan cultivates and harvests marijuana. “We are constantly tasting,” she says, explaining that the company first makes uninfused versions of its products for sampling. Once she’s satisfied with each batch, her two-person sales staff loads the goods into unmarked vans (to avoid attention) and delivers them to dispensaries across the state. What Cornucopia bills as “The World’s Best Brownie” can fetch as much as $12.50 retail. It contains 40 milligrams of THC. Globe Farmacy, an Arizona dispensary that sells the brownie, recommends customers start with 10-milligram increments.
Noonan has ambitions to expand to California, Colorado, and Washington state dispensaries through licensing agreements to comply with state laws. “Going national is ultimately the goal,” she says. In the meantime, she’s using Facebook and Instagram to bring attention to her brand and collect customer feedback. “We like that, getting comments, even if it’s negative. It all helps.”

=== Title: Champagne’s Greatest Innovators Have a Bar Named for Them, Finally - Bloomberg ===

Champagne wasn’t always such big business. Barbe-Nicole Clicquot Ponsardin was just 27 when she became a widow and took over her husband’s struggling wine company, now 
. In the early 19th century, she went on to lead the biggest disruption in the history of Champagne technology. The young entrepreneur developed what's now known as 
, or riddling, in which bottles are stored at an angle and periodically turned so that dead yeast gathers in the bottleneck and can be taken out efficiently. The process has become standard (often mechanized), but it was a major innovation at the time. Before Clicquot Ponsardin mastered it, many Champagne makers couldn’t guarantee that their sweet bubbles would sparkle crystal-clear. The future of the industry was uncertain.
Clicquot Ponsardin’s deep understanding of the wine changed the game, and she played a role in establishing Champagne as a luxury product with an international market. If you love to drink the stuff, it’s hard to read 
, written by Tilar Mazzeo, without feeling a little bit grateful. (After 1810, a very good year, she was the first in the industry to market vintage Champagne.)
Riddling Widow, a tiny subterranean bar that opened recently in Manhattan's West Village, is named not only for Clicquot Ponsardin but for the many French businesswomen who expanded family companies after their husbands died: Louise Pommery took over the house in 1860 and was the first Champagne maker to launch dry, brut Champagne; Mathilde Emile Laurent Perrier took over in 1887; Camille Olry Roederer in 1932; and Lily Bollinger in 1941. They helped make Champagne what it is, cleverly marketing it as luxurious, celebratory, chic. Still, it's important to remember that you don't really need an excuse to drink it.
The bar is one of those owned by Ravi DeRossi, owner of 
, and it differs from many of the opulent Champagne-themed bars that have preceded it in New York. After you reach Riddling Widow by way of a narrow staircase, the tiny room has the worn-out, dreamlike look of a 
 set piece: a compact, extremely low-ceilinged red lodge with a velvet chaise longue and simple counter seating. Don’t expect oysters. DeRossi, a vegetarian, is currently in the process of making all his bars and restaurants 
, including this one. You’ll find veggie chips and a garlicky dip, a giant bowl of spicy popcorn, warm toasted pepitas, and at least for now, some cheese. All this tempers the fanciness of any Champagne associations while tiding you over until a late dinner. Better yet, the place is open until 2 a.m. (except on Sundays, when it’s closed), which makes it perfectly suited for a nightcap, especially if your idea of a nightcap is a cold glass of creamy bubbles.
The music is not reliably good, but the drinking is. Tanner Walle, formerly of Terroir, put together the wine list and will crouch nearby to tell you about his favorites with great enthusiasm. Whether you want a super dry 
 from California, or something rich and yeasty and classic from Épernay, there are over a dozen sparkling wines by the glass (starting at $10) and over 30 by the bottle (starting at $40), from refreshing Basque Txakolina and flowery-nosed 
 Champagne, along with some beers and still wines.
The monster commercial houses aren’t represented, but you can drink their products anywhere. Trying a glass of something new is what Madame Clicquot Ponsardin would have wanted.

=== Title: Five Great Swim Trunks for Men That You Can Also Wear as Shorts - Bloomberg ===

The enjoyment of summertime pursuits is dependent on multiple things coming together at once; the right location, weather, and company can all make or break a weekend spent under the sun. (Allegra and sunscreen help, too.) 
But sartorially speaking, probably the greatest factor that will assure your memories are happy ones is your choice of swimwear. Get it wrong, and you’re miserable and uncomfortable—both physically and mentally. So let’s get it right. Here are the rules, men:
Here are five options to get you started, and hopefully to inspire your annual swimwear upgrade.  
Because you're less likely to be 
 who makes a cannonball entrance into the corporate splash zone if you're wearing something civilized, such as this pair of gingham swim trunks by 
. And the bright orange, suede driving shoes by 
 also say, "I like to party, but I keep it classy."
You're not breaking any dress codes by taking the top half of this lightweight, almost seersucker cotton suit by 
 and pairing the unstructured blazer with this well-cut, kitschy, seaweed-print swim shorts by 
. In fact, you're elevating the rules. 
For drinking. Perhaps during the day, as summer Fridays call for. Because anyone who can conquer copious amount of rum-in-the-sun can brave this straight-leg, Liberty-print swim trunk by 
. Just add a pair of bold shades, such as this pair by 
—and don't forget to take two Advil before bed. 
It's time to hit the 
 with whatever dog-eared book of the moment you're reading. So get comfortable. This double-face crewneck sweatshirt by 
 will do the trick, even after your sunset dip in the bay. As will these flexible-waistband striped swim trunks by 
. 
Everyone knows that the grill master (that's you) is a true patriot. Thus you've been known to wear some red-white-and-blue in your time, as with this knit by 
and the "rescue" red 
 
 shorter-length swim trunks. Wear these, and you'll be ready to heat things up. 
 

=== Title: Nine Best Dopp Kits to Travel With - Bloomberg ===

You can learn a lot about someone by seeing what’s in their dopp kit. (Beware: It's kind of rude to ask.) The kit is not only the home of all of your pills, grooming tools, and potions, but how you keep it organized can explain what kind of traveler you are. Do you have handy travel-sized versions of only the essentials? Then you're a planner, and you're efficient. Are you carting around half a dozen semi-empty body wash bottles and stringy mending kits you cadged from hotels? You fly by the seat of your pants, and you're always ready to improvise. And what about the dopp kit itself? Is it a handsome, clean tote, or a beat-up bag you've been lugging around for more than a decade?
(That was a trick question. It should always be attractive and neat.)
Below, we've gathered nine great options for different types of travelers, from those who like traditional sturdy canvas kits to those who like lots of compartments and organizational tools. Select wisely. 
M.R.K.T is known for using socially conscious materials and vegan leather on all their products. This water-resistant felt body dopp kit includes waterproof internal compartmentsm for those who worry about spills or leaks from various liquid products. ($75, 
If you're both a frequent flyer and a neatness freak, the F1 spacepak toiletry bag is the one for you. The super-lightweight bag, which weighs only 12 ounces, includes two roomy mesh zip pockets, in addition to a flat zip-pocket attachment that's perfect for smaller items. And don't be put off by the vivid orange color; he bright interior allows you to locate small items a whole lot quicker. ($42, 
)
Durability is key when it comes to the perfect dopp kit. Choose one made out of canvas if you want it to last. This item from J.W. Hulmes Co. is guaranteed for a lifetime. ($275, 
)
If you're a frequent guest in the course of your jetsetting (if hosts are going to see your dopp kit in their guest bathrooms), consider one that will impress with its luxuriousness, such as this navy, woven, leather one by Bottega Veneta. ($820, 
)
Leave it to Tumi to design a three-zipper, unfolding dopp kit in Tumi's FXT ballistic nylon, for those who care about function as much as durability. ($95, 
) 
Valextra is known for exceptional hand-crafted leather accessories. If you appreciate craftsmanship and quality leather, this one is screaming your name. (It does not have internal dividers, but it is spacious.) ($880, 
)
Camouflage patterning has been popular for a few seasons, and here's a fresh way to use the trend. The camo waxwear dopp kit pairs printed cotton with a useful waterproofing treatment that only gets better with age. ($168, 
)
Pack light and stay organized with this option from DSPTCH. Although it may look small, it's made to fit all the travel essentials for any getaway trip. ($62, 
)
If you're super-anal when it come to packing, the type to color-coordinate your grooming products and travel essentials, then look no further. The hanging dopp kit from Moore & Giles offers more than enough compartments and both snap and zip pockets to keep your liquids separated and help you avoid unfortunate spills,. And keep you well-organized. ($325, 
)

=== Title: Cannabis Coffee Makers Are Hoping to Become Bulletproof 2.0 - Bloomberg ===

It was during an endless drive home from a camping trip in eastern Washington that entrepreneur Adam Stites came up with his latest product. "What would happen if I infused heavy cream with cannabis, then mixed it with my coffee?" he mused. (“My VW van doesn’t go very fast, so I have a lot of time to think,” Stites explains.)
He road-tested the idea as soon as he got home. So strong was the first dose, Stites woke up 13 hours after he chugged a single cup. Nonetheless, his professional interest was piqued. Not long after, he set up 
 to sell a commercial version of his creation: marijuana-infused cold-brew coffee, dosed up with 20 milligrams of THC per serving. Waggishly named “Legal,” it’s the ultimate wake and bake.
“Our customers are not looking to get blown out of their mind, just ever so slightly tilt their relativity,” Stites says, employing the lyricism of a man who clearly started his day with a cup of Legal. “It’s great for a Sunday morning, where I’m at a teahouse reading the newspaper and want to focus and get some work done,” he tells us from a conference in Las Vegas.
It required a complex process for Stites to develop his signature product. Binding the weed and beans into a functional joint venture was a major hurdle. Coffee and cannabis molecules separate when brewed because cannabis oil is not water-soluble; much of Mirth Provisions’ intellectual property rests in the unique way it uses plant-based emulsifiers to keep the oil evenly suspended in water.
Moreover, Stites had to find the ideal cannabis strain to complement coffee in both flavor and effect. Cannabis contains two crucial components: THC, the psychoactive element most closely associated with feeling high, and CBD, which has no hallucinogenic impact and usually leads to alertness. The two major species of marijuana, sativa and indica, contain varying proportions of THC and CBD. Stites spent months trying to find the ideal ratio of each, testing 50 different strains before narrowing his final choices. Legal's range includes plain coffee, coffee with sugar and milk, and even fruit drinks, each juiced with its own herb recipe.
Weed adds a rich, earthy base to the flavor, he explains, while Legal’s mixture of THC and CBD confers a calm sense of focus on caffeine’s jittery high. Caffeine is absorbed almost instantly by the body, but it takes from 45 minutes to 90 minutes for the human body to process the weed so it can prolong the caffeine high, Stites says. 
The potential profits from a mashup of coffee and caffeine are, well, high. Per IRI data from Bloomberg Intelligence, coffee sales in America totaled $9.4 billion in the 52 weeks ending Nov. 1; it’s harder to gauge the size of the pot industry nationwide, but most estimates put it around $3 billion annually. Legal coffee has racked up 
 since it launched in September 2014, all but $6,737 of which came in during the current calendar year.
Given these numbers, Stites isn’t alone in creating canna-coffee, drinkable riffs on a spliff. Elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest, Vancouver (Wash.)-based 
produces Catapult, its own Mary Jane joe by applying oil to whole coffee beans before grinding and stabilizing the mixture. Intended as a home-brew alternative, Catapult is handily packaged in pellets that fit any Keurig-like machine. The company sold around 2,000 units last month, and owner James Hull estimates that sales are increasing by 15 percent month-over-month. Both these figures are for a single state (Washington), but it’s easy to extrapolate the enormous potential market as the legalization of cannabis spreads. The same issue was debated on Nov. 16 at a 
.
In California, where marijuana is legal for medical purposes, Jill Amen’s Bay Area-based 
 also offers a house-baked coffee. Amen uses special filters in prepackaged sachets that allow the weed molecules to pass freely into the brewed liquid. She also offers various strength levels—up to 200mg in a single serving (plus a creamer containing 20mg per dose, if you dare).
“It blows my mind. I would never have guessed, but there are quite a few patients in a huge amount of pain, or who at least have an extraordinarily high tolerance,” she says by phone. (Amen is also in Las Vegas, at one of the 
 many new confabs, 
.) Another California company offers little more than a token toke: LA’s 
 uses ‘herb conditioned’ Ethiopian Yirgacheffe beans. Owner and roastmaster Kian Abedini 
 “hot-boxing the roasting room”: Beans are exposed to vaporized marijuana when still green and unroasted. This means that the remaining residue is insufficient for drinkers to get high.
The rush of canna-coffees isn’t driven solely by the potential of its dual market, according to Jordan Michelman, co-founder of 
, a Portland-based online coffee magazine. The Washington native suggests cultural factors play a role, too.
“In the Pacific Northwest, there’s this slang term for a Northwest Speed Ball, which is a shot of espresso and a puff of marijuana, and people have been doing that for quite some time,” he says.
Stateside, as Michelman points out, both café- and counter-cultures emerged simultaneously and in the same place: Beatniks and hippies have been drinking espresso and smoking joints in the Pacific Northwest since the 1960s. Since marijuana was legalized, coffee-roasters have been able to capitalize on that association legally, creating Speed Ball-inspired products such as Legal coffee. (Michelman calls Legal the "best tasting” of all the weed-infused brews he’s tried.) It doesn’t hurt that canna-coffees are high-margin, novelty gimmicks for dispensaries to use in luring curious newcomers, much as vaporizers probably did when first launched.
All this raises some of the safety questions inspired by vaporizers, especially the issue of gateway products. A study, published in the 
 by a team from a branch of the National Institutes of Health, explored the impact of a caffeine-like drug on lab monkeys; 
 suggested that doses of such a chemical tended to lead to higher intakes of weed. Combining the two, it seems, could be risky, at least according to Gary Wenk, an Ohio State neuroscience professor and author of 
. 
“Coffee enhances marijuana’s addictive properties,” Wenk explains by e-mail. Since it turbocharges marijuana’s euphoria in that way, Wenk continues, coffee spiked with weed could lead to dependence on the latter. “If [drugs] share some molecular mechanisms, their effects might become additive, or even synergistic. That’s why it’s never a good idea to combine psychoactive drugs.  The effects can be hard to predict.”   
The biggest challenge for this budding industry, though, is that current laws bar consumption on premises, Amsterdam-style, in coffee shops. Legal and its ilk must be brewed—and consumed—at home.
Stites is primed for those rules to change, saying that Legal’s emulsification process could be adapted for serving at a conventional café. Weed-infused coffee could easily be made fresh, on-demand, in the same way European-style 
 is charged with a slug of grappa. Just picture a tiny drop of concentrated hash oil on top of that foam. (And amazing latte art, we're sure.) Once that’s permitted, Sprudge’s Jordan Michelman expects most major Pacific Northwest-based coffee companies to launch their own herb blends.
“You won’t just see one brand doing it. You’ll see a rush into that market,” says Michelman. Look for the Starbakes signs on Pike Place soon.  

=== Title: China's Slump Casts a Pall on Dealers of Asian Art - Bloomberg ===

On March 10, the exhibition "Ancient Chinese Jade: From the Neolithic to the Han" will open at 
 on 57th Street to coincide with New York’s 2016 
. James Lally, the gallery’s owner, says he has already presold half of the 75 jade objects that make up the show. The pieces range from $5,000 to $500,000, but “the $500,000 pieces are the ones that went first,” he said.
Yet despite that initial success, Lally has a fairly bearish outlook for Asia Week, a 10-day event during which 45 dealers and multiple auction houses throw an Asian-art selling bonanza. “I think we’ve already seen a moderation in activity on the international market for Chinese art,” he said. “The buyers are not as euphoric as they were five years ago.”
That absence of euphoria has a lot to do with the fortunes of mainland Chinese collectors, who in recent years fueled unprecedented growth in the Asian art market. “In the past 25 years I’ve had my gallery, if we had 10 active collectors of what I was selling in New York, we were busy,” said Eric Zetterquist, whose 
 specializes in Asian ceramics. “There are probably 10,000 collectors in the field in China.”
As the Chinese economy 
, many of those buyers have pulled back dramatically—not from the top of the market, which includes many of the jades Lally sold—but from the middle market, where objects sell for around $20,000 to around $90,000.
“In a difficult economy—which we can all admit we’re in—who are the people who are most affected?” asked 
, the chairman of Asia Week New York. “The people who have fewer resources."
That’s a relative term—these are still small, collectible objects that sell for more than a Mercedes—but the middle-market slump is unmistakable.
“Normally what sells is not selling now,” said Suneet Kapoor, whose Upper East Side 
 specializes in Indian and Himalayan art. He estimated that his business is down 20 percent to 30 percent in the Asian market. “I’ve heard from dealers in mainland China and Hong Kong who’ve mentioned that they haven’t done business in three months,” he said.
This is in stark contrast with the last few years, when the middle market skyrocketed. Now it's coming back to earth.
“Take the example of a porcelain 
 vase that in perfect condition would sell for $150,000 to $250,000,” said Mason. “Now imagine that vase has a serious crack: In a buoyant, frothy market, even with the crack it might make over $100,000; now, in an economy where there are fewer buyers and there’s the sentiment that the market is retrenching, instead of making $100,000, it’s going to sell for half that amount,” he said.
Mason couches this development in positive terms: “I think the other way of saying this is that the speculative aspects of the market have dampened,” he said.
Kapoor, who said most of his gallery’s business is in the middle market, is less sanguine. “It’s affected us across all areas of our specialities—not just Chinese art, but Indian, Himalayan, Gandharan, and Indian works, too,” he said.
Kapoor isn’t simply stepping back to ride things out; he’s actively engaging with Chinese collectors via social media and 
 and expects a large number of Chinese visitors during Asia Week, when his gallery will open the exhibition "Amrita: Nectar of Immortality," a show featuring Indian miniatures, large 
, and Hindu and Buddhist sculpture, all of which range from $15,000 to more than $300,000.
Chinese buyers are “still a staple,” he said. “You do hope for them to visit, because they still have such buying power.”

=== Title: How Is the Art Market Really Doing? - Bloomberg ===

If you’ve been paying attention to auction coverage recently, the outlook seems grim: The value of artworks on offer 
, volume and totals are down significantly, and various news organizations (
) have sounded ominous warnings of an imminent market decline.
But all of this is drawn from a tiny sliver of the art market. Bloomberg’s auction coverage, for instance, is largely confined to 
, 
, and 
. Not only does that exclude tens of thousands of smaller auction houses around the globe, it also omits the majority of art buyers. Only 
 on the planet can afford to spend a million dollars on a painting, but many millions have paintings in their houses. (It’s also worth pointing out that even millionaires often 
 by buying art at galleries and through private sales.) We have no idea, in other words, how strong or weak the market really is.
That’s beginning to change, though, thanks to an online auction service that many people—even art-world insiders—have never heard of. 
, which was founded in 1989 as the database company Artfact and then repurposed into its current form in 2009, is in essence an online portal: Collectors search for, say, 
, and the site will display upcoming lots from more than 4,000 brick-and-mortar and online auction houses, most of which fall within the low to middle end (lots below $100,000) of the market. Users can then bid on these lots through Invaluable’s site; the company makes its money by charging the auction house a transaction fee (about 5 percent) when an online bidder buys an object.
Because it represents so many auction houses, Invaluable has compiled a vast database of past art sales, perhaps the largest of its kind in the world. (Other databases, such as 
, have robust data in contemporary and modern art categories but are less comprehensive in others.)
Private collectors, companies, and institutions can pay a fee to access Invaluable’s database; the company says that, along with some of the world’s biggest dealers and galleries, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Louvre in Paris, and even the IRS subscribe to its services. “Auction houses, too,” Invaluable’s chief executive officer, Rob Weisberg, said in an interview. “We make it available to them so that they can be better appraisers.”
Until now, however, Invaluable hadn’t released any aggregate data, which meant it was sitting on a lockbox of analytics and market insight. After some prodding, the company has agreed to pry it open, but only just.
In 2014, according to Invaluable, the 1,400 auction houses it represents that sell fine art (a category that includes paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, photography, and posters) had a total of $607.9 million dollars in sales. Last year that number grew to $681.8 million, or a 12 percent increase. Drilling down a more esoteric category, we can look at the year-over-year growth for Asian art and antiquities: In 2014 the total was $237.3 million; the next year sales increased 17 percent, to $276.6 million.
Again, this is a limited snapshot. Invaluable declined to release the number of objects in its totals, which means, conceivably, that the 12 percent growth could have been derived from a single, multimillion-dollar sale. The company also declined to release the sales data from previous years, which means the 2014-15 year-over-year growth could be an anomaly.
Still, the data is useful; even though these numbers pale in comparison with the 
 totals at Christie’s and Sotheby’s, this is some of the first information to come out of heretofore overlooked auction houses. (Now is a good time to mention that other market reports already exist, like the one released by the 
, though its research is 
 exhaustive.) 
Invaluable’s totals are helpful enough, said Marion Maneker, editor of 
, to make some (careful and caveat-riddled) extrapolations. “We’re seeing a thriving market for lower-placed works,” he said. “Participation is going up, and dollar amounts are going down.”
Put another way, Invaluable’s data appear to demonstrate that there’s been a trickle-down effect: The massive, headline-drawing sales seem to have convinced buyers that art is an investment worth making.
“We saw a run from 2010 to 2015 that was primarily in the so-called masterpiece market,” said Maneker, referring to works roughly above $10 million. “That’s running out of steam now, but it’s given enough time for the middle market to build itself up with plenty of participants who have plenty of confidence.”
This could be heartening news to many dealers and auction houses. The market has profound growth potential if the thousands of people who spend $1 million are supplanted by millions who spend $1,000. At the moment, it appears that’s exactly what’s happening.

=== Title: Daniel Boulud Lobster Roll Recipe: Three Easy Types - Bloomberg ===

Nailing the appetizers is key to a successful cocktail party. (Well, that and booze—such as this 
 recipe from our 2015 Holiday Entertaining Guide.)
As part of our 
, Michelin-starred chef 
, shares an easy way to wow your guests: lobster salad, three ways. 
Boulud banks on the bites' “wonderful array of taste, texture, and color” (thanks to carrot, radish, and fennel in the classic base recipe), amped up with Vadouvan curry and smoked paprika, or simply served, classic lobster roll-style, on a mini hot dog bun. The fact that you can make it ahead of time as well, then sit back and enjoy the party, makes this the perfect festive nibble.
Note: Don't be intimidated at the prospect of boiling a live lobster. It's easy! But if you're pressed for time, pre-packaged lobster meat (or even chunk crab) can work.  
 
1 small carrot, coarsely grated
½ small fennel bulb, trimmed and coarsely grated
6 pink radishes, trimmed and coarsely grated
1 4-inch piece daikon radish, peeled and coarsely grated
½ cup mayonnaise
3 cornichons, chopped
1 tablespoon small capers, rinsed, dried and chopped
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 ½ teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 ½ teaspoons flat-leaf parsley, chopped
1 ½ teaspoons chives, chopped
1 ½ teaspoons tarragon leaves, chopped
6 drops Tabasco
Salt and freshly ground pepper
12 ounces cooked lobster meat (about 3 1½-pound lobsters), cut into ½-inch chunks
Squeeze the grated carrot, fennel, and radishes between your hands to remove any excess liquid, then transfer to a large bowl. Add all the ingredients except for the lobster meat and mix well to combine, then toss in the lobster and stir until coated. Finish using any of the four methods below.
 
Gently brush the sides of store-bought mini hot dog buns with melted butter, and toast in a sauté pan set over medium heat. Fill each roll with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the lobster salad and garnish with chopped flat-leaf parsley and sliced radish.
Mix 1 teaspoon of yellow curry spice, such as Vadouvan, to every 2 cups of the lobster salad, stir well to incorporate, and let the salad marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.  Cut 3 sheets of store-bought pappadom into 6 small squares each, and fry in 350⁰ oil until golden and crispy (approximately 40 seconds). Transfer directly to a paper towel-lined tray and season with a salt. Top each piece with 1 tablespoon of the curried lobster salad and garnish with finely grated carrot.
Mix 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika into 2 cups of the lobster salad and stir well to incorporate. Cutting on a bias, slice a fresh baguette into 12 pieces about ½ an inch thick each. Brush with softened butter and toast in a 350⁰F oven for about 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Remove and let cool for at least 15 minutes. Top each piece of baguette with 1 tablespoon of the smoked-paprika spiced lobster salad and garnish with an extra pinch of paprika.
 

=== Title: World Trade Center PATH Station 360 Video Photos - Bloomberg ===

 
 
Downtown Manhattan got a 
 on Thursday.  
Was it worth it? Well, that's a more complicated story. Architect Santiago Calatrava’s World Trade Center Transportation Hub opened with an afternoon ceremony to a trickle of commuters and a flood of controversy. (“
a “
” that “
” have been some of the harsher critiques.) The distinctive structure with wing-like ribs connects the PATH commuter trains from New Jersey to the New York subway system, as well as the trans-Hudson ferries. 
“It’s a building that’s generated a lot of strong opinions,” said Sam Cochran, features editor of 
, in an interview. “For people in the architecture world, the chorus has always been to reserve judgment. Would this be like Penn Station, a source of 
? Or would this be like Grand Central, a source of daily inspiration?”
When he visited the hub’s hall, which Calatrava has dubbed its Oculus, Cochran was pleasantly surprised. “Having seen the building, I think it’s going to be the latter,” he said.
Cochran's prediction seemed to bear out on the hub’s first day, when multiple visitors heaped praise on its interior.
“It’s very uplifting to see it finished,” said Andre Hurni, a retired architect, as he stood in the main hall. “I think it’s very successful, a grand entry to come here from New Jersey, to walk up the steps and see this space.” 
Whatever your opinion of the hub’s soaring, skeletal architecture, you can't deny that this level of public attention for a commuter rail station/shopping mall is unprecedented.
Part of the scrutiny derives from its location on the corner of the the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. An additional source of intrigue is the 12-year-long project’s cost, which started at $2.2 billion before ballooning to the title of "most expensive train station, ever." (For context, the nearby, 104-story 1 World Trade Center is the tallest building in Manhattan, took seven years to build, and cost $100 million less than the hub did.)
“It’s a huge improvement over what was here before,” said Doug Burke, a retired court reporter who was visiting the hub on its first day. “But it sure ain’t worth 4 billion bucks.”
The building’s 50,000 daily commuters will soon have the chance to decide for themselves. Everyone else can check out the building with Bloomberg’s 360-degree video

=== Title: Booker and Dax BDX Cocktail Cube - Bloomberg ===

Big ice isn’t just to impress you. The reason bartenders use single, oversize cubes at cocktail bars is because in addition to chilling the mix, a larger cube bouncing around a cocktail shaker can actually transform the texture of the drink, aerating the liquid, resulting in a drink that looks and tastes a little bit better.
At first, Dave Arnold, the owner of Manhattan cocktail bar 
 wasn’t so sure, but after running a slew of boozy tests, Arnold discovered that it wasn’t the ice, but rather the 
 of the cube that did the work. He realized that this meant you, the person going through a lot of trouble to get big ice cubes, could actually use a bag of bodega ice, a tray of small cubes from your home freezer, or whatever garbage ice you had handy to chill the drink, as long as you had something, 
, the size and shape of a big ice cube in your shaker, too. (Science!)
Arnold is the same person who brought us the 
, an attachment that turns a blowtorch into a powerful, even broiler by spreading the flame through layers of wire mesh. So of course he quickly devised an affordable big-ice hack: The 
 ($20) is a 2-inch food-safe, high-density, polyurethane cube that you can dump into your shaker along with 
 kind of ice for a consistently better cocktail.
His core market may be cocktail bars that spend about $1 a pop making big ice (one reason your cocktails cost what they do), but it’s even more suited to home-bar geeks. Try it out in an egg-white drink, just as Arnold suggests, like a pisco sour or a clover club. The super-creamy cap of tiny bubbles could make you a believer, too.

=== Title: 365 S. Mission Road, the Best Art Gallery in Los Angeles Right Now - Bloomberg ===

Drive through an industrial lot, past a few factories, and over a stretch of railroad tracks, and you'll come to a 12,000-square-foot warehouse that contains what might be the most interesting gallery in Los Angeles right now. 
At 
—just east across the L.A. River from the Arts District near Downtown—is a collaboration between the powerful New York gallerist 
, Laura Owens (a painter who's represented by Brown), and Wendy Yao (the founder of the art bookstore 
, which has an outpost in the front of the building). It functions as an informal community clubhouse, event space, and locus for dynamic exhibitions of artists young and old. 
While many L.A. galleries have the feel of a typical New York gallery—cold and open, with one or two gallery assistants who ignore you when you come in—356 S. Mission is warm and informal. There's coffee and tea set out as refreshments, a giant communal dining table for people to sit down at and hang out, and a staff who's happy to sit around and shoot the breeze. It could never exist in New York, not just because of its size, but also because it feels so totally relaxed.
The building started as a printing press in 1926, then became a piano storage facility with hundreds of baby grands stacked floor to ceiling (and run, as it happens, by Liberace's manager). Owens turned the building into a studio in 2012, and after several months she used her own art to stage the space's first exhibition in 2013. Since then, there have been 26 shows, including one that featured the work of Elaine Sturtevant, and another of Alex Katz's 
. 
The commercial gallery (as in: the art you see is art you can buy) currently has two solo exhibitions on view: one by 
, a 356 S. Mission artist in residence, and one by the experimental musician and artist Ben Vida. 
The Fischer show, which occupies a small second-floor loft, is superb. Fischer's artworks—geometric and colorful collages, ceramic assemblages, and textiles—are installed in a quasi-residential setting. Vitrines filled with scrap-like pieces of ceramic are set around the room, and colorful, tightly arranged abstract collages are mounted on the walls. There's even a bed, table lamp, couches, and chairs. Her art is purely decorative, but unlike much of the colorful abstraction currently flooding New York galleries, Fischer's installation is considered surprising and deftly executed.
What truly sets 356 S. Mission Road apart from most L.A. galleries (and really, most galleries anywhere) is its extracurricular programming. 
There are a few gallery clusters in L.A., but like almost everything else in the city, to see the best shows you'll have to drive (sometimes for hours, depending on the time of day). Along with making you weigh your carbon footprint against your art appreciation, it means that visitors rarely just stumble onto a gallery or museum. Whatever you go to had better be worth it. 
Last year, 
 played piano for an informal crowd of admirers; the other week the artist Renee Green screened a film, which was followed by a reading by the poet and critic 
. Three weeks ago the gallery hosted a "coloring event," whereby the artist Eric Wesley, whose show closed last week, led a color-by-numbers seminar in which children and adults made their own versions of a stained-glass window he'd installed. (The window is a cross-section of a burrito.) For a while, there was even a weekly event called Scrabble Sundays, which is exactly what it sounds like.
In a world where market pressures are omnipresent, and the artists on view are as often admired for their prices as they are their actual art, the laid-back, community atmosphere of 356 S. Mission Road comes as something of a balm. It's backed by one of the most powerful dealers in the world, true, but its programming, exhibitions, and ethos are strikingly, perhaps troublingly, unique. 

=== Title: The Next Hot Ingredient in Cocktails: Cannabis - Bloomberg ===

Alcohol has been my drug of choice since my very first White Russian. From guilty pleasure drinks to perfectly crisp martinis, something about the ritual of making and sipping a cocktail had me sold early on. 
I never gave marijuana much love, and even in college, I always chose watery beer over those fat, clumsy joints. But now that bartenders across the country are experimenting with weed-spiked cocktails, I’m paying attention—as should you. The “Julia Child of Weed” has already been anointed, and I believe it’s only a matter of time before we discover the “Charles H. Baker of Marijuana.”  
As a growing number of states take steps to legalize and decriminalize marijuana, bartenders and bud-tenders are coming together, much the way chefs have begun experimenting with high-end, gourmet edibles spiked with THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the potent part of the herb). Mixologists are trying out two kinds of potables: cocktails spiked with THC (where legal), and cocktails designed to mimic the actual green, skunky flavors of marijuana.  
Compared to edibles, for which oil- or butter-based extractions are favored, tinctures (herbal essences that are extracted by alcohol) are the preferred vehicle for drinks. Bartenders use Everclear or a different high-proof alcohol to draw THC from the plant, a process similar to that used to make bitters. The most popular seems to involve grinding and then baking the bud at a low temperature (a process called “decarboxylation”) before steeping it in alcohol for a stretch that can range from hours to days. The liquid is then strained and stored, often in a container with an eyedropper or dasher attachment. (I’m coining the term “cannabitters” here and now.)  
A standard infusion of liquor is an alternative: You merely soak a bunch of weed in a bottle. Those who have experience with making edibles and potables warn that this can create an overly potent drink; tinctures can be used with more precision. If hard alcohol isn’t your thing, there’s always gentler infused wine such as 
 or a soon-to-come offering from singer-songwriter 
. There’s also weed-spiked beer. (After all, hops and cannabis are related.)
Don’t go running to the nearest bar to order a cannabis cocktail just yet. Even in states where recreational marijuana is legal (Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington), public consumption is usually prohibited, which precludes weed-y gatherings in bars or restaurants. Cutting-edge experimentation takes place at private events and in the smoky underground.
The gold standard for high-end cannabis cocktails may have been set in 2012, at 
. The restaurant’s underground weed dinner included THC-infused riffs on the Gin Sour (gin, lemon, sugar, egg whites, and grapefruit bitters, plus a tincture made with gin, Earl Grey tea leaves, and a “grapefruit-y” strain of indica cannabis) and the California Painkiller (rum, fresh-squeezed orange juice, pineapple, and marijuana-infused coconut oil, topped with grated nutmeg; see recipe below). 
These aren’t just drinks with weed dumped in; these are thoughtful cocktails composed to emphasize (or, where it made more sense, deemphasize) the flavors and aromas of the specific strains of marijuana used.
“I remember thinking, this opens a new door into cocktails,” recalls Mike Stankovich, who created the drinks for the event and is now bar manager at Brooklyn’s Alameda. “No one ever talks about it, but you go out to drink cocktails to 
something, whether you call it relaxing or loosening up. In terms of recreational benefits, you’re opening the window a little bit more.” Stankovich doesn’t serve the cocktails now, but he liked the Painkiller drink so much that he offers a faux version at Alameda, made with shiso instead of cannibis.
Of course, not everyone is a fan of the idea of mixing alcohol and marijuana. Adding a weed tincture to a high-octane drink such as an Old Fashioned is “not the most responsible way to consume either alcohol or cannabis,” insists Jane West, owner of Edible Events, a cannabis events production company based in Denver, Colo.
Scott E. Lukas, Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry (pharmacology) at Harvard Medical School, agrees, and he has done considerable research about the combined effects of alcohol and marijuana to back his opinion. 
“People are not good at recognizing when the effects of the two drugs are combined,” he notes. “They’ll slow you down, impair your decision-making, and alcohol tends to make you take more risks.” Lukas is particularly concerned about people who might try to drive after sipping a THC-infused libation. His research has shown that THC can impair perceptions of time and distance as long as 24 hours after consumption, even if the “acute” high has long faded.
A further concern: Binge drinkers might not notice the protective reflex to purge due to overindulgence, since THC can help combat nausea and vomiting. (This is one reason it is often prescribed to cancer patients). “People do die from drinking too much alcohol,” Lukas adds.
That said, highballs (such as a gin and tonic, or a Jack and ginger) could be an ideal delivery mechanism for conveying cannabis tinctures, says West: a little bit of alcohol, a lot of mixer, and just enough THC-tinged tincture to catch a buzz. Noted.
“I think there will be an entirely different way to consume intoxicating beverages in 10 years,” West muses. In other words, imagine a world in which “intoxicate” has a completely different meaning, incorporating the effects of THC, with or without booze. “I think alcohol companies will get wind of this and create low alcohol [THC-infused] products that taste like a whiskey or bourbon.” 
It may be time to place bets on who will capitalize first and best on the nascent and potentially lucrative marijuana boom. After all, the U.S. market for legal cannabis grew 74 percent in 2014, to $2.7 billion, up from $1.5 billion in 2013, according to ArcView Group, a cannabis industry investment and research firm based in Oakland, Calif. This makes it one of the fastest-growing industries in the U.S. Already there are rumblings that reality TV star and Skinnygirl booze entrepreneur Bethenny Frankel is getting into the branded marijuana game. Might liquor conglomerates be close behind?
Stankovich thinks so:  “Flash forward 30 years from now. You’re going to have Stoli Weed.” 
It might not yet be on Stolichnaya’s radar, but a smaller company, Chicago-based Earth Mama, has already launched a "marijuana-inspired" vodka infused with “herbs and botanicals.” They sent a bottle my way so I could conduct an experiment: comparing a flight of martinis made with vodka, dry vermouth, and bitters. (Yes, I know a proper martini is made with gin; stay with me.) The goal of this project was to see how the drinks compared in terms of taste and aroma, as well as overall experience.
Here’s how the results stacked up:
Tastes like: Drinking a martini–crisp, clean, and bracing, with a pleasant whiff of orange from the bitters.
Feels like: Drinking a martini. And I’m ready for the next round!
Tastes like: Drinking a martini, but laced with hints of cedar and dried oregano.
Feels like:  Drinking a martini. Although I wish this one had gin.
 aka a tincture made with THC and orange peel
Tastes like: A poorly made martini. The tincture throws the drink off balance, so I mostly taste bitterness from the orange peel. At least, I think it’s from the orange peel. If I was served this martini at a bar, I’d order a shot of bourbon instead.
Feels like: Nap time.
As cocktail trends go, I found this one to be a bit of a snooze, literally. Keep passing that vape, but as far as I'm concerned, ice-cold gin still should be the strongest ingredient in my martini.

=== Title: Phillips Auction Faced Its Biggest Test in Years—and Passed With $66.9 Million - Bloomberg ===

Phillips’s push to strengthen its brand under its new chief executive officer passed an important test as the auction house’s hybrid sale of 20th century and contemporary art tallied $66.9 million.
The sale on Sunday in New York cleared its low estimate of $64.4 million, and was a 28.7 percent increase over the same event last year. 
’s 5-foot-tall abstract painting with swirling white, yellow and red brushstrokes was the most expensive, fetching $11.4 million, just above its low estimate of $10 million. Of the 51 lots offered, 82 percent sold.
November’s Impressionist, modern, postwar and contemporary sales are among the biggest of the year for the major auction houses, and the season, which started last week and continues this week, is seen as a major test since the financial market rout in August and September. The sale was also important for 
, the CEO appointed last year, who is trying to boost profit by balancing tightly edited categories of 20th and 21st century art and collectibles.
“It wasn’t a sale where you would jump up and down, but it was a solid sale,” said collector 
 as he left the auction. “It puts them in an interesting position with stronger pieces and better price points.”
The top five lots each carried a guarantee and duly sold, though not one surpassed its high estimate. A 1932 painting by 
, who is better known for his architecture, sold for $4.7 million, just above its low estimate of $4 million. The work, an abstract figure that looks derivative of 
, had been in the same collection since it was acquired directly from the artist. 
“Gladiateurs au Repos” by the surrealist artist Giorgio de Chirico depicting a group of muscled mostly nude men standing in various states of repose also had never been to auction. Estimated at $4 million to $6 million, the work, dating from 1928 to 1929, sold for just under $4 million.
Another top lot carried a more varied provenance: 
’s floor sculpture from 1941 had eight separate owners, though it only went up for auction once, when it sold at Christie’s New York in 2000 for $908,000. Carrying an estimate of $3.5 million to $4.5 million, the sculpture fell within its estimate, selling for slightly less than $4 million.
“Broadly speaking the sale was a success,” Dolman said. “The market is discerning. We’re happy with the progression we’re making.”
Sunday’s sale and last week’s $629.1 million tally of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby’s is a sign the art market is showing resilience as volatility continues in the financial markets. Dealers and advisers said collectors are opting for the safety of blue chip artists over those who are younger and less established. Christie’s, for instance, is offering a $100 million 
 nude painting on Monday night.
“It’s a deep market," said the dealer 
. “The positive energy of last week will continue into this week."
This season auction houses 
 not only for trophy artworks but also for the best positions to highlight them. The result was a shakeup in a schedule that for years was tightly coordinated. Phillips’s evening sale, usually slotted after 
 and 
, was moved to Sunday evening in an effort to gain some early momentum, a move Dolman said he was pleased with, although it riled some attendees.
“Having an auction on a Sunday is kind of a confusing choice,” said 
, a London-based dealer who bought a work by 
 for $2.4 million. When asked about the overall sale, he gave a one-word answer: “Weak.”
Phillips, the underdog owned by Russian luxury retailer the Mercury Group, has been employing 
 to assert itself -- it 
 prominent members of the art world including Matt Carey-Williams, formerly a director of sales at 
 gallery, and added a range of 20th century art into its evening sales along with postwar and contemporary art. In an effort to woo consignors, Phillips guaranteed close to 50 percent of its sale.
Despite those safeguards, there were a few disappointments. A dark, heavily worked canvas by the Japanese artist Kazuo Shiraga, who painted with his feet, failed to find a bidder; it was estimated at $2 million to $3 million. The painting was one of three by Japanese artists that failed to sell. Similarly, a 9-foot tall painting by 
 was estimated at $800,000 to $1.2 million. The work, which had cotton and linen children’s dresses embedded into the paint, also went unsold.

=== Title: The New Penn Station Doesn’t Have to Be Pretty - Bloomberg ===

The first week in January, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo unveiled a $3 billion plan for a new Penn Station—the fifth such proposal in the past 25 years. “Let’s be as bold and ambitious as our forefathers,” Cuomo said in his announcement. The renderings were anything but an homage to past visions of grandeur. Although a 1999 scheme featured a hall with a two-floor concourse, two levels of additional tracks, and a spectacular steel-and-glass canopy, this one, with low-slung skylights, resembled the atrium at the Short Hills mall. The plans had more detractors than drunk Rangers fans taking the A train home after a game upstairs at Madison Square Garden. “Penn Station’s 5th Redesign Fails to Charm Some Critics,” read a 
 headline. That was about the kindest sentiment expressed.
It would be a gross understatement to say the current Penn Station also fails to charm. It sees 600,000 subway, commuter, and intercity customers a day, three times what it was built to serve. A dirty, dark, crowded underground warren, it’s a shadow of the original grand neoclassical structure designed by McKim, Mead & White in 1910 and torn down in 1963 when not enough people thought it was worth saving: We were all going to be getting around like the Jetsons soon enough. (Oops.) There was almost-instant regret: The demolition fueled the formation of the NYC Landmark Preservation Commission, which saved Grand Central Terminal from the same fate.
Cuomo’s plan is, to use an architectural term, “meh.” It’s no better than all right. That’s not necessarily a bad thing—maybe this one will get built. (Helping those prospects, there’s more space than in past blueprints for retail, which developers would have rights to.) What it lacks in aesthetics, it might make up for by, you know, actually existing, a trade-off most New Yorkers—and anyone going through Penn Station on Amtrak—would accept. “Meh” design happens. Why did we expect city government to have great taste all of a sudden? How often does that happen?
Yes, in theory, we should be able to define good architecture as both ambitious and buildable, but it seems you have to choose one in New York City. Just look downtown to the transportation hub rising at the World Trade Center site. Its centerpiece—a striking, bone-white oculus by Spanish starchitect Santiago Calatrava—has been plagued by setbacks, including construction delays and a water leak. Twelve years after the Port Authority presented the design, it still isn’t finished, and its budget has ballooned from $2.2 billion to $3.7 billion—twice the inflation-adjusted cost of erecting Grand Central.
This doesn’t mean cities shouldn’t try to build for eternity. But conjuring vast amounts of money and political will for ambitious municipal projects takes time and patience, and one could argue that 25 years is a long enough wait. Denver waited only—only!—10 years for the gorgeous redesign of its Union Station depot by Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill, the architects behind the new Penn Station layout. California is eight years along in the likely 20-year process of building a high-speed rail line between San Francisco and Los Angeles. But what’s eight years? Talk to us when you’ve been through multiple commanders-in-chief.
It’s one thing for leaders to see what can be done and another to see what has to be done—and do it. Cuomo’s father, former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, is the one who said you campaign in poetry and govern in prose. The latest Penn Station renderings are decidedly prosaic, but we don’t care about poetry when we’re stuck on an Acela arriving from Washington and train traffic is preventing us from making a meeting in Midtown. Which is why, last fall, Cuomo and GOP presidential candidate and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie revived discussions about the Gateway project, an essential rail tunnel under the Hudson River that would relieve congestion. There’s nothing sexy about it—and good thing.

=== Title: What Every Wine Geek Needs to Know, Right Now - Bloomberg ===

Listen up: Do you know what these phrases mean: “Pet-nat,” “concrete eggs,” “en rama,” “koshu,” or “red blotch”? You’re not up to speed with the latest trends if you don’t. These terms tip off changes in the ever-more-evolving wine world that affect what you’re drinking. 
Fortunately, they also happen to be among the 350 new entries in the just-published 4
 edition of the weighty, authoritative, indispensable 
, so it’s easy to catch up.  
First published in 1994 and last revised in 2006, the book keeps pace with the times. The new must-have edition packs 978,609 words and more than 4,000 entries into 912 pages. It weighs 6.2 pounds, so forget reading it in bed. 
Over lunch at Gramercy Tavern, accompanied by glasses of savory 2012 Kiralyudvar Furmint Sec ($20 at retail), OCW editor Jancis Robinson filled me in on how she and her co-editor Julia Harding, both Masters of Wine, backed up by some 200 experts, updated this sumo wrestler of a reference guide.  
Their guiding question: What new trends, regions, grapes, winemaking methods, and more would people want to look up? 
Such as ‘petillant naturel,’ the lightly fizzy, often cloudy bubbly 
.  Currently beloved by hipster sommeliers, it’s a return to a old-fashioned way of making sparkling wine. My current favorite is Agnes & Rene Mosse Moussamoussettes Rosé ($20). 
The popularity of this low-fi winemaking is one example of the recent mainstreaming of "natural wine." The term, barely used in 2006, gets an entry.
“There’s been a massive change in the style of wine that people seek,” explained Robinson. “Very ripe, high-alcohol wines are out. Winemakers are looking to tradition—returning to their grandparents’ methods—and moving away from aging wine in new oak.” (Wake up, barrel-addicted California winemakers!) Bordeaux’s Chateau Pontet-Canet, like a growing number of estates, has replaced some cooperage with "concrete eggs" (look under "concrete"). Producers who use these egg-shaped concrete tanks for fermention and ageing instead of oak barrels say it results in wines that have fresher, fruitier aromas and rich textures without the harsh overlay of oak. 
Current curiosity about native grape varieties that people hadn’t heard of a decade ago inspired the inclusion of Japan’s koshu (try delicate white Grace Kayagatake Koshu, $25) and Santorini’s red mavrotragano (try Domaine Sigalas, $30), while "sauvignon gris" has become newly fashionable. An example I tried last week: subtle, complex 2014 Les Arums de Chateau Lagrange ($20). The white blend from Bordeaux now includes 20 percent sauvignon gris. 
New wine spots you’ll be hearing about include Nova Scotia, a source of quality ice wines, and, thanks to climate change and milder winters, Sweden (yes, really) with about 350 wine growers. Most are hobbyists producing tiny amounts of grapes. But about three dozen commercialize their wines (the best are the whites) at winery restaurants or through Sweden’s government-owned chain of liquor stores. 
The latest exciting trend of the sherry revival is "en rama," or crisp, superfresh, unfiltered raw sherries bottled straight from the cask. A top example: Lustau Fino en Rama from El Puerto de Santa Maria ($20), first released two years ago. 
Even the language people use to describe a wine’s taste is shifting. The OCW has added a tart, highly entertaining entry on "minerality." A now ubiquitous buzzword used by critics and sommeliers, it implies quality and refers to flavors that remind wine lovers of chalk, slate, and wet rocks. 
One depressing contemporary issue reflected in the massive tome is the rise in wine crimes. Robinson and Harding included "counterfeit wine," "authentication," "provenance," and "vandalism" for the first time. One of the latest examples in the news: In September, thieves stole €40,000 worth of grapes from Maison Etienne Guigal in the Rhone Valley, which go into a fabulous rare white dessert wine called Luminescence ($125).
Wine apps are another recent wine-world addition (look under "apps, wine"). Though there are now hundreds you can download onto your tablet or smartphone, and more will be coming, most I’ve tried are useless. Among the most popular are free tasting note databases, such as label reader Delectable, one of my favorites. Scan a label at a wine store or restaurant and get information, price, and reviews and rate it yourself. 
You may not be as interested as I am in red blotch (a recently identified vine virus that’s playing havoc with the ripening of grapes in California vineyards), but given the state’s ferocious wild fires this year, you may want to check out new entry "smoke taint," which includes the latest research on how it affects a wine’s taste. 
The 21
 century urban winery movement also gets recognition, and hundreds are now in cities across the U.S., including New York. Berkeley, Calif., is the pioneering hotbed, with several vintners, including Edmunds St. John (Bone-Jolly Gamay Noir, $22) and Broc Cellars (Valdiguié, $25), making delicious wine.
The OCW is such a comprehensive compendium of what’s au courant in the wine world that I found myself wondering why wine crowdfunding wasn’t among the new terms.
Turning to such sites as Seedrs.com and Indiegogo.com is how many wineries are beginning to raise cash. In August, eccentric California vintner Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon offered wacky perks to those who contributed a total of $171,470 on Indiegogo.com for Popelouchum, his project to breed 10,000 new grape varieties. The wackiest: a 650-pound spacecraft sculpture designed to look like his Le Cigare Volant wine logo. 
If the trend lasts, I’m guessing this term will make it into the next edition (or maybe even the online version that will make its debut on www.jancisrobinson.com later this fall). Meanwhile, just about everything else you want to know about wine is right here.

 have their pick of produce: fresh herbs and aromatic spices, seasonal fruit and vegetables, luxury seafood and the finest meats. But if they had to pick one favorite ingredient for their cooking, what would it be? We asked dozens around the world for their favorites, and here’s what they had to say.
 (
, New York): Anchovies. “In cooking, it helps to pull out and layer flavors in a way that makes a dish moreish. You get an abundance of umami.”
 (
, San Sebastian, Spain): Parsley. “I need it like I need air to breathe. I use it in almost all the plates. It is a very Basque ingredient, part of our identity.”
 (Le Moût , Taichung, Taiwan): Fermented bean curd paste. “It is savory, sweet and spicy, powerfully fused with the aged fragrance.”
 (
, London): Vinegar. “I put vinegar of some description on pretty much everything. Getting the balance of acidity right transforms dishes.”
 (
, Franschhoek, South Africa): African sour fig. “The seeds are encased in a salty and sour gel. For me, it’s the umami of South Africa.”
 (
, London): Lemons. “They’re lovely at this time of year. You can squeeze them on fish or make a sorbet. I just made a peach Bellini with them.”
 (
, New York): Cucumbers. “I have a dish on the menu that is five different kinds. You can do them in many ways: ferment them, brine, pickle, smoke, raw...”
 (
, London): Garlic and rosemary. “Garlic brings everything to life, so long as you don’t use too much, and I adore rosemary. It’s beautifully aromatic.”
 (
, Paris): Potatoes. “They are so versatile. I love mash, French fries, gratin dauphinois, gnocchi, pommes boulangère, tortilla...”
 (
, Corsham, England): Butter. “It makes everything taste better. Butter and salt are the two ingredients you can’t do without.”
 (
, London): Salt. “The difference between a good dish and a bad dish is a pinch of salt.”
 (
, London): Chilies. “I am actually addicted. I add them to pretty much anything. But they’re proven to give you a bit of a lift, so it’s all good.”
 (
, Bray, England): Smoked water. “It’s a really great way of getting consistent smoked flavors into recipes, instead of smoking individual ingredients.”
 (
, Washington, D.C.): Eggs. “They are the most versatile ingredient. So many techniques, dishes, sweet and savory, you can make. Nothing beats a running yolk.”
 (
, Barcelona): Tomato. “If it didn’t exist, it would have to be invented. The wide range of varieties means you must know what’s in season.”
 (
, London): Lemon juice. “It’s essential for all seasoning, be it fish, seafood, crustacea or vegetables. Also the zest for stews or to scent a salad.”
 (
, New York): Black truffle. “It’s such a mystical ingredient and so delicate to cook with: You can risk not developing their flavor enough or losing it altogether.”
 (
, Edinburgh): Grouse. “
 (
, Dubai): Curry leaf. “It’s a great flavor on its own, wonderful to use to make butters, oils, flavored naans, biryanis, soups, etc.”
 (
, London): Horseradish. “It has a tempered heat. It’s not as aggressive as chili or mustard or wasabi, and it goes really well with beef.”
 (
, London): Zucchini. “When you get them from your own farm, you see them in every color, shape and variety, with incredible flowers, too.”
 (Ex-
, Hong Kong): Cauliflower. “Roast it with turmeric and garlic and butter and it has a deep and complex flavor.”
 (
, London): Onions. “They are versatile. Most Indian dishes start with an onion. They are a key ingredient, along with ginger, garlic and chilies.”
 (
, London): Iberico pork. “Portugal has wonderful produce, and I champion Iberico pork in particular. There’s nothing like it.”

=== Title: Mint Julep Recipe - Bloomberg ===

The mint julep—one of William Faulkner’s favorite drinks and the first thing we see Clark Gable holding in 
–is as quintessentially Southern as buttermilk biscuits. But it’s also the granddaddy of summer cocktails, keeping drinkers cool in the heat since the late 18th century, when early-rising Virginia farmers took to downing them in the morning.
Today, you can sip a mint julep from California to New Jersey and have it made with everything from mezcal to gin; but the classic bourbon-based version is the one that belongs on your home-bartending short list when temperatures start climbing toward triple digits.
It’s a simple but powerful mixture of whiskey, mint, sugar, and ice that few other cocktails can rival—a drink “fit for an emperor,” in the words of Gilded Age barman Jerry Thomas. “It’s sensory overload,” said Alba Huerta, owner of the bar, Julep, in Houston. “There’s the aroma from the mint, the feeling of the cold julep cup in your hand, the flavor of the whiskey, and the mint and the sugar.”
Making one requires a little more care and skill than putting together a gin and tonic, but the process is part of the great pleasure: crushing the ice, muddling the mint to release its oils and aroma, and stirring it until the tin’s so cold it sticks to your fingers. No wonder this beloved hot-weather ritual has endured for more than 200 years.
2 oz bourbon (overproof or bonded is preferable; the better the whiskey, the better the drink)
½ oz simple syrup
1 bunch of mint
Lots of ice
Add eight mint leaves to the bottom of a julep tin or old-fashioned glass and lightly muddle—tapping or rolling the muddler across the leaves with a little pressure will help avoid shredding the leaves and making them bitter. Add the simple syrup and bourbon and fill the cup most of the way with crushed ice. (Smash cubes with a mallet or meat tenderizer.) Stir the ice until the tin cup begins to develop a frost or the glass grows cold. Add more ice as it dissolves, and taste periodically to measure flavor and temperature. When it’s properly cold, add ice to the top of the cup or above and garnish with a bouquet of mint as large as you like.
Connoisseurs hold a julep only by the rim to preserve the chill, and stick in two straws cut low enough that you get your nose into the bouquet so as to enjoy the mint’s full effect.

=== Title: America’s Inequality Machine Is Sending the Dow Soaring - Bloomberg ===

The Great Recession is a speck in the rear-view mirror for America’s financial markets. They’ve advanced far beyond pre-crisis levels. In fact, Goldman Sachs 
 you can go back a century before 2008, and still not find a “bull market in everything” like today’s.
If the real economy had roared back the same way, 
 might not be president. Instead, it’s been a grind. While unemployment is near a two-decade low, wages have grown slowly by past standards. They’re nowhere near keeping pace with the asset-price surge.
Elected on a promise of better jobs and pay, Trump is about to pull the most powerful lever any government has for firing up the economy: fiscal policy. By slashing taxes on corporate profits, its authors say, the Republican 
 will unleash the animal spirits of American business -- and everyone will benefit.
A rising tide does lift all boats -- but nowadays, in the U.S., not equally. Under both parties, recoveries have become increasingly lopsided. The current one has helped millions of people find work; it’s also benefited asset-owners far more than people who trade their labor for a paycheck. Income distribution, already the most unequal in the developed world, is getting worse. And that’s starting to influence everything from America’s spending habits to its elections.
“The story of our time is polarization -- by party, by class and by income,” said Mark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital in Washington, and co-author of a 2017 book about the Federal Reserve. “I don’t see anything in the tax bill to make that any better.’’
The Fed’s post-2008 toolkit included massive purchases of financial assets, which supported a liftoff on the markets but took time to trickle through to the real economy. Trump’s tax critics say his plan will have a similar effect, because companies will spend the windfall on share buybacks or dividends, instead of job-creating investments. Plenty of executives say that’s 
.
Bank of America’s most recent 
 program totals $18 billion. Chairman Brian Moynihan championed the tax proposal this month. “It’s good for corporate America, and it’s good for us,” he 
.
There was an echo there of one of the American business world’s 
. As applied to the Trump tax cuts, it’s highly misleading, according to Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors.
This isn’t a case of “what’s good for General Motors is good for the U.S.,” said Minow, who’s dedicated her career to pushing corporations toward long-term investments in people and businesses. “In my list of the top 100 things companies should do for sustainable wealth creation, buybacks would be number 100.”
Companies in the S&P 500 Index bought $3.5 trillion of their own stock between 2010 and 2016, almost 50 percent more than in the previous expansion. The pace has slowed in the last two years. The tax bill could 
. 
Buybacks have fueled the stock rally (there’s disagreement about how 
 they played). And the rally’s biggest benefits go to the richest. On Twitter last week, Trump invited his followers to check their swelling retirement accounts. Only about half the country’s households have any such 
.
Soaring markets helped the top 1 percent of Americans increase their slice of the national wealth to 39 percent in 2016, according to the Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances. The bottom 90 percent of families held a one-third share in 1989; that’s now shrunk to less than one-quarter.
Republicans are gambling that they can run the economy so hot that companies will hire more workers, and eventually boost their wages. There’s a strong argument that the private sector can train them better than government programs can.
“The more growth we have, the more that benefits everybody,” said Ike Brannon, a former Bush administration Treasury official who’s now president of Capital Policy Analytics, a consulting firm. “It forces businesses to train people at the fringes.” He points to the late 1990s, when growth averaged more than 4 percent and the poorest one-fifth of households saw substantial income gains.
Looming in the background then was a technology-stocks bubble. It burst in March 2000, plunging the economy into recession. What happened next is telling -- it illustrates the perverse asymmetry of bubbles. In the following three years, those poorest households saw their incomes fall more than twice as much as their richest counterparts.
The pattern was repeated after the even bigger housing crash of late 2007. Today, even after an increase of more than 9 percent over two years, incomes at the bottom are short of pre-crisis peaks, while higher earners have comfortably surpassed them.
Japan, which is also preparing corporate tax cuts, 
 to make them available only to businesses that increase spending on wages and investment. In the U.S., companies are flush with cash but they’re using it to buy more customers via mergers, or reward capital through dividends, according William Spriggs, chief economist at the AFL-CIO, the country’s biggest labor union group. 
American workers won’t put up with any more business cycles that yield them few gains, he says. “This is the last time they can get away with it, because the backlash is going to be huge.”
In the end, the trend toward inequality amounts to capitalist suicide, Spriggs argues. Companies need demand, which requires rising wages so that workers can afford goods and services. “Businesses can’t create themselves, they respond to general growth in income,” he said. “Inequality chokes off business development.”
Support for that kind of argument is surfacing in unlikely quarters.
The International Monetary Fund used to be so entwined with American government thinking that its preferred market-friendly recipe was known as the Washington Consensus. Now, the Fund is cautiously backing redistributive measures -- 
 of the Trump administration in the process.
In October, the IMF 
 rich countries can share their prosperity more evenly, without sacrificing growth, by shifting more of the tax burden onto high earners. It warned that “excessive inequality can erode social cohesion, lead to political polarization, and ultimately lower economic growth.”
The U.S. is already experiencing some of those strains.
During last year’s election campaign, both major parties effectively broke in half. In both cases, an outsider candidate scored unexpected wins by running against the party establishment, and railing at an economic system they said was rigged against ordinary Americans.
Self-described socialist Bernie Sanders surprised pundits by mounting a serious challenge in the Democratic contest. Trump won his party’s nomination and the presidency. He told voters he had experience on the buy-side of American politics, having paid for favors from both parties, and so was well-placed to fix a “broken system” dominated by corporate lobbyists.
Now, Trump is about to hand corporations -- which are already making high profits by historical standards -- a giant tax cut. The bill “addresses problems we don’t have, and makes existing problems worse,” said Alan Krueger, an economics professor at Princeton University. “Especially the deficit, inequality, health care, and infrastructure investment.”
If the tax changes end up helping markets most, they’ll be widening a gap noted last month by JPMorgan Chase’s chief investment strategist, Jan Loeys. There’s not much sign of “economic overheating,” which happens when companies start spending more on wages and other inputs, Loeys argued. “Financial overheating, in contrast, is well advanced,” he wrote. “It merits monitoring a lot more closely for signs of bubble-trouble.” 
Even Trump’s Treasury has flagged the danger. Last week, the Office of Financial Research made its annual 
 to Congress on the vulnerabilities of the financial system. It was sanguine about most of them, from inflation and bank solvency to debt levels.
But the agency, which color-codes its assessments, did see one major threat -- from market risk. That gauge is at red alert.
