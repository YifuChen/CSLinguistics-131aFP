While salaried workers generally can\u2019t choose when they get paid, business owners can often delay registering\u00a0income until the following year, lowering their April tax bill\u00a0in the process. Investors can also control their taxable income\u2014and thus lower capital\u00a0gains tax bills\u2014by selling losing stocks\u00a0or\u00a0waiting to sell winning stocks until 2018.\u00a0In most years, deferring income merely delays the taxes you will have to pay eventually. But, if you expect your tax rate to fall next year, deferring income into 2018 could actually save you money. (There\u2019s also some good news for equity investors ", ".)", "As we noted, the tax bill would limit how much state and local taxes (or SALT) individuals can deduct, to no more than $10,000 of a combination\u00a0of property taxes and either income or sales taxes.

But the final compromise bill, unveiled Friday by Republicans in the Senate and House,\u00a0explicitly closes this loophole with respect to income taxes. Any\u00a02018 state and local income taxes paid ahead of time would nevertheless need to be\u00a0counted on next year\u2019s taxes, according to the bill. However, taxpayers\u00a0could still pre-pay property taxes due in 2018, and deduct them under the old rules.

The tax bill ends these itemized deductions after the end of this\u00a0year. So, workers should think about whether they can pay \u2014and get the receipts\u2014for as many\u00a0of these expenses as possible this month, said Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block in Kansas City, Missouri. Examples of unreimbursed expenses for employees might include tools and supplies, occupational taxes, work uniforms, union dues, and expenses for work-related travel. Self-employed people and business owners would still be able to deduct expenses under the new tax bill.\u00a0", "Under the proposed law, you\u2019ll no longer be allowed to deduct work-related moving expenses after the new year (unless you\u2019re in the military).

(Downforce is important for keeping a car stable as it accelerates and moves through space at high speed.) That proved the key factor to making the Agera RS faster than the more\u00a0powerful, more expensive, more insane One:1. Where the One:1 was aerodynamically calibrated specifically to handle the curves of a track\u2014the shape of its front splitter, rear wing, and air vents all direct the flow of air in the way that eases changes in direction and speed\u2014Koenigsegg calibrated the Agera RS to optimize movement in a straight line.", "\u201cAgera doesn\u2019t quite have the same quite dramatic aerodynamics [as the One:1], which it means it has less drag,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWith less drag,\u00a0you\u2019re able to cut through the air quicker; with slightly less downforce, it\u2019s better suited to a top speed, so this car was almost always a better candidate for a top speed record.\u201d", "The other main factors that allowed the Agera RS to excel in Nevada are much more mundane: tires and logistics.", "After all, the Agera RS has been available since 2015. The car that set the record is a true production vehicle, so in theory Koenigsegg could have set the record back then. But it was only within the past six months that Michelin began working directly with Koenigsegg to go for a moon shot.", "\u201cTires are critical when you\u2019re talking about a high-speed run like this\u2014they are the potential weak link,\u201d Wade said. \u201cIf anything should go wrong with a tire, you\u2019ve got a potentially fatal situation, to be honest.\u201d", "For instance, that tiny valve stem where you put air into the tires on your 911 weighs 30 grams when you hold it in your hand. That\u2019s about equal to a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses. But when it\u2019s rotating at 450\u00a0km/hour, it weighs closer to 170 kilograms, or 375 pounds, he said. That\u2019s enough to affect the handling of the car\u00a0or do serious damage as a flying object should anything go wrong. \u00a0", "\u201cIt\u2019s the centrifugal force,\u201d Wade said. \u201cSo we had to rotate a wheel with that part in to make sure it would hold up. This hadn\u2019t been done before, so we had to make sure. Luckily, it passed with flying colors.\u201d", "The deeper challenge was to mitigate heat, tire pressure, and wear at speeds faster than some airplanes travel at takeoff. For the Koenigsegg run, Michelin conducted the testing sessions at an aircraft testing facility in Michigan. Where some tires may have been able to sustain a high speed for a few seconds, these tires needed to be able to repeatedly withstand high speeds for minutes at a time.", "\u201cWhen you\u2019re traveling at 250\u00a0mph, you\u2019ve got to control for the growth of the tire,\u201d Schmedding said.

They were also made without the seams in the rubber that \u201cnormal\u201d tires have, which can create heavy spots in the tire when run at high speeds.", "As with every other component of the record-setting car\u2014the aspect that makes it so exciting to driving enthusiasts everywhere\u2014the tires are available for sale to anyone who can afford their retail price of $300 to $400 per tire.", "Clothing retailer Mark Stidham could afford the tires along with the car. It was his idea to go for the record (talk about bragging rights), and he was the first Agera RS owner to make his own car available for the attempt. Koenigsegg needed the support: There\u2019s a three- to four-year waiting list for people who have already paid to buy Koenigsegg\u2019s current car, the Regara; each of the 80 to be made were assigned to buyers long ago. As for the Agera RS, the brand will make only 25, plus three final edition cars.", "\u201cWe only build cars for customers,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe did have plans to build an RS for ourselves, but we had sold the entire allocation that we were going to build, so we didn\u2019t even have a demonstrator.\u201d", "It helped that Stidham reportedly has friends in the film industry. Those guys know how to shut down entire stretches of highway, a feat that takes no small effort to work through paperwork, permits, transport, fees, and scheduling. One of the reasons that 80-year-old flying-kilometer record stood for so long was simply that no one had taken the time to beat it.", "Not that the challenge will keep Bugatti away. Or Hennessey, for that matter. Not by a long shot.", "In a written statement, the Volkswagen-owned company said it \u201ccongratulates Koenigsegg on this achievement\u201d and is \u201cpleased to see that several super sports car manufacturers have entered the competition for records in the high speed range.\u201d", "\u201cAs announced at the Frankfurt International Motor Show a few weeks ago,\u00a0Bugatti\u00a0will be making its next high-speed drive in 2018,\u201d the emailed statement said, referring to an anticipated run with the Chiron. The Chiron is limited to 500 vehicles, more than 300 of which have already been sold.", "\u201cIn the future, we will maintain our philosophy of building a production super sports car that is not only designed for maximum speed but also meets the highest possible demands in terms of luxury, comfort, everyday drivability and durability,\u201d Bugatti said. \u201cThe new Chiron combines the best in all these areas which makes it the world\u2019s most complete super sports car and a unique concept.\u201d", "Outsiders expect the response to pack a resounding wallop.", "\u201cKoenigsegg took this record from Bugatti, who we work very closely with as well,\u201d said Michelin\u2019s Schmedding, who due to confidentiality agreements declined to give additional specifics about future projects. \u201cI\u2019m sure they will plan to answer in 2018 with the Chiron. We expect that will happen.\u201d", "Sitting in his office in Sweden, Wade also anticipates an answer from Bugatti.

When Serota took over its single building in the 1970s, through sheer force of will he raised the funds to open the Tate Liverpool (1988) and the Tate St. Ives (1993) and to purchase the derelict power station in Bankside, across the river from St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, that would become the Tate Modern (2000).

(Bloomberg LP, which owns ", ", is a major donor to the Tate.) And so, over the past decade or two, the Tate Modern has put on inoffensive blockbusters such as the exhibition of Matisse cutouts in 2014.

Most of these reasons\u00a0for his relative lack of popularity appear to come down to a dearth\u00a0of art-historical awareness from collectors, an absence of aggressive gallery support, and, to a much lesser extent, concerns regarding the long-term condition of the work.

And in\u00a0America, at least, they don\u2019t sell in large numbers. Last year, Audi sold 2,300 of these A4 Allroads, compared with 34,687 of its A4 sedan. In January 2017, Audi sold 222, a\u00a049 percent increase over the same period for 2016, but that was still fewer\u00a0than the e-Tron, Audi\u2019s plug-in hybrid.

In\u00a0the 1960s and 1970s, the family car was the station wagon. At the time, the wagons were oblong, unwieldy, embarrassing sloops of metal. They were the only choice for those who needed a vehicle big enough for a family but didn\u2019t want to throw the kids in the back of a pickup.", "But by 1980, SUVs\u00a0had started to emerge. Automakers realized they could sell these high-riding sport utes as the cool, independent ", " choice for families. Pretty soon, they began to dominate with such offerings as\u00a0the Lexus RX, Chevy Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade, and Chevy Suburban; cool dads and affluent weekend warriors alike could pick these large, utilitarian vehicles without resorting to the wagons that recalled their own nausea-inducing childhood road trips\u2014or worse, minivans, which emerged in 1983 with the Dodge Caravan.", "So by the time Audi, Mercedes, and BMW catapulted their own exceptionally sporty wagons into the U.S. in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was too little, too late. There was no chance of mass domination or even the warm embrace of avants, as versions of the wagon are called in ", ". Subaru\u2019s Outback and Volvo\u2019s \u201cV\u201d wagons never really left, but those sell to even smaller pockets of enthusiasts who live in mystical places such as\u00a0Oregon and Maine.", "\u00a0", "I highly recommend the one I drove.

That\u2019s an advantage in some ways, because staying out of their sales-numbers death match every year (BMW and Mercedes trade top honors every other year or so) allows Audi more freedom to present itself as the option for progressive free thinkers and young spirits.", "The interior of the Allroad matches this philosophy. The dashboard is low and slim with lateral vents across the front set off by a high-resolution control screen on top. There\u2019s also a 12.3-inch virtual cockpit behind the steering wheel that shifts\u00a0from a classic-dial display to a panoramic setting depicting maps, driving systems, and other assistance settings.

I promise.", "The moment you open the trunk, though, you will remember this is a wagon. While the back seat is expectedly spacious, and the headroom at both front and back is enough for us tall folks to love, it is the trunk that somehow does that magic thing that great cars do, which is offer more space inside than what an outside cursory glance would guess. And though the cargo space is not quite as large as the\u00a0BMW in this category, the split-folding rear seatback offers able\u00a0functionality\u2014it folds flat and wide enough to slide in furniture, appliances, snowboards, or bicycles.

The book\u2019s most illuminating portions highlight how closely interwoven the artist\u2019s social life was with his professional success.

So while Perl carefully details Calder\u2019s social gifts and role as expansive host and charming houseguest at English country estates, he discounts any impact it might have had on the artist\u2019s career. \u201cVariations on this portrait of Calder as a sly opportunist reappeared throughout his life,\u201d Perl writes. \u201cThe accusations were unfounded.\u201d", "The book ends in the early 1940s, when Calder had officially made it.

These are each the midsize four-door sedans in their respective brand\u2019s range.

Ghost is squarer at the front\u2014emotionally and literally. The hood is longer, angled at the edges, and often (unfortunately) painted in the two-tone mode. Its single headlights are streamlined and minimal, and the grill is tall, with long vertical slats set up underneath the iconic Spirit of Ecstasy lady sculpted above. A 24-karat gold hood ornament and 21-inch silver alloy wheels are optional. As a closet introvert who has driven both cars in some of the best neighborhoods in L.A. and New York, I can tell you that the Rolls creates much more of a scene when you drive it. You\u2019ve got to be ready, emotionally, to handle the attention.", "The Flying Spur has a more rounded countenance, with two sets of rounded dark tint bi-xenon headlights with LED beams and a softly rectangular grill struck through the middle by one bar of bright steel. The \u201cflying B\u201d wings on the front lie flat and nearly flush with the hood of the car. The 21-inch, seven-twin-spoke wheels in glossy black are new on the W12S and are handsome.", "In the rear, the Bentley roofline slops toward a short trunk (it looks a little slouchy, to my eye). The overriding feel is evenly muscular rather than the statelier Ghost. The lines on the Rolls are bolder, more blunt. I like that. But as with fashion, you\u2019ve got to be able to handle it: Wear the car. Don\u2019t let the car wear you.", "This, then, is the determining factor: Do you want a powerful sedan that you can drive with real purpose, even aggressively\u2014one that is the perfect blend from the company that makes Her Majesty the Queen\u2019s State Limousine and the world champion GT3 endurance racer? Choose the Flying Spur. It is more dynamic to drive and more engaging as a red-blooded sedan.", "On the other hand, do you want to feel like an emperor in the backseat, with all the pomp and circumstance associated therein?

But before Deepak Chopra and Dr. Oz and Goop, there was Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. In 1878 he opened the Battle Creek Sanitarium, the Canyon Ranch of its time, and began promoting his rules for \u201cbiologic living,\u201d a near-religion then. He treated executives, celebrities, and presidents at the San, as it was called; his most devoted followers were known as the Battle Freaks. He sold them special foods, unusual treatments, exercise machines, books, and albums. For 60 years, Kellogg\u2014\u00adprescient and kooky\u2014was the most famous doctor in America.", "His life\u2019s work was intertwined with that of his younger brother, Will, who helped run the San before starting the Kellogg cereal company. Their dramatic, poignant family saga is well told by medical historian Howard Markel in\u00a0", "(Pantheon Books, $35). Jealousy, mistrust, and meanness strained their relationship: They sued each other over the cereal company (Will prevailed); took credit separately for shared accomplishments; and, Markel writes, spurred each other on to greater success than they might have otherwise achieved. They were estranged when John died in 1943 at 91. The San couldn\u2019t survive without its charismatic, narcissistic founder, and his contributions to the wellness movement were lost, an omission Markel hopes to correct with this book.", "Many personal accounts at the end of the 19th century include bouts of indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, and dyspepsia, and no wonder. Whether they were wealthy or not, Americans overate, consuming huge amounts of animal fat, salt, and sugar. In the backwoods of Michigan, where the Kelloggs grew up, people ate cured pork with salty canned vegetables and sweetened canned fruit for lunch and dinner; at breakfast they consumed ham or bacon and potatoes fried in congealed fat from the night before. The average woman didn\u2019t live past 41, and the average man only made it to 39.", "John Kellogg, gregarious, intelligent, and obsessed with cleanliness, eventually made his way to medical school in New York, thanks to support from the Seventh-day Adventist Church. When he returned to Michigan, he took over the church\u2019s small health center and converted it into a secular temple to wellness with a suitably dignified name. (He created the word \u201csanitarium\u201d from \u201csanatorium,\u201d a facility for long-term illness.) As Markel writes, he \u201cknew that this institution had to be an attractive, modern, luxurious, worthwhile destination for those wealthy enough to seek such commodities.\u201d", "At its peak, the San employed 1,000 people, cared for as many as 10,000 patients a year, and farmed 400 acres of vegetables and fruit. The place had its own dairy, canning, and food manufacturing facilities. Eventually Kellogg added a resort with 20 cottages \u201creserved for the most wealthy of the worried well.\u201d Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and John D. Rockefeller were regulars. To garner publicity, Kellogg invited Harvey Firestone, J.C. Penney, Alfred du Pont, and the composer John Philip Sousa, among others, for free treatments, prompting some to say that his medical specialty was \u201cdiseases of the rich and famous.\u201d", "Kellogg\u2019s rules for a biologic life make him sound like Michael Pollan\u2014eat grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables, yogurt, and soy milk. Meat and sugar were forbidden. So was masturbation. Smoking was a death wish, obesity a \u201cdefinite health hazard.\u201d Kellogg warned of the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle, advocating regular, vigorous exercise, plus massage, enemas, fresh air and sunlight, spirituality, laughter, sleep, and lots of pure water. He came up with an early, less-edible version of peanut butter and a fiber-rich mix of grains he called granola. He sold psyllium as a laxative (hello, Metamucil) and treated Richard Byrd with acidophilus soy milk\u2014a probiotic\u2014after the admiral\u2019s 1929 expedition to the South Pole. Kellogg also made his own very popular exercise albums with a brass band. Cue Richard Simmons.", "Kellogg promoted some dubious ideas as well: Food should be chewed down to its atomic level; his patients should have four odor-free bowel movements a day; and women should receive pelvic massages, from him, a treatment whose medical purpose no doctor since has been able to explain. The benefits of electrotherapy exercise beds, vibrating chairs, and mechanical horses now seem a little suspect, too.", "Kellogg spent his last years building and running a second sanitarium, outside Miami; he\u2019d left the San after it was forced into receivership during the Depression. Kellogg\u2019s legacy might have been more enduring had he not left his entire estate to his Race Betterment Foundation, which promoted eugenics. And some of his recipes might still be on the market if he hadn\u2019t alienated the brother who could manufacture them. \u201cMany of his sounder concepts of wellness remain sage prescriptions written out millions of times each day,\u201d Markel concludes.

A legal standard called the Howey Test defines an investment contract as a security if you are putting money into a common enterprise with an expectation of profit, primarily from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. The SEC has yet to wade in, but the hotter the ICO market, the greater the potential for abuse or investor losses that could spur the agency to act. Channing suspects the regulators are waiting for the right case. Meeting requirements for a securities sale will mean selling ICOs to accredited investors with a certain level of sophistication and assets.", "The eye-popping gains on coins are drawing more attention to them, a classic precondition of a bubble.

They support increasing the number of bitcoin transactions in each block. Second are the so-called Core developers who have been instrumental in constructing bitcoin\u2019s bug-proof system. Their proposal:\u00a0Allow some data to be moved outside the main network, in effect creating multiple ledgers called sidechains.

Then, in November, bitcoin will face its next big challenge when some of the world\u2019s biggest miners move to adopt phase two, the doubling of the size of the block. That could lead to bitter disagreements. Opponents among the developers argue that increasing block sizes will leave too much power in too few hands, since the technology required will get more expensive.

One attraction is that, in contrast to limitless printed currencies, there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins. And as bitcoin\u2019s market value has surged to $45 billion, the debate has intensified over whether it should embrace more mainstream capitalism or fortify its position as a libertarian beacon.

Its twin-blade grill, high-gloss splitter, and chrome accents, even on the air intake, dressed up the bulging sides and rear enough to catch some looks. Yes, really. Photos don\u2019t do it justice.

While the number of elites vying for upgrade spaces has ballooned, the number of premium airplane seats has remained constant.", "All of this changes the dynamics of supply and demand. Says Leff, \u201cGiven how difficult it is to get upgraded, it incentivizes passengers to confirm their upgrades, for instance by redeeming miles, in advance.\u00a0There are more miles in circulation now, too, so that's become easier as well.\u201d The more fliers who redeem those miles for upgrades ahead of time, the more elite fliers there are commiserating in the back of the plane.", "Even with the dwindling upgrade space and fiercer competition, you can still try your hand at an elite upgrade.

And factors like time of booking or having a co-branded credit card can break ties in hairy situations.", "\u00a0", "Right now, American Airlines prioritizes elite upgrades based on two things: elite status and the time at which the flier is added to the upgrade waitlist. Status trumps upgrade sign-ups, but you can easily increase your chances at scoring an upgrade by booking tickets far in advance and requesting an upgrade immediately.", "But along with major changes that recently hit the AAdvantage program\u2014it now prioritizes dollars spent to miles flown\u2014American recently announced that upgrade eligibility will be changing in 2017.

Some aficionados may say they\u2019re good, but they\u2019re American-style and a bit gauche, so true Mercedes connoisseurs say the race cars are rarer and better, like a French Bordeaux. But the gullwings are like a really great California cab: They\u2019re really expensive, and you can\u2019t deny how good they are.\u201d", "Indeed. The 300 SL is a true collector\u2019s vehicle regardless of whether it lands in the premier spot of a given group. It is a foundational pillar of a complete collection. And right now, it\u2019s hot.", "The 300 SL was the first production gullwing car created and is the grandfather of the modern SLS AMG, the $222,000, 583-horsepower gullwing coupe. \u201cSL\u201d stands for the German phrase \u201c", "\u201d (sport light), so-named for its lightweight aluminum chassis and sporty tubular body (more on that later); the 300 refers to its 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine. \u00a0", "Mercedes debuted the 300 SL at the New York Auto Show in 1954, where it became an instant success largely because of its iconic doors but also because of its link to success on the track; its direct predecessor, the W194, had won prestigious races like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the\u00a0Eifelrennen\u00a0at\u00a0N\u00fcrburgring, and Mexico's\u00a0Carrera Panamericana.", "The story goes that Mercedes\u2019s New York distributor, Max Hoffman, followed the wins closely and suggested to the boys back at corporate that affluent Americans newly wealthy post-World War II would certainly buy a road-legal version. So Mercedes decided to give them one. \u00a0", "The 300 SL had a welded aluminum tube\u00a0chassis designed to compensate for its relatively underpowered engine; its main body was steel, with a hood, doors, and trunk lid all made from aluminum, to save even more weight. So the car was light (just over 3,400 pounds) and strong, but its design also made traditional doors impossible. Which is exactly why Mercedes developed the doors-open-up style.", "\u201cThose doors were almost an afterthought,\u201d Moran said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of these form and function details that have become part of its allure.\u201d", "Aerodynamics helped determine that famous form as well: Engineers placed those straight metal \"eyebrows\" over each of the wheel openings to reduce drag.", "And that odd body shape also birthed the \u201cpower domes\u201d on Mercedes hoods that we\u2019ve seen so many times since its era. The domes\u2014slight bulges in the hood\u2014were made to accommodate the inline-six engine in the 300 SL, which had to be tilted up at an unusual angle in order to fit in the unnaturally low front cavity. One of the small bumps in the hood was made to fit over the top part; the other was added just to match the first.", "\u201cThe first was functional, and the second was functional aesthetically,\u201d Moran said. \u201cIt was all about symmetry.\u201d\u00a0", "Under those domes, the SL had the world\u2019s first-ever production direct-injection engine, which had barely been featured yet, even in race cars.

It could hit 60 mph in eight\u00a0seconds.\u00a0", "Paired under the engine was a rear suspension design with a dual-pivot swing axle famously prone to slipping and sliding and oversteering at every opportunity (the roadster featured a redesigned single-pivot axle, which made the car much more neutral to handle and less prone to oversteer). It had progressively precise steering, a four-wheel independent suspension that made it comfortable to drive, a four-speed manual transmission, and even air conditioning on later models.", "Think of it as the historic equivalent to the modern McLaren F1 or Ferrari LaFerrari. Driving one, Moran said, is a life-changing experience.", "\u201cIt is basically a race car: It\u2019s got an amazing engine that wants to run all day, the handling is great, it makes all these amazing noises,\u201d he said about the all-black 1955 300 SL he drove for days during the famous Italian Mille Miglia car race last year. \u201cIt does run a little hot, so when you pull in to get gas, you open the doors to let it air out a little, but you\u2019re also putting on the greatest spectator show. People go nuts. It\u2019s instant international relations.\u201d", "In fact, the 300 SL changed Mercedes\u2019s image in America from that of a quiet German car company that made staid luxury sedans to one that could also dominate a field of high-performance whips. Sophia Loren, Tony Curtis, Clark Gable, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Stavros Niarchos all owned one.", "Of course, all that cachet comes with a price. Original 300 SLs had a starting price of around $11,000, more than twice as expensive as the general $5,000 Cadillac convertible. Mercedes made only 1,400 or so before switching to the open-top roadster version, heavier but easier to drive (better brakes, better suspension, that single rear axle), in 1957.", "And since then, well, the sticker price has skyrocketed. In 2014, Russo & Steele ", " a \u201956 Gullwing SL for $1.32 million; earlier this month, Bonhams ", " a \u201955 Gullwing SL for $1.34 million.

While gullwings may do up to $2 million, roadsters generally hit between $1.4 million and $1.6 million. That\u2019s because of the coupe\u2019s singular gullwing design, which didn\u2019t reappear again on the production market until the 1970s and \u201980s (", " or DeLorean, anyone?), and because the coupe was closer in design and philosophy to the original racers.\u00a0", "Either version, though, makes men drool.", "\u201cThe cool thing about both the Gullwing and the Roadster 300 SL is that if you have the money to buy one, any single one of them, you know you have a world-class car,\u201d Hagerty said. \u201cThere are rarer Mercedes, but no one is ever going to look at an SL in someone\u2019s garage and thumb their nose at it.\u201d", "The SL is one of the few cars that have universal appeal, with consistent strong interest from the top collectors the world over. Unlike, say, a Chevrolet Corvette, which is popular to collect for American buyers but not as much for European or Asian money, the Mercedes-Benz SL is not regionally specific. According to data from Hagerty, the average price of a 1956 300 SL Gullwing in 2006 was $450,000. This year, it\u2019s $1.6 million. Similarly, a 1962 SL Roadster averaged $350,000 in 2006; now it\u2019s $1.7 million.", "Here\u2019s your caveat, though: The SLs have become more prevalent on the auction block in recent years. Last summer at the Monterey auctions, the number for sale was close to 30; it was more like a dozen or so in previous years. The explanation is simple: People who realize they have a million-dollar opportunity sitting in their garage tend to want to sell. Hagerty said the increased popularity will eventually slow the stellar investment gains but that the car\u2019s increasing value will remain \u201cvery stable\u201d for the foreseeable future.", "\u201cThey absolutely have proven to be good investments,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cFor a buyer looking for that world-class car but who doesn\u2019t want to spend $6 million on something more rare, they\u2019re very safe cars to buy.\u201d", "(", ", here\u2019s a car-world life hack: If you want something similar to the 300 SL but don\u2019t have the extra million, consider the smaller 190 SL coupe, which looks similar but usually sells for ", ".)\u00a0", "Those who do go for the big fish will reap plenty of joy, experts say. The SL is one of the few blue-chip vintage cars viable as a weekend driver\u2014even if its affections don\u2019t come cheap. Like any high-performing athlete, it requires close maintenance.", "\u201cYou do have to worry about the care and feeding of the SL,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a modern car where you can just hop in and turn the key and go for a ride. You\u2019re looking at a $12,000 or $13,000 repair job just to get something like the radiator replaced.\u201d\u00a0", "Not that anyone who paid $2 million for a weekend driver is going to quibble over 10 grand.

As a result, stateroom floor plans are (on average) 23 percent larger than before, with bathrooms gaining an extra 20 percent of square footage. This is a feat of engineering much larger than meets the eye: Currently, balconies help distribute the weight of a boat, and bringing them indoors requires boatbuilders to redesign\u00a0the vessel's support system.\u00a0Making ships bigger isn't the answer if you're looking for increased square footage, either, as many ships are already too large to dock in popular ports.

People care for spaces that they can pick food from.\u201d", "That's exactly what appealed to the approving committee at the New York City Parks Department. \"We are trying to prioritize community engagement,\" said Bram Gunther, co-director of the Urban Field Station, who cited a growing field of study that believes that\u00a0community involvement, empowerment, and land management must all go hand in hand. \"This project will act like a magnet, in a way, and inspire people to civic action,\" he added.\u00a0", "That's exactly Mattingly's plan.

Even if she fails to create her public farm in the South Bronx, she will likely open up a dialogue\u00a0that can lead to\u00a0lasting public policy impacts.\u00a0", "And let's not ignore the twin goal of creating public stewards, which Gunther says is what he most looks forward to seeing. \"The benefits start\u00a0with people going to Swale and thinking about it\u2014being more aware.

It just so happens that now, as baby boomers age, millennials are gaining sway.\u00a0", "It\u2019s also a result of the simultaneous ubiquity and sky-high prices of Ferraris at blue-chip auctions: Discerning buyers will naturally move toward models that are easier to get, massively cheaper, and sometimes just more fun to play with.", "\u201cMaybe those guys can\u2019t all afford a Lamborghini, but things like the \u201980s Mustangs and Corvettes are pretty attainable,\u201d Hagerty says. \u201cThese things are out there.

This is not how food delivery normally works; the best thing about it is you can get lots of different kinds of food, but usually it's just one genre at a time.", "And yet for Chang, this plate full of highlights from Ando, his new\u00a0NYC-based food delivery service, has\u00a0profound meaning.", "\u201cGrowing up in suburban Virginia, going to the mall was the highlight of the week. This is essentially the greatest hits of the food court,\u201d says Chang. \u201cI\u2019d go with my friends and we\u2019d each get one dish\u2014Asian noodles, cheesesteak\u2014and assemble them on the table. This is a dream plate.\u201d", "\u201cYup,\u201d says J.J.

Choices include vegetarian fried rice; chef Basil deepens the flavor of it by adding bonji, a fermented seasoning. There's also\u00a0a supersonic version of the traditional deep-fried crab Rangoon dumpling; this iteration\u00a0is\u00a0a spring roll with mashed potatoes mixed in to lighten up the cream cheese filling.", "People can give feedback on the Lab dishes, helping determine what makes it onto the Ando menu. What\u2019s more, those who order and interact the most with the Ando team can \u201cunlock\u201d secret dishes. Chang and Basil talk in hushed tones about a deep-fried cheesesteak that might soon be available to top customers.", "Still, what Chang believes makes Ando singular in the world of food delivery is the food itself. He chose a chef who has experience unlike most delivery cooks: Basil trained at Noma in Copenhagen, RyuGin in Tokyo, and WD-50 in New York. At Ando, he works as an R&D chef, reverse-engineering dishes to make sure they're as good\u2014or better\u2014after they\u2019re delivered.", "The bonji in the fried rice is not a typical delivery-food ingredient. When Chang decided to put a Philadelphia cheesesteak on Ando\u2019s menu\u2014as the kind of dish that people crave when they're hungry, and therefore ideal for delivery\u2014Basil made countless versions until he found one that had plenty of cheese sauce but not so much that the sandwich bread was a soggy mess after delivery.", "\u201cIt looks like a traditional cheesesteak, and we\u2019re not trying to mess with Philadelphia,\u201d says Chang. \u201cSo I call it an NYC cheesesteak. We added chickpea hozon [a miso-like condiment] because hozon has notes of pecorino and parmesan and gives the sauce a fuller, more delicious flavor.\u201d Chang firmly believes that Basil, or a chef like him, has the potential to be one of America\u2019s great new chefs.", "For that to be any more than a\u00a0dream, people have to be able to taste the food, which is where it gets trickier. One drawback for Ando has been its\u00a0slow rollout. Having launched in May, Ando\u2019s delivery is still available only in Manhattan\u2019s Midtown East district and slowly expanding westward. It\u2019s not often that midtown has a culinary edge on places like Brooklyn, but for Ando, lunch-desperate midtown is\u00a0delivery-food ground zero.", "One reason Ando is so well-focused is that Chang has been working on the idea for more than a decade. He credits a well-known friend, chef Mario Batali, with planting the idea for Ando in his head. When Momofuku Noodle Bar opened, the lines were soon two and three hours long. One of the first loyal customers was Batali. \u201cHe never waited on line,\u201d says Chang. \u201cNot because he was a celebrity\u2014because we never let anyone cut\u2014but because he would come early for lunch. And he\u2019d complain, \u2018Why can\u2019t I get this for dinner? I just want this delivered.\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cOf course, I listen to Mario,\u201d Chang continues. He hung out at Batali\u2019s pizza place Otto and saw that it was doing new things in the world of food delivery, like\u00a0wrapping its cured meat in paper and stuffing it into architecture tubes, for neat and stylish delivery. \u201cThey were selling full meals,\u201d says Chang. \u201cAnd they weren\u2019t selling food that wasn\u2019t supposed to be delivered. Their No. 1 pizza at Otto had an egg on it, but they wouldn\u2019t sell that pizza for delivery.\u201d", "That idiosyncratic strategy helped convince Chang not to deliver the dishes that crowds lined up for at Noodle Bar. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to rob the individual that was waiting in line so patiently for their food when someone could literally be eating it in their boxers, complaining that the ramen wasn\u2019t that good,\u201d he says. (He allows that they will have Momofuku delivery when he can be sure the technology and the food will be great.)", "\u201cThe future of dining in New York, and maybe America at large, is certainly going to be affected by delivery,\u201d Chang says. \u201cIf mobile technology has already changed how you get your mail and your dry cleaning and everything else, of course it\u2019s majorly disrupting how people get their food.\u201d", "On top of changes in technology, the increasing costs of labor and real estate make restaurants a prohibitively expensive proposition. Still, Chang is old school. \u201cI\u2019m committed, more than ever, to improving my brick-and-mortar restaurants,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe in that dining experience; it\u2019s why I exist and it\u2019s not going to go away. If anything, experiential dining is going to be more important. If front-of-the-house staff have fewer\u00a0customers to focus on, they can shower more attention on the guests that do come into the restaurant.\u201d He is, at least for now, determined that Ando won\u2019t injure or kill restaurant culture.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have plans for more delivery models. He points out that Chinese food, which increasingly\u00a0dominates Ando\u2019s menu as it evolves, is the No. 2 delivery-food option in the country; the No. 1 choice is pizza. Would Chang consider going head-to-head with the legions of pizza delivery places in New York? \u201cI have a lot of pizza dreams,\u201d Chang says, and laughs. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for Batali and all my Italian chef friends to feel threatened.

Here\u2019s how it works: You pick a country or region, and Black Tomato will find a pristine parcel of land on which to build you a fully customized pop-up hotel, complete with staff and meals and excursions. You choose everything from the view to the bed linens to the bottles in your pop-up wine cellar. It\u2019s tailor-made travel in the most literal way ever.", "\u201cPeople use the words \u2018tailor made\u2019 so ubiquitously these days. What does that even mean anymore?\u201d said Tom Marchant, co-founder of Black Tomato, who conceived of\u00a0Blink as a response to the traction he saw from pop-up retail concepts. \u201cTemporary experiences really excite people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey create a sense of urgency.\u201d", "For Marchant, this is the direction that luxury is moving in. He says his personal definition of luxury is something that\u2019s truly unique and can\u2019t be replicated, and hoteliers far and wide agree. But there\u2019s only so much customizing that a hotel can pull off. \u201cBespoke bath amenities\u201d will be bespoke to a property\u2019s design, not to the guests\u2019 individual wishes; \u201ccustomized excursions\u201d are often just tweaks to tried and true itineraries.", "But those who create a trip using Blink will have\u2014by Marchant\u2019s calculations\u2014751,074,508,800 total trip combinations to choose from after all the granular details are factored in.", "So where to begin? An epic location. Black Tomato has built its name off exceptional access to remote places, and\u00a0Marchant\u2019s team has spent roughly 18 months laying the groundwork for this new project. \u201cBlink is available anywhere in the world,\u201d Marchant said\u2014and he means it. (Yes, that includes the Arctic.) But he and his team will inspire clients with such far-flung and exotic locations as\u00a0the salt flats in Bolivia or Australia\u2019s Kimberly region. Safari-goers might set up in Namibia or the Kalahari; culture fiends can head to Rajasthan or Myanmar\u2019s Inle Lake; and action fanatics can choose from ski trips in Switzerland, northern lights spotting in Iceland, or riding the sand dunes in the Moroccan desert. These are all among Marchant\u2019s favorites\u2014and hardly compromise an exhaustive list.", "Once the general location is set, travelers can get into the nitty gritty of designing their pop-up hotel from the ground up. In an effort to leave no trace behind, Marchant chose semipermanent (but high-design) tents as the format for all Blink pop-ups, but you can choose from a variety of styles: canvas, domes, bubbles, yurts, tropical villa tents, and a few more. Then everything from the layout of the beds (yes, real beds) to the patterns on the seat cushions and the brand of bath amenities is up to your personal whim.", "The process can take place\u00a0online\u2014Marchant likened the experience to \u201cchoosing from a room service menu\u201d\u2014or over the phone with an expert, though he also clarified that guests can be as hands-on or hands-off as they want to be. (Even the customization process is customizable.)", "Depending on the remoteness of the location and how established Black Tomato is in that area, it can take three to five months to execute a client\u2019s vision. Not only does it require a logistical superstorm to get all your preferences lined up and installed on site; Black Tomato also has to staff each camp individually. For some guests, that might mean daily housekeeping and a couple of great guides; for others, it could mean a sommelier, chef, and an astronomer for expert-led stargazing sessions. Blink trips include\u00a0meals, excursions, transfers, and everything in between. \u201cWe create the full package,\u201d Marchant explained.", "Blink took a lot of work to get off the ground\u2014but it will quickly become a well-oiled machine, Marchant hopes. Black Tomato expects to start small, commissioning roughly 10-20 trips in the service\u2019s first year and ultimately scaling it into the hundreds. \u201cWe have the infrastructure to support growth on this,\u201d Marchant assured, but he also recognized that it\u2019s not a trip that everyone can (or will) take. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mass proposition\u2014it\u2019s about the right people at the right time in the right place.\u201d", "As for the pricing, that\u2019s fully bespoke, too. According to Marchant, prices can range from $65,784 for a group of six that wants to spend three nights in Morocco to $177,600 for a group of six spending four nights in the Bolivian salt flats. \u201cNeither of these are including airfare, but Black Tomato can arrange flights from anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.", "And while these\u00a0sample bills\u00a0were both representative of group trips, Blink is as appropriate for couples as it is for larger affairs. \u201cI can see a lot of proposals and engagements happening with Blink,\u201d Marchant half-joked. \u201cThe concept works on many levels: honeymooners looking for the ultimate secluded and private experience, family groups looking to celebrate a milestone event or birthday, groups of friends looking to escape together.\u201d After all, it\u2019s as easy to create a single tent as it is to set up five domes or bubbles in a row for your own private pop-up lodge.", "Regardless, each camp will be dismantled as soon as you leave\u2014removing every last trace of its existence\u2014and it\u2019ll never be built the same way again. In other words: Blink, and you\u2019ll miss it. \u201cThat\u2019s what gets the hairs on the neck standing up,\u201d said Marchant. \u201cRight now travelers just talk about hotels and Airbnb. Just wait, in 10 years\u2019 time there\u2019s a chance people will be talking about this\u2014semi-permanent tents\u2014instead.\u201d", "\u00a0"]},

She sneaked wings onto her menu all the same, cutting the knuckle off so the presentation could be somewhat cleaner and more delicate. The wings are braised for a few hours in the oven, then left to dry out before they\u2019re fried; the thin shell of crisp skin gives way to extremely tender, thoroughly seasoned meat. The liquid from the roasting process, made smoky with pork belly, then reduced and seasoned with soy sauce, black vinegar, and a smidge of hoisin, comes on the side for dipping. It\u2019s a fantastic way to start dinner, especially with a glass of the dry Vouvray from Sebastien Brunet on Katia\u2019s list.

Tatiana came close to graduating from the Sorbonne with a degree in English literature but ditched academia for culinary school at the last moment. She worked her way into some of the city\u2019s most glamorous kitchens, showing such promise after six months as an intern at Pascal Barbot\u2019s L\u2019Astrance that the chef called up his mentor, the great Alain Passard\u2014a vegetable whisperer, if you believe in such things\u2014to see if L\u2019Arp\u00e8ge needed a cook. Tatiana worked with Passard for two years.", "As her sister was sweating it out in the kitchen, Katia explored the front of the house. She went to hotel school in Switzerland and then waitressed at the bistro Le Baratin in the Belleville neighborhood of Paris. There Katia learned about the world of natural wines and the way a truly wonderful bistro becomes like an extension of the owner\u2019s living room.", "As a cook, Tatiana mastered not only technique and stamina but also negotiation\u2014dealing with the city\u2019s best purveyors of everything from butter to fish to vegetables.

The purple Brussels sprouts, sweet and as vividly flavored as they are colored, picked when very small, are referred to as young cabbage. \u201cWhen we call it young cabbage, more people order it,\u201d Katia says, laughing.

After the kitchen aggressively chars the edges, the cabbage resembles a frilly dress that got singed in a fire; it tastes sweet and smoky, as if it\u2019s been roasted in a pit.", "Neither of the Levhas has a driver\u2019s license. To pick up some of the esoteric vinegars and specialty Asian ingredients they need, Tatiana rides her dusty black scooter to Belleville\u2019s Chinese grocery stores or over to a Japanese purveyor on Rue Sainte-Anne near the Palais Garnier opera house. Otherwise, she says, she hardly leaves the neighborhood, because why would you?", "Even if you don\u2019t hit the architectural highlights of the 11th\u00a0arrondissement\u2014the neomedieval cathedral on Boulevard Voltaire, the extravagant troubadour facades, the deco doorways\u2014the district is astonishingly lovely.

From the wine bar La Buvette to the lunch canteen Chez Aline, in a former horse butcher shop, to\u00a0the chic expat hangout Bones, small, exciting food businesses are thriving in the 11th. The Levhas were able to get their space, a former coffee shop, because, they say, rent was comparatively low for central Paris, a likely reason for the recent boom.", "Bistros are vital, bistros of all sorts, but there\u2019s something about Le Servan that feels essential to understanding Paris right now. Although it maintains the generous spirit of the classic iteration, the restaurant also offers an accurate representation of the city as it really is: a massive mix, rich with immigrant culture, where the meaning of French food is changing with new influences all the time.", "Later that Friday night, the sweet music of Le Servan is turned up all the way\u2014the slamming drawers of cutlery, the boom-hiss of the espresso machine, the constant ding of a brass bell as the kitchen pass fills up with dishes. A woman in a white tuxedo jacket eats her first bite of roast chicken, fluttering with smoky-sweet bonito flakes, and moans. Soon waitresses in bright-red lipstick and indigo aprons start to pass along the word: The kitchen is out of chicken.", "Tatiana is working quickly and calmly, her dark hair in a tall, Dr. Seuss-ian pile at the top of her head, her cheeks flushed from the heat of the stove.

Over the weekend, the southern chain ", " a three-story, 5,000-square-foot location in Manhattan.", "At the comparatively tiny restaurant, Harlem Shake, the chicken was stuffed inside a soft potato roll with plenty of thickly sliced pickled jalape\u00f1os and a little smear of mayonnaise. A dribble of hot honey was in there, too (and a squeeze-tube full of it at the table, in case you wanted to add more). It was a simple and excellent sandwich: The fried thigh meat was seasoned right through, with a rugged, crunchy surface that gave way to tender, pleasingly salty meat.", "To achieve this, L\u00f3pez-Alt explained he\u2019d soaked the meat in salty, paprika-darkened buttermilk, which tenderized the chicken and helped it retain moisture during cooking. He pulled some marinated pieces from the brine and, to build up the crust, dredged the meat in flour he'd mixed up with a little of the same brine. \"Oooooh,\" an audience member cooed, \"that's how you do it!\" This created tiny lumps that would later, if all went well in the fryer, offer bonus texture and crunch over the surface of each piece.\u00a0", "\u201cI like to heat the oil to about 425 degrees,\u201d\u00a0L\u00f3pez-Alt\u00a0shouted over the clatter of the afternoon rush, \"because as soon as you add the cold meat, the temperature drops down to 300.\u201d That\u2019s right where you want it for cooking the chicken.\u00a0At home, L\u00f3pez-Alt recommends\u00a0doing an initial\u00a0fry and finishing up the chicken on a rack in the oven. The secret to\u00a0extra crunchy chicken, however, is taking it a step farther: Refrigerate the meat overnight and fry it a second time the next\u00a0day just before serving.", "At Harlem Shake, the narrow open kitchen has no oven, so the meat had been fried once earlier, close to midnight, chilled down, and fried a second time this afternoon. The results were magnificent.", "The development of this somewhat labor-intensive chicken technique involved a level of experimentation and attention to detail, fueled by a pure giddy nerdiness, that is often the hallmark of L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s recipes.

Even a basic recipe for scrambled eggs in the new cookbook will involve\u00a0a few pages of explanation first. In this case, it's to make the case for salting early and resting the eggs for 15 minutes with the salt, to help prevent weeping later on (that thing where the cooked eggs release a sad little puddle of water). The recipe itself is just a quarter of a page, though, simple and easy to follow, with photos of every step that give beginner cooks visual clues.", "L\u00f3pez-Alt, who is 35 and lives in San Mateo, Calif., also took his own photographs for the book.

Richard Betts, a master sommelier, decided on grenache as\u00a0the first wine they\u2019re producing together. Their 2014 Sucette will be released this month.\u00a0", "I didn\u2019t used to be much of a grenache fan (with a handful of exceptions) because until recently, the grape was mostly hidden in blends or made into overripe alcoholic bruisers loaded with oak. But in the past few years, the new generation of subtler, lighter, pinot-style examples, such as\u00a0Sucette, changed my mind.\u00a0", "Here\u2019s the backstory. The red version of grenache (there\u2019s a white, too) is one of the world\u2019s most widely planted red grapes. It flourishes in regions from Australia, to California, to South Africa, and it\u2019s an eco-superstar that can withstand droughts.\u00a0", "In Spain, where it\u2019s called garnacha, it\u2019s a huge deal, as it is in France, where it\u2019s the main varietal in great southern Rh\u00f4ne valley blends. Oddly, only a few wines in the Rh\u00f4ne, such as the\u00a0legendary Ch\u00e2teau Rayas, are pure grenache.

Well, like pinot noir, grenache is highly sensitive to where it\u2019s grown and how it\u2019s made. As Rzeszewski points out, soil \u201cmatters a ton\u201d to whether it turns out simple or sublime. Ditto climate and altitude.", "Vines planted on sand, as they are at Rayas, give fresher, lighter wines with more aromas; those on red clay have longer flavors and more structure. If the vines are very old, you get reds with more intense flavor.\u00a0", "In Spain, the new look at grenache started in the 1990s in mountainous Priorat\u2014but the lighter, more aromatic style was pioneered there only a decade ago.\u00a0", "Today\u2019s insider Spanish hot spot is Gredos, an area in the cool, rugged Sierra de Gredos mountain range about 40 miles from Madrid, where tiny plots of old bush vines planted on granite and sand flourish at elevations up to 3,000 feet.

Among them are 30-somethings Daniel Landi and Fernando Garcia, founders of Comando G winery, named for a Japanese superhero cartoon.\u00a0", "Many new grenache makers borrow winemaking techniques used for pinot noir,\u00a0such as\u00a0throwing whole clusters of grapes, even stems, into the fermentation tank to add complexity and spiciness to the wine.", "Stellar grenache is also on the rise big time in Washington State and California, with dozens of bottlings now labeled with the grape's name.\u00a0 Adventurous winemakers started planting it in cool coastal and mountain areas and discovered hidden historic sandy-soil vineyards in Sonoma, Santa Barbara, the Sierra Foothills, and the Central Coast.\u00a0", "Rzeszewski and Betts looked in Spain and California but fell for a tiny parcel of ancient grenache vines growing in sandy soil that they discovered on a trip to Australia\u2019s Barossa Valley. That was it.", "The Sucette label underscores its mellow deliciousness by sporting a picture of soft-focus, slightly open red lips.

In recent years he\u2019s become obsessed with nutrition, creating things like inhalable chocolate and edible water bottles. He teaches only one semester-long class each year: How to Create Things and Have Them Matter, in which 20\u00a0students focus on producing \u201can innovation that in some clear way benefits the world.\u201d With his Moses hair style and collection of floral-printed shirts, he rarely passes as an academic.", "Caf\u00e9 ArtScience is his first restaurant. It\u2019s also a showroom for his inventions. As you enter the modernist space, which opened in October, fluorescent-lit shelves show off Les Whafs, on sale for $225. Next to them are pods of $7.99 dietary supplements that, when placed in aerosol canisters, administer puffs of melatonin or caffeine to the lungs. \u201cI\u2019m able to deliver nutrition without any of the side effects that are sometimes associated with drinking a Red Bull,\u201d Edwards brags.", "At the freezers near the bar, customers use tongs to pluck out $1.99 spheres of ice cream. The size of golf balls, these WikiPearls, as they\u2019re called, are wrapped like grapes in a flavored skin that helps frozen liquids keep their shape as they melt. \u201cEdwards comes to a problem and really wants to get to the truth,\u201d says Terry McGuire of Polaris Partners, who invested in the pearls. \u201cFrom a collaborative perspective, that\u2019s empowering.\u201d In 2014, Edwards and his investors\u2014including other venture capital firms such as Flagship Ventures and Unigestion\u2014licensed the technology to organic yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm. In October the company started distributing WikiPearl frozen yogurt to 38\u00a0Whole Foods stores.", "Despite its retail element, Caf\u00e9 ArtScience also functions as a proper restaurant. Sharing its Kendall Square neighborhood with satellite offices for Google, Microsoft, and Akamai Technologies, it draws in Boston\u2019s technology Brahmin, as well as professors from MIT and Harvard, which are a few miles away. The chef, Patrick Campbell, who came on board from Boston\u2019s Eastern Standard, makes contemporary French fare such as Nantucket Bay scallops in a salt cod velout\u00e9. Only rarely does he use Edwards\u2019s inventions in his kitchen, but he\u2019s begun playing around; eventually, he says, he wants Le\u00a0Whaf to lend complementary tastes to certain dishes. Maul, the cocktail maestro, has experimented a bit more. When Edwards hired him in November, he was already well known for using centrifuges, vaporizers, and other lab equipment at Boston\u2019s Clio restaurant.", "Molecular gastronomy has been a culinary gimmick since at least the mid-1990s, as chefs including Ferran Adria (Madrid), Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (Washington), Grant Achatz (Chicago), and Wylie Dufresne (New York) began cooking with butane burners, dehydrators, hot-infusion siphons, and other tools that were once meant for chemistry labs. As the cuisine has gone in and out of style in the past two decades, scientists themselves have started trying to revolutionize the way we consume food. Soylent, for instance, reduces meals to a $4 nutritional shake to save time and money. Beyond Meat, an upstart making fake chicken strips from plant protein, has recently received an investment from Bill Gates. This year about a half-dozen other companies have tried to fine-tune new forms of ingesting melatonin and insulin.", "Few have aimed to capture the sensorial experience of food\u2014what Edwards calls the \u201chead experience\u201d\u2014while cutting out the actual eating and drinking. \u201cYour first adopters are going to be a certain kind of people,\u201d he says from a dining room that\u2019s stark white, with exposed ceiling pipes, marble tabletops, moss-green velvet banquettes, and honeycomb-shaped light fixtures. \u201cThis aesthetic is designed to make them feel welcome.\u201d One frequent customer is Tim Rowe, founder of the Cambridge Innovation Center, who says the restaurant works because the science part is approachable. \u201cIt\u2019s not this highbrow food as chemistry,\u201d he adds. Edwards says Caf\u00e9 ArtScience brings in $10,000 to $15,000 a day\u2014the average entr\u00e9e is $22\u2014and he\u2019s on track to pay back its five outside investors in two years. Prime dinner reservations have been tough to get since it opened.", "People haven\u2019t always responded so warmly to Edwards\u2019s work. In 2010 he was interviewed on a French TV show about his edible bottles, made from a natural membrane held together by electrostatic forces. The pear-shaped product was still in its nascent phase; you bit the top off to drink from it. When he arrived on the set, Edwards was groggy with jet lag, having just flown into Paris, his second home, from Cambridge. A curtain pulled open to reveal 10\u00a0volunteers, who burst into uncomfortable laughter while handling the jiggling bottle. \u201cDoing something in the lab is one thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to bring those innovations immediately into a mass-market setting.\u201d", "After that, he realized the need to test his products on potential customers. So in 2007 he opened Le Laboratoire in Paris, which functions as a gallery and retail space. Caf\u00e9 ArtScience is an extension of that\u2014Edwards was originally courted to set up shop in Cambridge by BioMed Realty, a life-science real estate company that was looking to keep its building buzzing at night. Next door to the restaurant, Edwards brokered a lease for a gallery, which has become a U.S. version of Le Labo. He rents it out occasionally for events but mostly uses it to stage free scientific exhibitions. The inaugural show, open through March, features works by MIT Media Lab\u2019s Neri Oxman and Tod Machover, who explore how hearing familiar voices influences mental and physical health.", "Edwards, 53, doesn\u2019t need these businesses to make much money. One of his projects already made him rich. In 1997, working with MIT professor Robert Langer, he developed a whiffle-ball-like particle that could carry insulin to the lungs, potentially allowing diabetics to avoid annoying injections. In 1999 their startup, Advanced Inhalation Research, was bought by the biopharmaceutical company Alkermes for $114\u00a0million in stock. After that, \u201cinvestors and bankers cared a lot more about what I was saying than any audience that had ever listened to me in my academic days,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cPeople were truly betting on [my] ideas.\u201d", "Ultimately, the inhalable insulin concept didn\u2019t pan out. By the time it passed pharmaceutical trials, it was so costly to administer that health insurers wouldn\u2019t cover it. This soured Edwards\u2019s interest in medicine. \u201cHaving to go through regulatory bodies and major corporations before people can actually use this stuff is a big liability,\u201d he says.", "He began focusing instead on less-regulated substances, such as vitamins and food. Even so, his inventions haven\u2019t always passed muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 2012 the agency claimed that his Aeroshot caffeine inhaler was misbranded as a dietary supplement. By definition, the FDA charged, a dietary supplement had to be ingested, not inhaled. The product is still sold, though it\u2019s now described as an \u201cair-based nutritional supplement.\u201d", "Eventually, after items like the Aeroshot are critiqued by diners at Caf\u00e9 ArtScience, Edwards hopes more supermarkets and food emporiums will start stocking them. This summer a line of coconut milk WikiPearls (free of dairy and other potential allergens) will hit shelves at Dave\u2019s Fresh Marketplace, an independent chain of New England grocery stores.", "Edwards is also tinkering with noningestible toys. The latest, called the oPhone, is a joint creation with a former student, 24-year-old Rachel Field, that lets users tag messages with scents and send them around the Web. Like Proust with his famous madeleine, Edwards wants to explore the link between aroma and memory\u2014he thinks it could have value in the field of virtual reality. The $149 device, which will start shipping in April, includes various scented chips that when heated send brief whiffs of roses or brown sugar through a handset. The team is also developing an oBook, a children\u2019s storybook app connected to an odor-emitting oPhone, to update \u201980s scratch-and-sniff technology.", "Of course, there\u2019s an oPhone to test out at Caf\u00e9 ArtScience. There, you use it to smell coffee beans from the premium French roaster Coutume before ordering an espresso drink. It\u2019s not perfect yet. The first \u201caroma tweet,\u201d sent last June, was supposed to call to mind Champagne and macarons, but it smelled more like a Hershey\u2019s bar.

And I found only a couple of dishes to be more good-looking than they were good-tasting,\u00a0such as the very\u00a0crunchy root vegetables around a sticky cured egg. Not so with\u00a0the intensely flavored fruit leather of black garlic, fermented until soft and sweet, then folded like a paper fan. It was stunning to look at, a little slick and greasy, but with a flavor that went on and on.\u00a0", "When reservations opened for the\u00a0pop-up last summer, the fact that dinner for two with wine cost about the same as a flight from New York to Tokyo ($1,350) did nothing to hinder interest, and the books filled up almost immediately. For fans and regulars, and the people who travel across the world for dinner every time Redzepi trims his beard, this menu is loaded with references to dishes served in Copenhagen. The fermented mushroom, a chewy\u00a0chocolate-coated candy, may look familiar. Variations on the shrimp on ice are something of a trademark.", "Skeptics often think of Noma, or\u00a0the brand of fine dining it has inspired, as a kind of culinary con\u2014cooks pulling bitter, bad-tasting weeds from the ground and tricking so many rich people into eating them. But Redzepi, who has now been running Noma for about 15 years, produces deeply intelligent, thoughtful menus that are\u00a0full of deliciousness.\u00a0And when there\u2019s a challenge, it rewards in unexpected ways. Take the caramel-colored scallop cloud. No, it\u2019s not particularly photogenic, and the smell is, if we\u2019re being polite, powerfully fishy. It's borderline stinky, like what Gollum might use as an air freshener. But as I eat it, I become obsessed with it: light in texture, heavy with flavor, sticking to the roof of my mouth with the sweet insistence of peanut butter. Dried for two days, then aerated, it reminds me how much technique is quietly at work behind the scenes\u2014not to distract or show off, but to focus and intensify, to get you even closer so\u00a0you taste the thing more clearly.", "To serve a 15-course menu twice a day from Jan. 9 to Feb. 14, Redzepi and his research team traveled all over the country to research local ingredients and meet purveyors, then relocated Noma\u2019s team of more than\u00a060 cooks and servers to live and work at the Mandarin Oriental. It was an exercise in applying a long-honed ethos in an entirely new environment, an experiment. A few of the resulting dishes were obscenely good one week in, and the ones I couldn\u2019t get out of my head respectfully expanded on Japanese technique and tradition, such as\u00a0exquisite fresh tofu under\u00a0a snow of pale walnuts and yuzu zest. Alone, it was something\u2014bare and sweet and clean\u2014but at the bottom of the bowl was a thick umami-rich sauce that seemed to heighten and refresh and complicate everything. It was essentially perfect, and at the time I wondered, why didn\u2019t Redzepi start the meal with something easier than that shrimp? Something like this?", "When the wild duck arrived, presented first whole with its head lolling, then carved with its head split in half, its brains still in the hollow, I knew why. In places the skin was chewy, in others soft. Some meat was livery and rich with blood, other parts tough, grainy, windpipe-y, kinky\u00a0with bone and cartilage. Alongside\u00a0the most conventionally pretty, sought-after parts was\u00a0an invitation to get to know\u00a0the\u00a0whole bird.\u00a0", "That's because Redzepi doesn\u2019t deal in the sort of squishy, coddling fine dining that sedates you like a massage. Noma wants to delight, and it does, but the kitchen\u00a0often seems more interested in letting you find your own way to pleasure and in pointing out the places where beautiful and ugly blur. Noma may be on the 37th\u00a0floor of a hotel in Tokyo for\u00a0now, but it brings the natural world in so close, you can taste it. You can almost feel it wriggle."]},

The whole thing is finished by hand to the same specifications as Richard Mille\u2019s watch movements.\u00a0", "The mechanical system itself is based on that of a minute repeater. You hit the button, and a system of gears and springs slowly transfers energy at a constant rate to send the nib sliding out of the front of the barrel. Instead of giving it\u00a0an external winding system that would require a small bit of human labor, Richard Mille engineered the winding mechanism into the barrel of the pen itself;\u00a0putting the cap on sends the nib back into its home, generating enough energy for the next deployment. It\u2019s a deceivingly complex solution to a difficult problem you\u2019ve never thought about.", "I didn\u2019t get a chance to write with the pen, but I did give the mechanism a whirl during a short demo. The pen is heavy in the hand, even with the carbon exterior, but it\u2019s weighted nicely and doesn\u2019t feel like it would be uncomfortable to write with if you like larger pens.

Most watches today advance three or four times per second, getting you the little ticks you hear if you put the watch up to your ear.", "Only a handful of watch brands, most notably Omega, don't use this basic mechanism in their watches.

There's still a wheel, but it swings only 16 degrees instead of 300\u2014and does so 16 times per second instead of four. The increase in frequency means you get much higher accuracy than with a traditional balance, and the low amplitude conserves power (there's a lot less motion happening overall, meaning less power is used).

First the huge piece of pink sapphire has to be created in a lab with sufficient\u00a0purity and clarity to allow the light to shine through without inclusions. Then it takes almost 40 days for CNC machines to mill the case shape out of\u00a0the block. If something goes wrong, the whole thing will crack or shatter and must then be thrown away.

Say what you will about Mille's choice aesthetic, his engineering is downright brilliant. The titanium screws used to hold the case together are a special design that reduces the torque involved in sealing the case parts together, which keeps the sapphire from cracking and ensures a tight seal. The balance spring in the movement is also free-sprung, and a watchmaker can adjust its weight distribution to get super-accurate performance, plus the winding rotor can be fine-tuned for the right amount of force.

While I'm not sure I agree with Piaget's marketing department in describing this watch as elegant or black-tie appropriate, it's certainly striking and handsome.", "But the movement is what really matters here. First, a refresher on exactly how a mechanical watch usually works. A standard mechanical watch feeds power from a tightly coiled mainspring (the thing you wind by hand) through to a balance wheel, which swings back and forth three or four\u00a0times per second, counting out the time. That wheel moves a little fork back and forth, and with each tick and tock, a gear is turned. That gear then turns other gears, and you get hours, minutes, seconds, and whatever other units of time are tracked all from those little movements. That wheel-fork system is called a regulator, and it's what allows a watch to keep time.", "Here, Piaget has kept the mechanical spring as the power source and is still using gears to implement the timekeeping, but the mechanism actually keeping the time is a quartz crystal (like what you'd find in, say, a Swatch). What makes it different from a lesser quartz watch, though, is that instead of a little circuit board telling the first hand\u00a0to move once per second, the quartz crystal regulates the movement of a spinning flywheel, which in turn controls all those other gears. The crystal oscillates at 32,768 Hz vs. the 3 or 4 Hz you get from a traditional watch.

While Piaget might not be first to the party here, it does seem like a development that makes sense, not simply a bid for customer attention.", "To make sure you don't miss anything, Piaget placed both the winding rotor for the mechanical spring and the regulating wheel front and center on the dial. It actually took me a second to find the hands the first time I looked at the 700P (they're down to the right, FYI). The movement is also blackened and skeletonized with polished gears, another way to make sure no one mistakes this for a cheap quartz knock-off.", "Piaget has not yet announced a price for this watch, and it really could be anything. It's hard to predict what the R&D costs are to develop technology such as\u00a0this, especially since only 118 pieces are being made, so we'll have to wait for SIHH in January to see just how expensive\u00a0this watch is going to be.

So Omega was asked to come up with a successor\u00a0and what we got was the strange X-33.\u00a0", "First, the X-33 is an electronic quartz watch, making it more accurate than a mechanical watch. The 41mm case is made from titanium to reduce weight and increase strength, and the dial is a hybrid of analog and digital displays. The basic time display still uses hands but the chronograph and alarm functions utilize the LCD screen to simplify the dial. The crown also adjusts functions with a series of presses, which is supposed to make it easier to use with space gear on. In addition to being used by astronauts and cosmonauts, the X-33 was often issued to military test pilots as well.", "Zalyotin was given this particular X-33 by the Russian Federal Space Agency in 2000 and he wore it that year on a mission to the Mir space station as well as on later missions to the International Space Station. According to Christie's, this is the only wristwatch to have ever been worn on both space stations. The watch is being sold by a collector who purchased it directly\u00a0from Zalyotin and included with the box, papers, and accessories are two signed photographs of the cosmonaut himself.", "It's been a big year for space-worn watches selling publicly. Usually, because the watches worn by astronauts, cosmonauts, and other space travelers are\u00a0equipment issued by space agencies, they remain in government hands forever.

While the watches have contained a few different features over the years (date, temperature gauge, day of the week), the formula has always been pretty consistent. So the question for collectors has always been, \"what comes next?\" The answer is a dive watch.", "The Type 5 starts with the same basic formula as Types 1 and 3 but adds\u00a0some new features specific to diving. The 46 mm titanium case has a prominent silver-colored bezel around the main timekeeping dials, where the date indicator would be on the Type 3. It has grooves protruding from it between each of the 10-minute markers, letting you turn the bezel to time your dive (just as\u00a0you would with ", "). Crucially, it's not sealed inside the oil-filled compartment with the other discs, so it operates independently of the timekeep mechanism itself, and it's unidirectional, meaning you can't\u00a0accidentally give yourself more underwater time than you have air for.", "The dial itself contains a few indicators, all nested as with previous Ressence watches. The main hour dial now has big bubbly numerals at the 3, 6, and 9, making it a little easier to read quickly. What looks like the seconds dial is actually a \"runner,\" a requirement for the watch to meet international diving watch standards (", "). This one makes a rotation every 90 seconds, not every 60, and functions as a shock absorber for the oil inside the watch too. Finally, an indicator for the temperature of the oil sits between the sapphire crystal and those discs (giving them that seamless appearance). On the Type 3, that indicator was mostly for fun, but here it's critical, as on deeper or colder dives\u00a0the oil could cool off, gumming up the works.", "While a diving watch might not seem like the most logical direction for Ressence (I was pretty surprised when I saw\u00a0a prototype a few weeks ago), there's a major benefit to a watch like this under water: Because the oil projects the markers up to the crystal's surface, you can view the time perfectly from every angle. There's no space between the crystal and the hands to create distortion or reflection, and the watch looks exactly the same in or out of water. There is a lock on the side of the case, too, preventing you from twisting the case to manipulate the time under water. That Ressence chose to make this an actual ISO-caliber diver (it's currently undergoing external certification) instead of just a \"diving-inspired\" watch, which is to be applauded.", "The Type 5 isn't going to appeal to everyone who loved Ressence's earlier watches, though. While those have a restrained, minimalist aesthetic, this watch is a little more brash. The black and white are punctuated by bright green, blue, and red, the numerals are on the funky side, and the overall look is much bolder. These aren't bad things, necessarily. Rather than just create another extension of the Type 1/Type 3 families, founder\u00a0Beno\u00eet Mintiens has made something genuinely new that might bring some new customers into the fold who found the previous models a little too austere. From early photos, I didn't think I would like the watch nearly as much\u00a0as I did in person. It's new and different, but still very Ressence.", "The Ressence Type 5 is priced at $35,800, putting it between the Type 1 and Type 3 in the lineup.

After a few more chance encounters with Wellington between Melbourne and Cairns, Tysander became obsessed with the military-inflected accessory. So much so that he went home to Uppsala, Sweden, and built a whole company on the idea, naming it after the stranger who inspired him.", ", or DW as the company is often abbreviated, makes watches that are both instantly recognizable and so generic they verge on invisible. They come with polished-steel or rose-gold-colored cases, in five sizes from a diminutive 26-millimeter to a medium-large 40mm. The dials are all white, with slim lines marking each hour and hands just wide enough to be legible. The only thing that noticeably sets DWs apart from each other is the strap, which comes in a half-dozen colorful nylons and a few leather options, none flashy enough to mar the luxurious look. With a watch, you often pay extra for minimalism\u2014think A. Lange & S\u00f6hne or Piaget\u2014but DWs are cheap, running from $149 to $299.", "\u201cOur watches are inspired by the upper echelons of the watch world but at a very accessible price point,\u201d says Frans Sjo, business manager for the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that we want everyone to be able to own a Daniel Wellington.\u201d Four years ago, Tysander invested $15,000 to start the company. In 2014 it sold more than a million timepieces and took in $70\u00a0million. This year, Tysander projects $220\u00a0million in revenue. By comparison, Rolex, which sells $5,000-plus watches, and Tag Heuer, which focuses on $1,000 ones, consider it a good year if they sell a million units.", "Which means that, right now at least, it\u2019s good business to sell very expensive watches\u2014or very cheap ones. DW competes with countless other brands in the $100 to $500 sector, including the Bauhaus-style Mondaine and the more military-looking Tsovet. But, in the same way that brightly colored plastic Swatches dominated the 1980s and utilitarian Fossils took off in the \u201990s, Daniel Wellingtons own the current decade. \u201cOften a designer watch whose core reason to exist is that it is fashionable this season is probably no longer viable next season,\u201d says Steve Bock, former president of Fossil and current president of Bedrock Manufacturing, the parent company of\u00a0Shinola watches.", "Beyond getting the styling right, Tysander picked a good moment to build a watch brand. After dipping during the financial crisis, the industry has grown every year since. About 40\u00a0million analog quartz watches were sold in 2014 in the U.S. alone, up from about 33\u00a0million in 2009, according to market researcher Euromonitor. Corresponding revenue rose by an even larger rate, jumping from\u00a0$3.7\u00a0billon to $5\u00a0billion. And even though the Apple Watch\u2014which sold 1.5\u00a0million timepieces in only a week\u2014might have looked like a deadly threat to traditional watchmakers such as Daniel Wellington, sales have since dropped as much as 90\u00a0percent, says a recent report by Slice Intelligence, an analytics firm in Palo Alto. Two-thirds of the Apple Watches sold were the cheaper $349 Sport model.", "When Tysander, 30, started his company in 2009, he also was running an online necktie store with his brother and producing a line of plastic Rolex look-alikes. The Chinese factory he worked with on the watches happened to also make nylon bands, so he began thinking about what kind of face might look handsome paired with them. \u201cI designed a thinner case and added some color to go with the preppy trend going on at the time,\u201d he says. The first Daniel Wellington was 40mm and rose-gold, and it came with one of four bright nylon straps.", "In person, Tysander bears a striking resemblance to the watches he\u2019s created. He\u2019s slim, with that particular color of shockingly blond hair that seems to exist only in Sweden. On the day we met, he was in a streamlined navy suit. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges in the beginning was that it was just me, no co-founders,\u201d he says. At first, he recruited classmates from Uppsala University to help. Now his team has more than 100\u00a0people throughout five offices, in Los Angeles, New\u00a0York, Stockholm, Hong\u00a0Kong, and Shenzhen, China. Only recently has he started adding senior staff, including a chief executive officer, Roger\u00a0Kylberg, who used to run a popular Swedish children\u2019s clothing brand.", "Although DW bills itself as a Swedish company, the watches are manufactured in China, which is how the company keeps prices so low. The internal quartz movements\u2014a battery and vibrating crystal to keep the time, essentially\u2014come from Miyota, a Japanese supplier popular with lower-price brands, because their products are reliable and they always have a massive inventory. The rest of the components are made and assembled in Shenzhen, a manufacturing hub.", "The distribution is similarly international. At first, Tysander began selling the watch online in Sweden and through local storefronts. A year later he came to New York to find American partners, and now the watches are carried in major department stores such as Bloomingdale\u2019s and Nordstrom, as well as at niche fashion boutiques including Haberdash in Chicago and Lizard Lounge in Portland, Ore. Soon after, the DW team began attending Baselworld, the industry\u2019s largest trade show, held each spring in Switzerland. Unlike other brands that aim to stay exclusive by not selling to any old shop, DW will distribute to most retailers that want its product. There are now more than 5,800 partners worldwide, in places as far-flung as Kazakhstan, the Faroe Islands, and Andorra. Tysander says he wants to expand into places such as Africa that are underserved by the watch market.", "The company also has a habit of giving its product away for free, specifically to social-media stars and prominent personalities. Tysander refuses to pay for traditional advertising, instead working with thousands of bloggers, celebrities, and other \u201cinfluencers\u201d worldwide. One of them, Blake Scott, 27, has been collaborating with Daniel Wellington for a little more than a year, sharing the watches with his 318,000 Instagram followers. \u201cI first found out about Daniel Wellington via Instagram: Everyone outside the States was wearing one, and it seemed so cool,\u201d he says. Soon after, someone from the brand reached out and said he wanted to give Scott a couple of watches to post on his feed. Eventually he negotiated a deal with the company, which paid a few hundred dollars for a multiweek campaign.", "By being so blatant on social media, Daniel Wellington\u2019s Instagram account has gained more than a million followers, almost quadruple that of competitors MVMT (238,000) and Fossil (236,000). Traditionally, watch brands have avoided using social media, so Daniel Wellington has filled the void for online watch content.", "But a plain watch gets boring after a while. So, in April, Tysander announced Daniel Wellington\u2019s latest style, the Dapper, its most complicated watch yet. And, at $299, its most expensive. It has black Roman numerals, instead of the typical stick markers, and a date window, a first for the brand. Instead of gold, the hands gleam metallic blue. And, in the gravest departure yet, the company suggests wearing it not with a NATO strap but a more sophisticated leather band."]},

Skagen salad is funnily enough almost completely unknown in Denmark, whereas in Sweden it has remained one of the most popular starters (appetizers) altogether. Often served on slices of white bread fried in butter and topped with Bleak Roe in a dish called Toast Skagen. Today skagenr\u00f6ra loosely refers to any creamy salad made from something that could possibly be red shellfish. Some of these salads are great and others are awful. The original contains shrimp, mayonnaise and dill (according to some accounts with the addition of a bit of grated horseradish). The worst more recent addition is onion \u2013 red or any other kind. It makes the delicate dilly mix smell to me like standing in a dirty second-hand clothes store, a bit like sweat aged on synthetic fibres from the 1960s. Don\u2019t add onion to your Skagen salad. Also it contains absolutely no dairy products. Many modern recipes contain cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and they are wrong. It will only result in a sour taste and a too liquid salad.", "If you have made a great mayo it will be acidic enough and you won\u2019t feel that the salad lacks in acidity. This is important as adding liquids like vinegar or lemon will make it too wet. Serve the salad with a wedge of lemon on the side.", "Coarsely chop half the shrimp (baby shrimp) tails and place them in a bowl with the remaining whole shrimp tails. Add enough mayo to properly coat all of the shrimp and make the mix creamy. Be careful though not to add too much as this will turn everything into more of a sauce, which is not the idea.

The seal is water resistant, and I didn't once worry about it coming off accidentally. The Chronos comes with an charging pad and should get about 36 hours of juice on a three-hour charge.

Already domed\u00a0or curved backs end up looking and feeling extra bubble-like with this on the back. Metal bracelets need to be adjusted to accommodate the extra girth. This\u00a0won't\u00a0be a huge deal if you wear the Chronos every day, but it would quickly get annoying for an occasional wearer.", "The Chronos app is straightforward and the set-up process really easy. It prompts you to pair with the device and pulls in your health data from iOS's HealthKit. Steps, distance, active calories burned, and flights of stairs\u00a0climbed are the main categories, and the interface is clean and easy to read, showing activity across the day in a ring.\u00a0There will be some proprietary fitness tracking down the line, but for now it works seamlessly with Apple's native Heath app.\u00a0Everything stays synched between the two, so you can also pass the Chronos data to other HealthKit compliant apps for such things as\u00a0weight loss or particular kinds of athletic training.\u00a0", "The other big function of Chronos is notifications. Chronos has really dug deep into iOS to make sure the experience is as rich as possible, and it has\u00a0done a great job. Each type of notification can be assigned one of eight vibration patterns and one of six colors of LED flashes (or no lights at all).\u00a0There are two tiers of notifications: person-specific and app-specific. For the former, you can assign a contact\u00a0her\u00a0own combination and get that vibration and flash whenever she\u00a0contacts you, whether it's through a phone call, an e-mail, or a WhatsApp message. Apps can also get their own patterns, which will be the default unless a contact has a special pattern assigned. The breadth of natively integrated apps is great,\u00a0including Facebook, Snapchat, and\u00a0Twitter all from launch.", "There are also\u00a0options for turning on gesture controls, letting you use the Chronos as a basic remote. Tapping your watch in different patterns lets you silence calls, skip music tracks, and activate your phone's\u00a0camera remotely. These aren't things I find terribly compelling on most smart watches, and it's no different with the Chronos.\u00a0These commands\u00a0are still just way easier to do on your phone than with a strange series of taps.", "Wearing the Chronos around, I found the notifications extremely useful. Simple things such as\u00a0calendar alerts and message notifications are where smartwatches shine right now, and I liked that with Chronos, it was my wrist buzzing instead of my phone. I did, however, keep the LEDs off most of the time, since I got quite a few strange glances from\u00a0friends at a bar one night when a text from a late arriver initiated a wrist-disco. While a true smartwatch such as\u00a0the ", " or ", "\u00a0often seems to be crying out for attention, the Chronos disappears except when it's giving you that nudge to grab your phone.\u00a0", "For a lot of mechanical watch wearers, smartwatches have been a nonstarter so far, and most fitness trackers don't do a very good job with notifications and other nonfitness things. The Chronos offers watch lovers a lot of functionality in a slim package that won't interfere with the baubles they're already strapping to their wrists.", "The Chronos is currently available for preorder via ", "\u00a0for $99. The product will start being delivered to customers in spring 2016, when Chronos will also become available for general sale at $129.

For a brand with such a storied military and tool watch history, plus such incredible modern technology, Breitling often manages to pigeonhole itself into making what look like oversized fashion watches.

A so-called \"deadbeat seconds\" complication mimics that quartz-like ticking by storing up those multiple swings and then sending energy to the second hand in discrete bursts on each actual second, creating the same precise ticks on the dial. People who don't know much about watches might look at your wrist and assume there's a battery lurking in there somewhere, but you don't care about impressing those people anyway.", "The large central second hand on the ", " is the perfect palette to show off this esoteric complication.

Vacheron Constantin was founded in 1755, making it the oldest continuously operating watch manufacturer in the world. It weathered the fall of European monarchies, a pair of world wars, and the watch industry's so-called \"Quartz Crisis\" of the 1970s and 80s\u2014and the brand's current custodians aren't going to let you forget it.\u00a0To celebrate\u00a0the company's 260th anniversary this year, Vacheron Constantin has unveiled the \"Harmony\" collection,\u00a0a group of cushion-shaped watches ranging from a simple dual-time number to a monster chronograph that sets a new world record.", "The particulars of this line of watches\u00a0vary, but the new cushion case shape is the Harmony line's signature. Designing a balanced cushion case is a delicate matter; if it's too round, it can look like a square watch that had a little too much fondue for dinner, but if it's too angular it appears rough and unfinished. The Harmony case really nails this balancing act, particularly with the short curved lugs and the proportion of the dial opening to the bezel width. At 42 millimeters across, the men's chronographs are a little large for my tastes, but the 40mm men's dual time and 37mm women's watches felt great on the wrist.", "There is a total of eight\u00a0watches in the collection: a monopusher split-seconds chronograph, a monopusher chronograph with a tourbillon, a monopusher chronograph with a pulsometric scale, a chronograph for women, and a trio of dual-time watches. I'll give you a second to take that all in. The four new movements used across the range are designed and manufactured entirely in-house and it took Vacheron seven years to develop them. The final watches all bear the Geneva Hallmark, meaning they meet rigorous quality and finishing standards, in addition to being made in the Canton of Geneva. These watches aren't messing around.", "My favorite of the bunch is actually\u00a0the simplest of the chronographs, the straightforward monopusher ($75,300, limited to 260 pieces). The pulsometer scale around the edge of the dial was used by doctors to measure patients' heart rates and is a favorite among vintage collectors. Sure, the other complications\u00a0might be more technically ambitious, but this is the one I want on my wrist right now. It's elegant, simple, and allows you to enjoy the new case shape and traditional dial layout without any distractions.", "The platinum Harmony Ultra-Thin Grande Complication split-seconds chronograph ($369,200, limited to 10 pieces) is the most ambitious of the collection. It's powered by the calibre 3500 movement, which, at only 5.2mm thick, is\u00a0the thinnest automatic split-seconds chronograph on the planet. Sure, that's shaving things pretty fine, but it's still an impressive feat. Watches such as this are usually manually wound so you can admire the mechanics through the caseback\u00a0(an automatic watch's\u00a0winding rotor usually\u00a0covers the movement) but the calibre 3500 uses a peripheral rotor to keep the view clear while providing the convenience of automatic winding. Incredible movement aside,\u00a0the watch is elegant, well-appointed, and looks a lot like the 1920s chronographs that inspired its creation.", "While the Harmony Tourbillon Chronograph ($314,600, limited to 26 pieces) is\u00a0technically wonderful, it fails to achieve the same aesthetic cohesiveness of the other\u00a0Harmony watches. The large tourbillon carriage is meant to add wow factor but\u00a0instead just looks oversized, and the 45-minute counter overlaps with the tourbillon aperture in a way that\u00a0misses the ", " mark. If you like tourbillons, you're probably drooling over the Harmony Tourbillon Chronograph already, but for me this watch is the least exciting of the bunch.", "The women's chronograph ($71,200, limited to 260 pieces) is not a monopusher, using the more traditional two-button layout. While it doesn't have\u00a0an entirely new movement inside, the caliber 1142 is an enhanced version of an existing Vacheron movement that now has the Geneva Hallmark certification and a slightly faster 3 Hz balance wheel.\u00a0The 37mm size is perfect for this case shape, and my only gripe is that there isn't a version without diamonds that I could wear myself.", "Rounding out the collection are the three\u00a0dual-time Harmonies, two for men ($43,800, limited to 625 pieces each in rose and white gold) and one for women ($50,600, limited to 500 pieces). These are the simplest of the Harmony watches, but they are extremely practical and a nice alternative if you're not a chronograph person. Again, women don't get an option without a diamond bezel, which is a bit of a shame,\u00a0though the diamond model might be the most competitively priced watch here.", "Overall, the Harmony collection is an impressive effort from Vacheron Constantin and it will be exciting to watch the range grow in non-limited editions over the coming years. Developing\u00a0three monopusher chronograph movements, one with split-seconds and one with a tourbillon, plus a dual-time movement, all while creating an entirely new case shape and accompanying design codes is a serious anniversary gambit. And, tourbillon aside, there is a real freshness and cohesion to the Harmony watches that makes them stand out in a sea of ultra-conservative dress watches.", "\u00a0"]},

When images of the S2 were first shown\u00a0a few weeks ago, people commented that the bubble-based menus were reminiscent of those on the Apple Watch, but short of there being circles involved, I noticed no meaningful similarities.", "For all the hand-wringing that happens about smartwatch battery life, charging it overnight seems pretty much requisite these days. Samsung says the S2 can go\u00a0two to three days on a single charge, but\u00a0we'll have to see how it performs in the wild. With a quote like this, though, you should be covered for at least that first full day. To charge the S2, you drop it into a special wireless charging cradle and the face switches into alarm clock mode.", "All the S2 models include onboard Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity, but there will also be a special edition announced at a later date with built-in 3G, too.", "The Gear S2 and Gear S2 Classic will go on sale in the U.S. sometime in early October, and wireless carriers will be announcing their own sale dates individually.\u00a0Samsung isn't offering any more information than that, including what the watches will cost.\u00a0For now, we just have to sit and wait."]},

Its little brother, the 2015\u00a0Moto G, is Motorola's fastest-selling smartphone ever, and the company is hoping the Moto X Style can keep pace. It's a big phone with a unique design, and it's packing a 21 megapixel camera that Motorola says is best in class. Even with top-of-the-line specs,\u00a0the price starts at $399, around half the price of competitors.", "So should you buy one?", "First things first: What is this phone actually called? After", "\u00a0a few weeks ago,\u00a0there was some confusion, because Motorola opted to split the Moto X into two separate lines and even gave a single phone two names. First there's the\u00a0Moto X Play, a 5.5-inch, midrange phone that won't be sold in the U.S. Then there's\u00a0the Moto X Style, which is the phone we have here. It's being sold in the U.S. as the \"Moto X Pure Edition\" because it runs a nearly stock version of Android and won't be tied to any carriers, but it's essentially the exact same phone as the Moto X Style sold in other countries around the world.\u00a0", "With that out of the way, we can get into the phone itself.\u00a0On paper, it goes toe-to-toe with the best\u00a0phones from Samsung Electronics and LG. There's a 5.7-inch Quad HD display, a hexa-core processor, 3 GB of RAM, and a 21 megapixel camera. So far, so good.\u00a0I won't bore you with ", ", but\u00a0the only major omission is a fingerprint sensor, which Moto left off to keep the price down and the design clean. It means having to unlock the phone with a password or passcode and could cause some friction when Android Pay is launched, but I don't think it's a deal breaker by any means.\u00a0", "The design of the phone is definitely different from what the competitors are offering. Its screen stretches almost completely to the edges of its broad face, which means more real estate and less wasted space. The back is also curved across both axes, which helps keep the phone from naturally tipping back out of your hands. If you saw \"Moto\" and \"5.7 inches\" and instantly had fears of this phone being as unwieldy as the Motorola-made Google Nexus 6, I would understand. But after using the phone for the better part of a week, I haven't had any problems (even with my child-size hands).\u00a0", "Another big selling point for Motorola is the ", ", which lets you mix and match colors and finishes in an online tool and order the exact phone you want. Since this phone is being sold entirely unlocked without any carrier involvement, Moto can go directly to consumers like this (stock configurations of the Moto X Style will also be available from Best Buy and Amazon.com). You can select from a handful of rubber silicone, wood, and leather backs, a white or black front panel, and different metallic accent colors, along with a few small software customizations and engraving, too. In a world where most phones are predominantly a single color, and most often\u00a0some combination of silver and black or white, a little variety is a nice way to get customers' attention.", "The phone starts at $399 with 16 GB of storage and a rubber silicone back. This is a bit more than\u00a0half the starting price of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 (from $696) and Apple iPhone 6 Plus (from $749). For an additional $25, you can upgrade to one of the wood or leather backs, and you can bump storage up to either 32 GB or 64 GB for $50 and $100, respectively. Totally maxed out, the phone would set you back $524.\u00a0The premium backs are nice (especially the bamboo and saffiano leather), but my favorites are the basic-colored rubber ones, which are textured and\u00a0make the phone a little easier to hold. And since the Moto X Style accepts microSD cards up to 128 GB for addition storage, the imperative to horde gigabytes evaporates. For the vast majority of customers, the $399 Moto X Style is the one to get.", "At the end of the day, three things matter most on any smartphone: the camera, performance, and battery life. The Moto X Style scores well in all three categories.\u00a0", "For most people, their smartphone is their primary camera. So if you're going to be capturing memories of romantic dinners, special trips, or your family, you want to know that you're not going to end up with blurry, subpar shots. A bad camera is a great reason to pass on a phone these days, even if everything else is amazing. In the past, Moto's cameras have left a lot to be desired, but for the Moto X Style, the company claims \"best in class\" performance, and it's\u00a0not far off. In daylight, the camera (which you can open by twisting the phone twice) focuses quickly and has accurate color representation, and the shutter speed is fast enough that you don't get any blur. Both hardware and software are great here. As the light dims, though, some troubles did emerge. I occasionally found the camera hunting for focus, and blacks were full of noise. The camera is still toward the top of the pile, but I do have to give the edge to Samsung's latest crop of Galaxy phones.\u00a0", "Overall performance was great. Menus were snappy, apps opened quickly, and the only time I found myself staring at the screen impatiently waiting for something to happen was when the phone was booting up. The Snapdragon 808 processor and abundant RAM deliver, though they do make the phone run warm if you've got a lot of apps open at once\u00a0or are playing a game. Moto adds only a few things on top of Google's stock operating system, which both improves speed and means you should get software updates much faster. The voice assist and quick notifications features can be toggled in a dedicated app, and I find them generally helpful.\u00a0One small hiccup I found was a\u00a0problem\u00a0getting my unit to connect to Bluetooth headphones, an annoyance amplified by the awkwardly placed headphone jack at the top center. Otherwise, everything was smooth sailing.", "If your battery is dead, your phone is useless. It's that simple. I didn't have a single day using the Moto X Style when I ran out of juice before getting home for the night. Even when shooting the video review above, I got nearly six hours with the screen on the entire time. When you do run low, though, Moto has added a feature called Turbo Charging, which it claims is the fastest phone charging technology on the market right now. Bold claim aside, just 10\u00a0minutes plugged into the special adaptor, and I could get between five and 10\u00a0more hours of use.\u00a0Since battery capacity is a problem, that's not going away soon, and solutions like this become more and more important.", "There's no shortage of good Android phones right now. For the first time I can remember, it might be hard to choose which high-end handset to go for. But even in the crowded marketplace, the\u00a0Moto X Style sets itself apart by giving users\u00a0exactly\u00a0what they want\u2014a big screen, a sharp camera, and\u00a0an all-day battery. Even if it's not the absolute top performer in every category, it's a well-rounded device that will serve most people very well. Add the personalization options, the much lower price, and the easy of ordering one without involving your carrier, and the Moto X Style starts to look even more attractive.\u00a0", "Customers and competitors should both being paying attention."]},

This is the stuff of ", " covers and Calvin Klein\u00a0billboards. While it's not a complete camera on its own, ", " digital back is an attachment that turns\u00a0vintage cameras and lenses into high-resolution digital cameras that compete with ", ".", "For the non-nerds among us, it's worth noting what medium- and large-format photography are.", "In the good old days of film, most people shot 35mm. The name \"35mm\" is actually a misnomer, referring to the 36mm-long edge of a single frame on a negative. If you ever loaded a little canister of Kodachrome or Velvia into the back of a camera, this is what you were shooting. Medium-format was a larger 60mm square or 90mm x 60mm rectangle, while large-format films could be more than\u00a0100mm on the longest edge. It's a slight oversimplifications, but the bigger the negative, the higher the resolution; this is the same reason why IMAX shoots on larger film than standard\u00a0movies.\u00a0", "Hasselblad's best-known cameras from the 20th century shot in the 90mm x 60mm medium format, but since most pros are shooting digital these days, a lot of great cameras have been sitting\u00a0dormant for years.\u00a0The CFV-50C solves that problem.\u00a0", "While Hasselblad has made digital medium-format cameras for a few years now, these new cameras have been their own systems of lenses, bodies, and backs that were unable to interface easily with older equipment. The 50C is a digital back designed with older film cameras in mind, and it can replace the analog film magazine on the back of almost any medium-format Hasselblad going back to 1957. The finishes have even been matched to Hasselblad's older models, so in most cases onlookers\u00a0won't even be able to tell that this back is a later add-on to your vintage bodies and lenses.", "The heart of the 50C is a massive image sensor. It's 43.8mm x 32.9mm, meaning it has approximately 60 percent more surface area than the full-frame sensors found in top DSLRs,\u00a0such as\u00a0Canon's 5D, and it fits 50 megapixels into that space. Images come out with a 8,272\u00a0x 6,200\u00a0pixel total resolution and have 16-bit color depth. A single file can be more than 150 megabytes at top quality.", "This is all to say that you get big images with bright, accurate colors, and as you zoom in, more details will continue to reveal themselves.\u00a0", "\u00a0", "The raw specs put the 50C toward the top of the digital photography dog pile, so naturally, there's a\u00a0price tag to match.\u00a0", "The back alone will set you back $15,500, and even if you buy a modest vintage back and lens combo, you're likely running north of $20,000 just to get started. This isn't outlandish when it comes to digital medium- and large-format photography, but it makes the\u00a0", "\u00a0look like a downright bargain\u00a0by comparison.", "While the photos that come out of the 50C are the result of modern technology, the experience of shooting with it is almost entirely dictated by the camera to which you've attached it.\u00a0", "The only things you need to set on the 50C itself are ISO (it goes from 100 to 6,400) and what file format you want to shoot in (RAW, 8-bit TIFF, or both).", "The menus are really simple and easy to use. It's all buttons, no touch screen, and up/down and plus/minus buttons control almost everything.\u00a0When I first turned the 50C on, the menu actually seemed too simple. I expected more bells and whistles for $15,500, but I have to give it to Hasselblad for not cluttering things up for the sake of making the digital experience feel artificially expensive.", "The way to physically shoot a\u00a0camera like this is different, too.", "First off, the camera is heavy. Almost everything in the setup is metal and glass, and there are no ergonomic grips to help\u2014the back alone is about as heavy as a compact camera on its own, but then you're adding a large box and a hefty chunk of glass to the front, too. A neck strap would be a big help, though I went without during my trial. As with most Hasselblads, I needed to bend my\u00a0back a little bit to look down into the angled viewfinder on my test unit (a use case regardless of how tall you are), and it took\u00a0a little practice to get the hang of\u00a0the crank-shoot motion in a way that didn't\u00a0result in missing impromptu shots.\u00a0By the end of an hour or two, my arms and back were in desperate need of a break.", "While I enjoyed shooting this Hasselblad overall, the 50C is far from perfect. To keep the profile in line with that of a film magazine, Hasselblad opted for a bottom-mounted battery. It doesn't go in a chamber; it just clips to the bottom of the device. As a result it looks really unattractive, throws off the weight balance, and makes gripping the whole camera a little awkward (especially if you use large-capacity batteries).\u00a0", "Additionally, the screen is also much lower-quality than I want in a device of this caliber.", "Zooming in on images is slow, and it's almost impossible to tell whether you've nailed exposure and focus from the previews because they're too low resolution. I can understand and forgive\u00a0lag, since the images are big, but the inability to show a realistic preview of images\u00a0is tough to get past. Especially when you're shooting a totally manual camera with an antique metering system, you need to be able to accurately check your results in the field. For $15k, I'd expect\u00a0a better screen.\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Hardware might be fun, but what matters are the photographs, and that's where the 50C really delivers.\u00a0", "Once you pull the\u00a0images off the compact flash cards, you\u00a0need\u00a0to import them into Hasselblad's proprietary (free) Phocus software.\u00a0You can technically use\u00a0Adobe Lightroom, too, but I had much better results with Phocus. It's pretty standard photo editing software, optimized to handle the\u00a0proprietary file formatting\u00a0(color profile, size, etc.) coming out of the 50C.", "Playing around with the sliders and settings a little bit, you'll immediately notice just how much data are\u00a0crammed into these photographs. Zoom in, and you can get into the intricate textures of background objects. Adjust colors, and the changes are fluid without any\u00a0strange fringes and distortions. Even if you leave images as is, right out of the camera, color fidelity is great, lines are clean and sharp, and dynamic range is expansive.", "Comparing photos side by side on the Web is tough. You get the full effect only of what the 50C turns out when looking at and manipulating the full-size images. What you can do, however, is get a sense of just how far you can dive into a photo before you start losing detail. This is a photograph of a public art project in New York's Brooklyn Bridge Park, with bits of Manhattan in the background. It's been sampled down to 2,200 pixels wide from the original 8,272 pixels:", "If you keep the photograph at its full resolution and just pull out a 2,200-pixel-wide section, this is how far in you can dive without losing any quality. Just look at the level of detail in the building windows and the textures on metal and brick surfaces:", "And here are side-by-side crops of similar images taken with the 50C and with an iPhone 6 Plus. You'll see the image on the right is already degrading at this level of zoom, while plenty of flexibility is left in the image on the left. Sure, this is like saying a Lamborghini is faster than a Ford Focus, but since photos from the iPhone are what most people are most familiar with these days, I think it's worth getting a sense of the huge difference between the devices. (And of course your mileage will vary depending on the quality of your paired lens and body\u00a0as well.)", "I probably don't even have to say it, but a 50C-equipped Hasselblad isn't for everyone.", "If you mostly use your camera to grab snapshots of your kid's soccer games or to document your\u00a0vacation, you'll want something lighter, easier, and all-around less involved. There's also no question that $15,500 is a lot of money for something that's not even an entire camera unit, but rather just the image sensor and case.\u00a0", "But\u00a0if you're a serious hobbyist, make a living taking photographs, or have a bunch of vintage Hasselblad gear, you should definitely take a closer look at the CFV-50C.", "Even as someone who's shot a lot of the world's best cameras, both as a hobbyist and a writer, I was surprised by the images that came out of the 50C, both the sheer amount of detail they contained\u00a0and the quality of that detail.\u00a0If you're willing to put in the work, pay the price, and pair it with the right body and lenses, you'll be hard-pressed to create digital images better than what you can make with Hasselblad's 50C.\u00a0"]},

In most watches,\u00a0the tourbillon would be prominently displayed\u00a0on the dial, either in an asymmetrical section of the case or set deep into the dial.

As you tilt your wrist, though, the bevels and polished edges catch the light and the tourbillon lights up. It's a cool optical trick that lets you enjoy the complication when you want, while wearing a watch that will look unassuming to most.", "The dial is solid gold with a soft-grained silver finish. The indexes are not painted but engraved, and then filled with hard-fired enamel. The result is something that looks simple but is extremely hard to make\u2014a hallmark of this brand.

This is because Leica\u2019s digital cameras, until now, have been either point-and-shoots lacking a real Leica feel or fake-vintage rangefinders with a sensor in place of film. That changes today. The Leica Q combines the top-of-the-line look and feel the German optics experts are known for, with truly progressive technology that makes it easier to get great images out of the Q than any Leica before. This is a 21st-century Leica exactly as it should be.", "The Leica Q inhabits\u00a0a middle ground between Leica\u2019s consumer-focused compact cameras and its professionally minded M family of rangefinders. The former are mostly rebranded plastic Panasonic cameras meant for your pocket or backpack, while the latter have been the expensive gold standard for photojournalists for the better part of a century. The Q might be smaller and priced at less than\u00a0five-figures, but it has no clicky zoom lens.", "The foundations of the Q are a 24 megapixel full-frame sensor, the brand new Maestro II image processor, and a fixed (non-zoom) 28mm f/1.7 Summilux lens. Translation for all you non-camera nerds: The Q has top-of-the-line specs across the board.\u00a0The combination of large sensor and bright lens means the Q can achieve great color fidelity and resolution, and in exchange for the trade-off of not having interchangeable lenses, the lens/sensor combo can be designed specifically for one another to optimize performance.", "Practically, what this all means is that the Q is easy to use and produces gigantic image files that look great out of the camera. They can be processed ad nauseum, if that\u2019s your thing. If you open the lens up to the full aperture and crank up the ISO light-sensitivity settings (the Q goes to a crazy 50,000, though you\u2019ll want to keep it at 6,400 or lower), you can shoot anywhere that\u2019s lighter than pitch black and still get photos that don\u2019t look like a blurry sandbox. Colors are bright but not exaggerated, and people actually look like, well, people.", "The body and lens housing are all metal, which is nice in theory and makes the camera feel amazing when you first pick it up, but I found the weighting to be a little strange, and after a few hours my lilliputian wrists started to get a little tired. If you end up springing for a Q, you\u2019ll definitely want to grab one of the screw-on finger grips, too, as this fixed the problem and made the camera much more manageable.", "I\u2019ve shot various film and digital M rangefinders, and what shocked me most about the Q is just how much it can feel like shooting one of these cameras if you want it to.", "The biggest downside to Leica\u2019s M rangefinders for many is that they lack autofocus. When you want a visceral photography experience, this is great, and Ms are amazing cameras for pros and for taking long walks through unfamiliar cities, but just try getting a shot of your young kid at a party. The Q adds extremely fast and accurate autofocus, but not at the expense of the manual experience. You just release a lock, and the lens moves to M-style manual focus. The action is smooth, dense, and unlike any digital manual focus I\u2019ve ever used before. The viewfinder will magnify, show focus-peaking, or both, so you can really nail the shot. This is the first digital camera I\u2019ve actually enjoyed shooting with manual focus.", "There\u2019s also a macro mode, and when activated, the focusing scale on the lens itself changes to match. Both auto and manual focus work just the same in macro, and you can focus all the way down to 17cm (6.69 inches), which is really, really close. Shooting macro with a wide lens is a little strange, but it\u2019s a nice option to have, and I could see experimenting with this being a lot of fun.", "While the 28mm lens doesn\u2019t zoom and can\u2019t be swapped out, Leica added adjustable frame lines to the Q\u2019s viewfinder that mimic what you\u2019d find on an old film rangefinder. You fill the whole viewfinder to shoot with a 28mm field of view, but additional lines can be toggled to simulate 35mm and 50mm lenses, too. What you end up with are essentially just photographs cropped in from the beginning (if you\u2019re shooting both raw and jpg, the raw file stays the full 28mm while the jpg is cropped) to give you the experience of two other lenses. The images you get out of the Q are big enough that practically, these crops aren\u2019t problematic at all unless you\u2019re printing billboards. This feature might be my favorite thing about the camera.\u00a0", "I do have some gripes, though. The biggest is one that Leica fans have been complaining about since the company first got into digital cameras: The menus are so sparse and linear, it can be hard to find exactly what you\u2019re looking for. The settings are all there; it just takes some digging to get to what you need, which can be frustrating out in the field. And while you can navigate these menus and examine photos using the touch screen instead of the buttons, it\u2019s not nearly as responsive or dynamic as what you\u2019re used to on your smartphone. It\u2019s still better than what\u2019s on most cameras, but the lag and jitters can make the experience feel less than perfect. I mostly stuck to the old-fashioned buttons.", "At the $4,250\u00a0price, the Leica Q is expensive, no two ways about it.", "The most similar camera to the Q is Fuji\u2019s X100 T, another rangefinder-style compact with a fixed lens and manual controls, which retails for $1,299. While Fuji has mastered the electronic viewfinder, and the X100 T creates sharp, vivid images, the Leica optics and full-size sensor generate much more accurate, finely detailed photographs. Individual blades of grass are well separated and the sweat on a cold glass of beer looks like it might drip off the photo.", "Plus, the Q nails all the little experiences, such as\u00a0the feel of the focus ring, in a way that Fuji just can\u2019t touch (and I say this as someone who primarily shoots with Fuji cameras). At a little less than one-third the price of the Q and much smaller and lighter, however, it's easier to toss into a bag for a weekend away. For casual shooters, the X100 T will probably get a lot more use and perform just as well.", "The Leica Q is an incredible camera. That's not up for debate. It has a sharp lens, a high-fidelity image sensor, and a processor that lets it perform with almost no friction. Sturdy dials, a smooth focus ring, and a bright viewfinder simulate the experience of using a traditional film rangefinder, but lightning-fast autofocus makes sure you don\u2019t miss shots while fiddling with settings. Sure, it\u2019s pricey, but it\u2019s a Leica. It it were cheap, I\u2019d be suspicious.", "If you\u2019re looking for a camera that marries the authentic Leica experience with the modern conveniences most of us expect from a camera, and you\u2019re willing to pay for the best, you\u2019ll love the Q."]},

Naturally, I had to take a closer look (and listen).", "Devialet got its start in 2007 by engineering amplifiers for home audio systems that can sell for more than $30,000. Its calling card is a hybrid digital and analog amplification process that allows for high volumes without the distortion that usually comes with that territory. (Remember how your college roommate's boombox used to sound when he was blasting Nirvana? Yeah, it won't do that.)", "We don\u2019t need to get into all the gritty details of the proprietary amplification system, but suffice to say that Bernard Arnault, chief executive officer of LVMH, was impressed enough that he has invested more than $3 million in Devialet as part of its\u00a0", " funding round.", "The Phantom is Devialet\u2019s first self-contained system, meaning you don\u2019t need a collection of speakers, an amplifier, and a pile of other gear to actually hear your music\u2014the digital-to-analog converter (DAC), processor, amplifier, loud speakers, and connectivity are all inside. Just plug the Phantom in, connect your phone, computer, or other audio source to it via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, and you\u2019re good to go. Think the power of a multipiece setup with the convenience of something like a Jambox. Devialet has received 88 patents on the Phantom and at almost $2,000, it\u2019s the brand's most affordable product yet. (Affordable, of course, is relative.)", "The design is driven by the need for all the sound to originate at a single point at the center of the unit\u2014hermetically sealed by 1.2 tonnes of pressure\u2014and to radiate out from there. This lets the speakers sit very close together without interfering with one another. What we end up with is sort of a capsule shape with a glossy white surface and chrome accents.", "It\u2019s clearly well-made and a lot of care has been taken with the aesthetics, but if R2-D2 met the original iPod in a Left Bank nightclub, the Phantom might be the next-morning surprise. In other words, it's much more Euro-tech than I'd like. In theory the Phantom is portable, too, but at 25 lbs. it's not something you\u2019ll want to be carrying from room to room too often. Although it does come with a really nice felt case (like carrying a very stylish kettle bell) when the need strikes.", "Setting up the speaker is relatively straightforward. Plug it in (yes, at 750 watts it does have to be attached to a wall), turn it on, and pair it with your device over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. If using the latter, Devialet\u2019s proprietary Spark app (", " and ", ") acts as a bridge between the Phantom and your music, either saved or streamed through a limited selection of services such as Tidal. The app also gives you more detailed volume controls (levels 1-100) and lets you network multiple units together and control them independently from one dashboard, sort of like Sonos (more on that later).", "While I was able to test the app during a guided demo of the Phantom, my review unit was a prototype without Wi-Fi and thus I was unable to use Spark during my own tests. I really wish I'd had a chance to get to know the interface better as it's a critical part of the Phantom experience, and as it turns out, fairly necessary.", "For instance, if you don't use Spark and stream your music directly from Spotify or Google Play Music using your phone/music player, you only get the volume controls built into your device\u2014the only actual button on the unit is the power button. So in my tests I was limited to the dozen or so dots on my iPhone when adjusting the volume. On something this powerful, that lack of 1-to-100 fine-grained control is a problem. I often found myself struggling to keep the volume at a comfortable level in my studio apartment. Even on low settings it was too loud on some songs, and when it was too quiet, raising it one bar would sometimes make it overbearing.", "Goldilocksian ideals aside, high volumes are where the Phantom really shines. This is the speaker equivalent of a sports car revving to be let loose on country back\u00a0roads.", "As you crank the volume up to the maximum 99 decibels, the soundstage opens up and you really start to notice the clarity and separation between instruments. Bass shakes your chest\u2014the side woofer cones hypnotically blur along with the music (with 30 kilos of thrust force, according to Devialet's stats)\u2014and treble is powerful without being shrill. Low-end heavy music such as\u00a0SBTRKT and The Weeknd sounded boring on my headphones after using the Phantom. Listening to Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez, I could almost feel the guitar strings in my hand.", "I tested the Phantom both in a multi-thousand-square-foot loft in midtown Manhattan and on a large corporate terrace, and in both cases I was stunned by just how great the system sounded. The only thing missing was the party. If you want something for your living room or bedroom, the Phantom will likely be overkill (though it will still sound great).", "If you ask the people at Devialet, they'll tell you that they're competing with full home theater and dozen-component audiophile setups and not Bluetooth or networked speakers. While this may be true in some ways, there's no denying that the Phantom is looking to be a super-premium alternative to the likes of Sonos.", "For just a few hundred dollars you can get into either the Sonos system (starting at $199) or the Definitive Technology wireless speaker system (starting at $399), both of which will sound great in most spaces. But the bass is where the Phantom wins out. While I didn't test them head-to-head, without a $699 subwoofer offered by both Sonos and Definitive, none of the alternatives are going to come close to getting you that same bone-shaking feeling as the Phantom. Having twin woofers packed right into the all-purpose case gives it a leg up over less expensive self-contained options. But if you're looking for a totally custom multi-unit setup, you'll probably want to look elsewhere.", "The Phantom is an extremely powerful audio system and definitely provides more power and clarity than anything else its size. You'd need an amplifier, a DAC, and two or three loudspeakers at the very least to get close.

The first Tudor Submariner dive watch hit wrists in 1954 and had a lot in common with early Rolex dive watches of the same era. Over the next three decades, Tudor made\u00a0a series of Submariner dive watches in various colors with differing design details. In 2012, Tudor introduced the Heritage Black Bay, a modern dive watch that pays homage to the military Submariners of the 1970s with snowflake-style hands, gold dial printing, and a subdued\u00a0red bezel (inspired by a faded model in the company archive).\u00a0", "This even newer version starts with the same 41mm stainless steel case, still displays just the hours, minutes, and seconds, and is still meant to be an everyday watch that can take a beating.

The same\u00a0gold tint is used\u00a0for the vintage-style Tudor logo and other info at the dial's center. The hands and borders of the hour markers are gold with a creamy luminous fill. The bezel is matte black and has a small red triangle around the glowing pearl at 12 o'clock. The all-black color scheme with the gold printing is a direct homage to that 1954 Submariner, down to that little red triangle.

The little sister. Because Tudor has a more laid-back vibe and doesn't have the same totemic status to uphold, it can experiment a little more than Rolex. The big question is whether this experimentation will flow upstream eventually. Will we be seeing a vintage-inspired Submariner or a new Daytona that resembles the chronographs of the '70s? I think short term the answer is probably no, but one can always dream.", "The Tudor Heritage Black Bay \"Black\" comes on either an aged black leather strap ($3,100) or a stainless steel bracelet ($3,425), both of which come with a black fabric strap, too.

It's worth noting that, for now, Montblanc will not be making the e-Strap available as a standalone device.

Here are the 10\u00a0watches I'm still thinking about after the show.", "This watch really brings it. Longines packed an automatic monopusher chronograph into a streamlined 40 millimeter steel case and then added a 1920s-style dial with a bright red pulsometer scale (used by doctors to take a patient's pulse). That doesn't even take into account all the little technical flourishes in the movement, such as\u00a0the column wheel that ensures crisp and accurate measurements. This is one of the first watches I saw last\u00a0week, and I'm still wishing it were on my wrist.\u00a0", "Because of its longtime\u00a0status as a top-tier jewelry house, Chopard is one of the more underrated watch brands. The L.U.C line can compete with the likes of Patek and Vacheron, though it has its own, slightly less-traditional vibe. This rose gold \"regulator\" watch (one on which hours and minutes are tracked on separate axes) also has a second time zone and an nine-day power reserve. Did I mention it's chronometer-certified? Yeah, it's that, too. The time for classifying Chopard as a \"jewelry watch\" brand is long over, and this watch is further proof.\u00a0", "Maps on dials can be a controversial subject. Fans of mid-century enamel worldtimers will talk to you about craftsmanship and tradition and whatever, but most of the time I think they just look tacky. This new version of Laurent Ferrier's\u00a0dual-time Traveller watch (that window at 9 o'clock shows the hours of your second time zone), has a two-tone map that's a silver dome covered in black enamel that's worn away to reveal the continents. The hour markers hang out over the curvature of the dome. While it's so pretty on the front that\u00a0you might forget to turn the watch over, that would be a mistake: Ferrier's\u00a0micro-rotor movement could\u00a0be the most beautiful automatic caliber ever made. ", "Following up on its popular Dark and Grey Side of the Moon watches, this week Omega released a series of four new variations. There's one with a gold bezel, one that's totally blacked out, a third that's matte-finished, and one with some faux-vintage patina. The\u00a0last stole the show for me. It's the big black watch for the guy who hates big black watches. The aged leather strap looks as if\u00a0it came off an old motorcycle seat, and the creamy markers break up the black just enough. Now I just have to get cool enough to wear it. ", "This is the one Patek-lovers\u00a0have been waiting for. It's your basic, no-frills, time-only Nautilus in the classic \"Jumbo\" size (confusingly, Jumbo indicates that it's smaller than most of the other models), but this one comes in solid rose gold. That includes the bracelet, but the thin links make it feel\u00a0much lighter than most other all-gold\u00a0watches. The brown dial shifts in the light, begging you to show it off\u2014which may not the best idea, depending on where you are. No one will mistake this for anything but what it is.\u00a0", "Germany earned its watchmaking stripes by making crazily\u00a0accurate chronometers in the 19th century for merchant ships and scientific\u00a0use. This\u00a0watch takes that tradition and reinterprets it in a way that's thoroughly modern. The angular hands and scrolling numerals are all rendered in bright SuperLuminova for reading in the dark, and the panoramic date at 6 o'clock is carefully matched to the dark dial for a more discreet look. The movement has traditional German finishing, but if you're not careful, you'll be too busy looking at the awesome dial to notice.\u00a0", "Rarely do you see something entirely new at Baselworld. (Like never-seen-anything-even-close-to-similar-ever new.) This is just that. Finnish watchmaker Stepan Sarpaneva joined\u00a0with a Swedish specialist in luminous materials to create the Northern Lights. It lives up to its name and glows so brightly when the lights go out that its almost startling. Sarpaneva says you can leave it on your bedside table when you go to sleep, and it will still be visible in the morning. I'd love to try for myself, but he's making only eight of these in each of three colors:\u00a0blue, purple, and green.\u00a0\u20ac", "Perpetual calendars customarily involve a pile of windows and subdials pointing out four or five different measurements of time. The dials end up busy and crowded. Moser's perpetual skips the day-of-the-week indicator and uses a tiny arrow to count out the months, using the hour markers. He also puts the leap-year indicator on the movement (on the reverse), instead of the dial. This lets you fully appreciate the blue fum\u00e9 dial (", "), complemented by the distressed brown strap. This\u00a0is\u00a0high-end watchmaking without the\u00a0pretension.\u00a0", "The big TAG Heuer news from Basel was the forthcoming ", ", but the company haven't stopped working on the mechanical front. The new Caliber 18 Carrera looks almost exactly like the original model from 1963. If you're not an expert, it would actually be easy to mistake one for the other in photos\u2014the Caliber 18 is 39mm, while the first Carrera was\u00a036mm\u2014a dead giveaway in person. The domed sapphire crystal, faded grey markers, and sharply angled lugs (not to mention that old-school Heuer logo, sans TAG) are all spot-on. I had a hard time handing the sample back.\u00a0", "These might be the best watches to come out of Baselworld 2015. There, I said it. The new\u00a0Slim d'Herm\u00e8s collection contains a few models, but the two starts are a time-only automatic and a dual-time perpetual calendar. Both are powered by thin automatic movements (wound by a micro-rotor) that are made in-house by\u00a0Herm\u00e8s. Everything, from the case shape to the numerals to the dial layouts, feels well-thought-out and complementary. Rarely do brands get it this right. "]},

Instead of the thick lugs with curved bevels along the edges, the 1016 has a case with softer swooping lugs. They should be polished on the sides and evenly brushed on top, with the holds sitting right in the middle and not too close to the edges.

The fries are glorious as well: thick, dark-edged, and crisp, with tender, steam-releasing centers.

The salad didn't look like any Caesar I'd\u00a0ever had.\u00a0", "It was a\u00a0bounty of colorful leaves\u2014purple Treviso and Tardivo and violet-studded yellow Castelfranco radicchios, lime green Little Gem lettuces, deep blue-green Lacinato kale, and hot pink tie-dyed watermelon radish rounds. And loads of depth.", "The\u00a0name had misled my dining companion, too, who awaited the creamy cheesiness of a traditional Caesar,\u00a0made from\u00a0the inner leaves of Romaine lettuce, tossed-in grated Parmesan, and a lemony dressing that contains mustard, garlic, pounded anchovy fillets, and egg yolk. Caesar salads are usually topped with big croutons and sprinkled with an extra helping of Parmesan, but these were nowhere to be found.", "So I was skeptical, until I tasted it. The salad was lighter, sharper, and cleaner than the classic but with all of the same essential flavors. Sweet red wine vinegar, bitter greens, sour lemon, peppery radish, and something mysteriously savory played nicely off one another. The leaves were dusted with delicate breadcrumbs instead of croutons. I tasted a burst of anchovy in the dressing, but there was another flavor there, something I couldn\u2019t place.\u00a0", "It was late on a Saturday afternoon when I met up with Smillie to find out. The chef resembles a giant version of the Dennis the Menace cartoon character\u2014boyish, blond, mischievous. While a crowd of stylish New Yorkers lingered over brunch, Smillie and I worked at the kitchen pass, illuminated with soft glowing golden light. A clean-cut sous chef arrived with the prep\u2014a small sheet tray of leaves; a bowl of breadcrumbs; and nearly sheer radish rounds floating in ice water.", "\u201cI wanted to make an\u00a0", "\u00a0salad,\u201d Smillie explained as he took over and squeezed an entire tube of anchovy paste into a bowl, followed by two large spoonfuls of Dijon mustard. Anchovy paste, found at most specialty food stores, is simply finely pur\u00e9ed salt-cured anchovy fillets with a touch of neutral oil, such as\u00a0sunflower seed oil. While many Caesar salad recipes call for grinding anchovy fillets into the garlic using the side of a knife blade, Smillie cuts this step by using a good-quality paste. (He prefers one by Scalia, a Sicilian brand.) Herein lies the secret\u2014doubling down on anchovies.", "Though the restaurant was named after Smillie\u2019s birthplace in San Bernardino County, and the food is described as Californian, Smillie spent years honing his Italian cooking skills with Jonathan Waxman at Barbuto and most recently at the helm of Il Buco Alimentari. So it\u2019s only natural that he uses these tiny, saltwater fish\u00a0with abandon.", "\u201cWe make our dressing with less vinegar, then we refresh it with a burst of citrus and olive oil on the pickup,\u201d Smillie said. He tore the kale leaves in two, but the other greens went into the mixing bowl whole. Then he sprinkled a teaspoon of breadcrumbs over the salad and carefully folded in the dressing. It\u2019s those breadcrumbs that give the salad, as Smillie puts it, \u201ca mysterious oceanic flavor that you can\u2019t put your finger on.\u201d It's because he mixes in anchovy powder with the crispy crumbs.\u00a0", "He discovered the technique at Il Buco Alimentari, when he was toying with a dehydrator and oil-packed anchovies: The dried fish crumble into an intensely flavorful powder. I\u2019ve since sprinkled Smillie\u2019s savory pixie dust over steak, spaghetti, and eggs. Like truffles, soy sauce, and MSG, this powder offers a hard dose of umami\u2014truly habit-forming savoriness.\u00a0", "Though Upland sells about 50 of these \u201cCaesar\u201d salads a night, seasonality will force the dish to evolve. \u201cIn another two weeks, we\u2019ll replace the watermelon radishes with lime radishes. And as the kale gets sweeter this summer, the dressing may need to be more acidic,\u201d said Smillie as he pulled a curled watermelon radish from the icy deep. He shook the water off and tucked it between a Treviso and Little Gem. Smillie thinks that leaving the radish a little wet and without dressing makes it\u00a0taste refreshing, the same way a cold glass of water does.\u00a0", "When it comes to the lettuces, Little Gems, Castelfranco, Tardivo, and Treviso radicchios can be hard to find, in which case\u00a0you can use any combination of radicchio, curly kale, endive, Romaine, or even thin slices of Brussels sprouts.\u00a0An all-kale salad or all-Treviso could be delicious too, but as you build it, think about how to balance the bitterness of the radicchio with the sweetness of romaine.\u00a0", "Whether or not you want to call your salad a Caesar?

I stopped seeking comments when my total reached 20.\u00a0", "Some were fatalistic, saying that family commitments are likely to keep the numbers down in the long run. Others said things were changing, that the traditional male dominance in London restaurants was fading away. And some disputed that women had been disadvantaged at all.", "Here's what they had to say:", "\"Twenty years ago, there were hardly any women in the kitchen. But in the last few years, women are becoming very strong, and we're going to see more women in charge. Kitchens were always dark and hidden away, but now they are often in the restaurant. It's a different ambience, more open and enjoyable.\"", "\"I have five restaurants, and three of those are run by women. I try and employ by ability and drive. It just so happens that they are women. They were the ones that were prepared to work hard and push through the pain and are passionate.\"", "\"We have always had at least 50 percent women in our brigade here at Clarke's, sometimes as high as 75/25 female-to-male ratio, so I think it's something of a myth about there being a shortage of female head chefs. Perhaps it's down to the fact that on the whole, women are more modest about their capabilities and achievements than their male counterparts, and so you just have to look harder to find them.\"", "\"At one stage, you just have to make a choice. You have to be very, very involved for long hours\u2014a difficult job when you are a chef. Many\u00a0women want to be a wife; they want to be a mother. And I'm not sure that everything is compatible.\"", "\"At a certain stage in their career, it comes down to the choice of whether or not to have a family. A pregnant woman in the kitchen is not ideal or easy: I've been there. Taking time out to raise a child obviously will affect your time in a kitchen, which is normally 7 a.m. until midnight. Not everyone can afford child care and nannies.\"", "\"There are quite a few amazing women chefs: Angela Hartnett, Anna Hansen, Ruth Rogers\u2014and that's just London. Ruth, along with Rose Gray and Alice Waters, and Maggie Beer, have been some of my biggest inspirations.

It is fun to see the girl getting appointed at the Savoy after 126 years. It's encouraging. There is an element of sexism, but times are changing. For decades, we've been the ones at home, breeding, but it's not our passage in life anymore.\"", "\"The industry is very different from how it used to be: We're in a time that is exciting for women and men. Those who work the hardest and put the time in in the kitchen and have ideas can succeed. It's not being a woman that holds you back. I can't speak for the past, only the present, and everywhere I look, there are women inspiring me. I was very excited when Kim got the job [at the Savoy Grill]. I punched the air. It's great for all women. You are going to be left behind if you are only going to choose boys for leading.\"", "\"It's very difficult to balance the job and having children where in society, generally women are the primary carers at home. It's not that it can't be done, and some people manage very well, but maybe women have already left the kitchen before the position of head chef, so there are fewer sous chefs to become head chefs. There are also fewer women in kitchens at any level, so there will always be a smaller pool of people to draw from when it comes to the head chef position.\"", "\"Like any high-powered job (you don't see many female CEOs, either), running a restaurant is extremely challenging on all fronts. The pressure is intense, the stress oftentimes overwhelming, and the hours are long. You have to be able to wear the pants, and it can be very difficult to do so and have a balanced personal life as well, which makes having a family challenging.\"", "\"There aren't that many female chefs, so the likelihood of female head chefs is a lot lower in the first place. So the question is: Why do so few women want to join the profession?' I think this career path is seen as a tough environment, sometimes intimidating, with long, unsociable hours and low pay, which doesn't appeal to a lot of young women.\"", "\"Times are changing. Women are having babies later, and more and more women are coming along. To be honest, I've always seen it as a huge advantage [to be a woman] because you stand out more. I've never seen it as an issue. It's an awesome and exciting job for both sexes.\"", "\"Statistically, there are fewer female chefs than male. And then the age when you might become a head chef, in your thirties, is when women are thinking about having families, and the two don't correlate. I'm getting married next year, and I don't know what I am going to do.\"", "\"There are loads and loads of women head chefs. They are just not on camera.\" [You don't see this as an issue?] \"No.\"", "\"There is a time when you have small children and it can be very hard.

Since that time, Bulgari has moved all its work in house, from dials to cases to movements, and it has\u00a0garnered a lot of esteem along the way. The Octo Finnissimo is the world\u2019s thinnest minute repeater; at 6.85 mm, it is thinner than an iPhone 6.

At the center of the movement is a globe that\u00a0tells you whether it\u2019s day or night, and on the baseplate is a ring that tells you the sidereal time, which is the time relative to the stars (instead of the sun).

Once we built a website, chefs in Atlanta began commissioning us for knives, and a few home and design blogs picked us up. The process begins with finding the perfect metal, shaping it, then heat-treating it in a 1,500F oven to harden. From there, blades undergo weeks of testing, grinding, finishing, and sharpening. Foraging for parts is half the fun: We source metals from Volkswagen junkyards and machine shops. These are products we want our customers to have for life\u2014we offer an unconditional lifetime warranty and free service. Even if you run over the knife with your car, we\u2019ll fix it for you free of charge.\u201d ", "\u201cI went to Morocco in 2008 and fell in love with all the Bedouin jewelry there. The crescent moon-shaped earrings and gold tassel necklaces inspired me to try my hand at jewelry. I came out with my first collection in 2010\u201450 pieces of turquoise earrings, necklaces, and rings. To this day, the 14-karat triangle studs from my debut collection are bestsellers. My philosophy is that great design should merge the precious with the practical: I\u2019ll set a rare Australian opal on a curved gold band, for example, or surround an oblong-shaped piece of aquamarine with pinprick-size red diamonds. White solitaires are great, but there\u2019s something unconventionally graceful about an engagement ring with a pear-cut Montana sapphire or a cognac-colored tourmaline. I try to keep that in mind with my everyday collections, which feature hexagon-shaped pearl pendants and emerald-and-black-diamond cluster rings. My trick is not to overdesign anything. I\u2019d rather surprise customers with shapes, colors, and stones that they\u2019d never think to combine.\u201d ", "\u201cI got my first mountain bike at 13, and I fell in love with the sport. In 2002, I launched Geekhouse Bikes, a line of bespoke, versatile cycles. Every component, from the leather on the seat to the width of the tires, is built for the individual rider. Our eight-month design process starts with selecting one of seven base styles: The Porteur Brentwood is a no-frills commuter bike; the Rando is for long-haul cross-country bikers. After consulting with clients about lifestyle and injuries, then their neck width and foot size, we handcraft bikes from American steel and finish them in one of 6,500 baked-on powder coats. We work with a local painter who adds designs like art deco patterns or World War\u00a0I battleships.

It started life in 1879 as the Inglewood estate, and it\u2019s the kind of spot you imagine when dreaming of slipping into the Napa Valley lifestyle. The yellow Victorian house with its big front porch, built in 1881, came with an old stone winery, nine and a half acres of organic vines, a tennis court, a private lake with rowboats, gardens, olive trees, and smooth green lawns dotted with giant palms and ginkgo trees.\u00a0", "It seduced Sinegal, who\u2019s 50 and on his second family.

For example, they give different amounts of water to each individual vine. They divide even small vineyard blocks into two-ton lots so they can\u00a0harvest grapes in perfect condition. They even get goats to do the weeding between the vines. All this deep analysis takes the latest wine buzz term, \u201cprecision viticulture,\u201d to a whole new level.\u00a0", "The first two wines being released, from the 2013 vintage, are surprisingly good. The cabernet comes in the super heavy bottle now de rigueur for very expensive New World red vino.

Big and rich, it\u2019s smooth and concentrated, with notes of tobacco and cassis, a silky texture, and dark, spicy fruit. It\u2019s more balanced than many of the valley\u2019s expensive cabs, too, though it lacks a bit of brightness and lift. Only 700 cases were produced. The sauvignon blanc ($45) is chalky and layered, rich and complex. \u00a0", "(Next up? The 2013 reserve cabernet, offered as futures last spring, which will be released next February, costs $195; ditto a 2013 cabernet franc at $140.)\u00a0", "If you sign on to the mailing list now, you can purchase as few or as many bottles as you want of the estate cabernet and sauvignon blanc\u2014and you\u2019ll automatically get a notification of future releases, when you\u2019ll get a chance to sign up for one of three tiers of membership. The lowest level includes six bottles of estate cabernet and three bottles each of reserve cabernet and cabernet franc per year for $1,545. The second tier gets you double those numbers of bottles for $3,090, and the top level, Tier 1881, throws in more reserve cabernet and magnums of all three reds for $5,200.\u00a0", "And being on the mailing list entitles you to those winery visits\u2014limited to 21 people a day.\u00a0", "Sinegal is part of a new trend of how Napa\u2019s luxury cab startups, which formerly relied on collector buzz, are using the lure of exclusive experiences to build a fan base.\u00a0", "I guess they\u2019re on to something.\u00a0 Last year, a report by\u00a0Boston Consulting Group said that experiential luxury accounts for 55 percent of global luxury spending.\u00a0", "My bet is that Sinegal\u2019s project has staying power because it\u2019s more than a luxury cab invented out of branding and marketing concepts.

But alongside these composites are things that Andrew says he won\u2019t touch, such as\u00a0the Cha Ca La Vong, a famous dish from a Hanoi restaurant by the same name.\u00a0", "To make it, Andrew marinates catfish with fermented rice paste, turmeric, ginger, and shrimp paste, which stains\u00a0it a gorgeous neon yellow and lends it a\u00a0soft edge of sourness. The fish is served with an ostentatious amount of dill and herbs over fresh rice noodles. And it\u2019s delicious like that, the way it\u2019s been eaten for more than\u00a0a hundred years, the way it\u2019s now served at the Pig and the Lady.\u00a0", "But you can find it other ways there, too: Andrew stuffs the La Vong-style catfish in a sandwich with local tomatoes and pickles and calls it a Po\u2019 Boy. And he recently piled small pieces of it on fresh, shining betel leaves with noodles to make a tasty little cocktail snack.\u00a0", "\u201cSometimes you have to keep it hard-core traditional,\u201d he says.

Cannabis contains two crucial components: THC, the psychoactive element most closely associated with feeling high, and CBD, which has no hallucinogenic impact and usually leads to alertness.

Caffeine is absorbed almost instantly by the body, but it takes from\u00a045 minutes to 90 minutes for the human body to process the weed so it can prolong the caffeine high, Stites says.\u00a0", "The potential profits from a mashup of coffee and caffeine are, well, high. Per IRI data from Bloomberg Intelligence, coffee sales in America totaled\u00a0$9.4 billion in the 52 weeks ending Nov. 1;\u00a0it\u2019s harder to gauge the size of the pot industry nationwide, but most estimates put it around $3 billion annually.
