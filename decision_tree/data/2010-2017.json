The effect is biggest on men in this scenario, who see an increase in mortality risk of about 20 percent.", "The authors found no rise in mortality among those for whom 62 was not the eligibility threshold for collecting Social Security. Moreover, demographic groups with the highest rate of retirement at 62 had the highest mortality rate increases at that age. The paper notes that the phenomenon\u00a0may be linked partly to existing health problems that force some to stop working early.", "Mortality rates for Americans as a whole, and especially for children, were down in 2013-2015 from 15 years prior. But death rates went in the opposite direction for rural, working-age people after more than a century of decline, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Abuse of prescription medications, especially opioids, and related heroine-overdose deaths played a large role in the increase.", "There is a popular argument that lower availability of healthy food choices in poorer neighborhoods has a meaningful, negative impact on eating habits. These so-called \u201cfood deserts\u201d are dominated by grocery and convenience stores where healthy foods are in low supply and carry high prices. The authors of this study, however, reject that notion.", "They find that the entrance of supermarkets offering healthy options didn\u2019t materially increase healthy eating habits. The authors instead put more than\u00a090 percent of the blame for nutrition inequality on differences in demand that are \u201cpartially explained by education, nutrition knowledge and regional preferences.\u201d", "Antitrust regulators tend to focus their scrutiny on how big mergers and acquisitions may affect pricing and consumers. New research shows they may be missing the anti-competitive impact these tie-ups have on the labor market. It may also help the Federal Reserve better understand low wage gains.", "The authors used data from CareerBuilder.com to analyze employer concentration in more than 8,000 labor markets categorized by occupation and geography. They found increased concentration of employers is associated with low wages. In fact, moving from the 25 percentile in concentration to the 75th percentile results in a wage decline of 15 percent to 25 percent."]},

Keep in mind that the best advice depends specifically on how you\u2019re going to be affected by the tax bill.\u00a0While most Americans would get a tax cut in the short term, some taxpayers could\u00a0see higher tax bills in 2018.\u00a0\u201cNo individual is average,\u201d\u00a0Suzanne Shier, a tax strategist at Northern Trust Corp., reminds us. \u201cAn average is a composite of multiple individuals.\u201d", "If your taxes are set to spike in 2018, many of these strategies won\u2019t work as well.

Most deductions, including the charitable one, can only be claimed if you itemize your tax return. The bill would sharply limit the number of taxpayers who would benefit from itemizing: First it\u00a0raises\u00a0the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for single people, and $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. Second, it limits other deductions\u2014most famously for state and local taxes\u2014so it\u2019s harder for taxpayers to reach the threshold where itemizing makes sense.", "So,\u00a0you might want to think about making\u00a0several years of charitable donations this month if you can afford it, said Philip \u201cRusty\u201d Ross, a financial adviser at Exencial Wealth Advisors based in Oklahoma City. If you\u2019re not sure where to donate, you can open a donor-advised fund and decide later where your money will go. But move fast\u2014there are only two weeks left in December.", "Another traditional recommendation for this time of year\u00a0is to defer income. While salaried workers generally can\u2019t choose when they get paid, business owners can often delay registering\u00a0income until the following year, lowering their April tax bill\u00a0in the process. Investors can also control their taxable income\u2014and thus lower capital\u00a0gains tax bills\u2014by selling losing stocks\u00a0or\u00a0waiting to sell winning stocks until 2018.\u00a0In most years, deferring income merely delays the taxes you will have to pay eventually. But, if you expect your tax rate to fall next year, deferring income into 2018 could actually save you money.

The move by the Republican-controlled Congress was criticized by Democrats as an effort to\u00a0make citizens of high-tax blue states pay for benefits to\u00a0corporations and\u00a0citizens of low-tax red states.\u00a0As a result, advisers had been planning to instruct\u00a0clients targeted by this provision to find ways to maximize their SALT deduction in 2017, by pre-paying\u00a0next year\u2019s taxes as much as allowed and deducting them\u00a0under the old rules. But the final compromise bill, unveiled Friday by Republicans in the Senate and House,\u00a0explicitly closes this loophole with respect to income taxes. Any\u00a02018 state and local income taxes paid ahead of time would nevertheless need to be\u00a0counted on next year\u2019s taxes, according to the bill. However, taxpayers\u00a0could still pre-pay property taxes due in 2018, and deduct them under the old rules. Additionally, any taxes due for 2017\u2014or any late\u00a0taxes from previous years\u2014could still be deducted on a tax return due this April.", "Current tax law allows employees to deduct unreimbursed\u00a0expenses related to their jobs\u00a0as long as they\u2019re more than 2 percent of income. The tax bill ends these itemized deductions after the end of this\u00a0year.

The flood illuminator beams infrared light, which the camera uses to establish the presence of a face.\u00a0The projector then flashes 30,000 dots onto the face which the phone uses to decide whether to unlock the home screen.\u00a0The system uses a two-stage process because the dot projector makes big computational demands and would rapidly drain the battery if activated as frequently as the flood illuminator.", "The dot projector is at the heart of Apple\u2019s production problems. In September, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was having trouble producing the modules that combine to make the dot projector, causing shortages. The dot projector uses something called a vertical cavity surface-emitting laser, or VCSEL. The laser beams light through a lens known as a wafer-level optic, which focuses it into the 30,000 points of infra-red light projected onto the user\u2019s face. The laser is\u00a0made of gallium arsenide, a semiconductor material, and the lens is constructed of glass; both are fragile and easily broken. Precision is key. If the microscopic components are off by even several microns, a fraction of a hair\u2019s breadth,\u00a0the technology might not work\u00a0properly, according to people with knowledge of the situation.", "To make matters worse, Apple lost one of its laser suppliers early on. Finisar\u00a0Corp. failed to meet Apple\u2019s specifications in time for the start of production, and now\u00a0the\u00a0Sunnyvale, California-based company is racing to meet the standards by the end of October. That left Apple reliant on fewer laser suppliers:\u00a0Lumentum Holdings Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0II-VI Inc.", "The fragility of the components created problems for\u00a0LG Innotek\u00a0Co.\u00a0and Sharp Corp., both of which struggled to combine the laser and lens to make\u00a0dot projectors. At one point\u00a0only\u00a0about 20 percent of the dot projectors the two companies produced were usable,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the manufacturing process. LG Innotek\u00a0and Sharp slowed the production process down in an effort to prevent breakages and ensure the components were assembled with the required level of precision.\u00a0", "LG Innotek\u00a0confirmed in a conference call\u00a0with analysts Wednesday that there has been a problem with yield and that mass production is just beginning.\u00a0The current modules are\u00a0\u201csignificantly\u201d more difficult to produce than previous cameras, said Kim Jong-ho, who oversees the South Korean supplier\u2019s optical solution division. He said manufacturing has improved enough to meet the iPhone X launch date, though supply may be limited, and stressed\u00a0Innotek has been able to achieve a \u201cfar stronger\u201d yield than a rival supplier\u2014a reference to Sharp. The Japanese company\u00a0declined to comment.", "To boost the number of usable dot projectors and accelerate production, Apple\u00a0relaxed some of the specifications for Face ID, according to a different person with knowledge of the process. As a result, it took less time to\u00a0test completed modules, one of the major sticking points, the person said.\u00a0", "It\u2019s not clear how much the new specs will reduce the technology\u2019s efficacy.\u00a0Eecutives initially announced in September that there was a one in a million chance that an interloper could defeat Face ID to unlock a phone. Even downgraded, it\u00a0will probably\u00a0still\u00a0be far more accurate than Touch ID, where the odds of someone other than the owner of a phone being able to unlock it are one in 50,000.", "Besides struggling to produce enough 3-D sensors, Apple\u00a0has suffered from a dearth of suppliers capable of making organic light-emitting diode displays, Bloomberg reported last year. The OLED, which delivers sharper images,\u00a0is the iPhone X\u2019s other main advance. But\u00a0Apple is dependent on Samsung Electronics Co.\u00a0for\u00a0its entire supply of the components.", "For months, Apple investors have fretted that a shortage of iPhone Xs would send consumers into the arms of rival smartphone makers such as Samsung\u00a0and Huawei\u00a0Technologies Co. Apple seems to have overcome\u00a0the biggest production hurdles.\u00a0Sharp is working to bring the production yield for dot projectors above 50 percent, while LG Innotek\u00a0has already surpassed that level, which both companies consider\u00a0acceptable.\u00a0Meanwhile, Apple is working with Taiwan\u2019s Himax Technologies Inc. to boost production of lenses to make up for lower-than-needed output from Heptagon, a Singaporean company that so far has been the only lens supplier.", "The 3-D sensor shortage is expected to end in early 2018.

To get published in journals, he said, there\u2019s a powerful temptation to torture the data until it confesses\u2014that is, to conduct round after round of tests in search of a finding that can be claimed to be statistically significant. Said Harvey, a professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business: \u201cUnfortunately, our standard testing methods are often ill-equipped to answer the questions that we pose.\u201d He exhorted the group: \u201cWe are not salespeople.

Mass-market products such as exchange-traded funds are being concocted using the same flawed statistical techniques you find in scholarly journals. Most of the empirical research in finance is likely false, Harvey wrote in a paper with a Duke colleague, Yan Liu, in 2014. \u201cThis implies that half the financial products (promising outperformance) that companies are selling to clients are false.\u201d", "Most of us have a vague sense that we\u2019re being ripped off by investment firms that charge hefty fees while producing results that are no better than you\u2019d get throwing darts at a page of stock listings.

And it\u2019s important to understand the mechanics of what has gone wrong.", "The core of the problem is that it\u2019s hard to beat the market, but people keep trying anyway. An abundance of computing power makes it possible to test thousands, even millions, of trading strategies. The standard method is to see how the strategy would have done if it had been used during the ups and downs of the market over, say, the past 20 years. This is called backtesting. As a quality check, the technique is then tested on a separate set of \u201cout-of-sample\u201d data\u2014i.e., market history that wasn\u2019t used to create the technique.", "In the wrong hands, though, backtesting can go horribly wrong. It once found that the best predictor of the S&P 500, out of all the series in a batch of United Nations data, was butter production in Bangladesh. The nerd webcomic ", " by Randall Munroe captures the ethos perfectly: It features a woman claiming jelly beans cause acne. When a statistical test shows no evidence of an effect, she revises her claim\u2014it must depend on the flavor of jelly bean. So the statistician tests 20 flavors. Nineteen show nothing. By chance there\u2019s a high correlation between jelly bean consumption and acne breakouts for one flavor. The final panel of the cartoon is the front page of a newspaper: \u201cGreen Jelly Beans Linked to Acne! 95% Confidence. Only 5% Chance of Coincidence!\u201d", "It\u2019s worse for financial data because researchers have more knobs to twist in search of a prized \u201canomaly\u201d\u2014a subtle pattern in the data that looks like it could be a moneymaker. They can vary the period, the set of securities under consideration, or even the statistical method. Negative findings go in a file drawer; positive ones get submitted to a journal (tenure!) or made into an ETF whose performance we rely on for retirement. Testing out-of-sample data to keep yourself honest helps, but it doesn\u2019t cure the problem. With enough tests, eventually by chance even your safety check will show the effect you want.", "Harvey\u2019s term for torturing the data until it confesses is \u201cp-hacking,\u201d a reference to the p-value, a measure of statistical significance. P-hacking is also known as overfitting, data-mining\u2014or data-snooping, the coinage of Andrew Lo, director of MIT\u2019s Laboratory of Financial Engineering. Says Lo: \u201cThe more you search over the past, the more likely it is you are going to find exotic patterns that you happen to like or focus on. Those patterns are least likely to repeat.\u201d", "Such tricks weren\u2019t necessary when Wall Streeters could make a good living charging for their stock-selection skills.

Stocks in the index are weighted by market value, so Apple is 3.7 percent of the S&P 500 while Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. is just 0.008 percent.

But\u00a0when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it\u00a0has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of\u00a0the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life.\u00a0", "In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen.\u00a0", "In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects.

Those visits have become\u00a0less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation.", "In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and\u00a0most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power.\u00a0", "That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power.\u00a0Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn\u2019t look good on such a large product.\u00a0", "In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning\u00a0designers and engineers must\u00a0work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now \"asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable,\" a person familiar with the matter said.\u00a0", "When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end,\u00a0Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal.", "For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers\u00a0wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy).

More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads.\u00a0", "In 2013, Apple\u00a0launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the U.S. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused\u00a0production headaches though.\u00a0", "The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then\u00a0train people to run\u00a0those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand.", "Three years on,\u00a0the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of\u00a0moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions.", "The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the U.S.\u00a0", "Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs.\u00a0In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. \"We have great desktops in our roadmap.

It went from 32-nanometer production in 2009 to 22nm in 2011 to 14nm in late 2014, the state of the art. Each of those jumps to smaller switches means chip designers can cram about twice as many into the same area. This phenomenon is known as Moore\u2019s Law, and it has, for half a century, ensured that the chip you buy three years from now will be at least twice as good as the one you buy today.", "The latest Xeon chips take advantage of research that began in the 1990s, when Bohr\u2019s team in Oregon began trying to deal with quantum tunneling, or the tendency of electrons to jump through very small transistors, even when they\u2019re switched off. It was the latest front in Intel\u2019s ongoing war with physics. It had been conventional wisdom that once silicon transistors shrunk to below 65nm, they\u2019d stop working properly. Bohr\u2019s solution, unveiled in 2007, was to coat parts of the transistor with hafnium, a silvery metal not found in nature, and then, starting in 2011, to build transistors into little towers known as fin-shaped field effect transistors, or FinFETs. \u201cOur first FinFET, instead of being narrow and straight, it was more of a trapezoid,\u201d Bohr says with a hint of disappointment\u2014trapezoidal fins take up more room than rectangular ones. \u201cThese are thinner and straighter,\u201d he says proudly, gesturing at a recent photograph, taken with an electron microscope, that shows two stock-straight black shadows resting eerily on a grayish base. The images look like dental X-rays. Intel people call them \u201cbaby pictures.\u201d", "Shrinking the transistors is only part of the challenge. Another is managing an ever more complex array of interconnects, the crisscrossing filaments that link the transistors to one another. The Xeon features 13 layers of copper wires, some thinner than a single virus, made by etching tiny lines into an insulating glass and then depositing metal in the slots. Whereas transistors have tended to get more efficient as they\u2019ve shrunk, smaller wires by their nature don\u2019t. The smaller they are, the less current they carry.", "The man in charge of the Xeon E5\u2019s wiring is Kevin Fischer, a midlevel Intel engineer who sat down in his Oregon lab in early 2009 with a simple goal: Fix the conductivity of two of the most densely packed layers of wires, known as Metal 4 and Metal 6. Fischer, 45, who has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, started the way Intel researchers usually do, by scouring the academic literature. Intel already used copper, one of the most conductive metals, so he decided to focus on improving the insulators, or dielectrics, which tend to slow down the current moving through the wires. One option would be to use new insulators that are spongier and thus create less drag. But Fischer suggested replacing the glass with nothing at all. \u201cAir is the ultimate dielectric,\u201d he says, as if stunned by the elegance of his solution. The idea worked. Metal layers 4 and 6 now move 10 percent faster.", "Chip design is mostly a layout problem. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like designing a city,\u201d says Mooly Eden, a retired Intel engineer who ran the company\u2019s PC division. But the urban-planning analogy may undersell the difficulty. A chip designer must somehow fit the equivalent of the world\u2019s population into 1 square inch\u2014and arrange everything in such a way that the computer has access to each individual transistor 3 billion times per second.", "The building blocks of a chip are memory controllers, cache, input/output circuits, and, most important of all, cores. On the Pentium III chip you owned in the late 1990s, the core and the chip were more or less one and the same, and chips generally got better by increasing the clock rate\u2014the number of times per second the computer can switch its transistors on and off. A decade ago, clock rates maxed out at about 4 gigahertz, or 4 billion pulses per second. If chips were to cycle any faster, the silicon transistors would overheat and malfunction. The chip industry\u2019s answer was to start adding cores, essentially little chips within the chip, which can run simultaneously, like multiple outboard motors on a speedboat. The plan for the new E5 called for up to 22 of them, six more than the previous version, which would be designed at Intel\u2019s development center in Haifa, Israel.", "Another way to make a chip faster is to add special circuits that only do one thing, but do it extremely quickly. Roughly 25 percent of the E5\u2019s circuits are specialized for, among other tasks, compressing video and encrypting data. There are other special circuits on the E5, but Intel can\u2019t talk about those because they\u2019re created for its largest customers, the so-called Super 7: ", ", Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. Those companies buy\u2014and often assemble for themselves\u2014Xeon-powered servers by the hundreds of thousands. If you buy an off-the-shelf Xeon server from Dell or HP, the Xeon inside will contain technology that\u2019s off-limits to you. \u201cWe\u2019ll integrate [a cloud customer\u2019s] unique feature into the product, as long as it doesn\u2019t make the die so much bigger that it becomes a cost burden for everyone else,\u201d says Bryant. \u201cWhen we ship it to Customer A, he\u2019ll see it. Customer B has no idea that feature is there.\u201d", "It takes a year for Intel\u2019s architects\u2014the most senior designers, who work closely with customers as well as researchers in Oregon\u2014to produce a spec, a several-thousand-page document that explains the chip\u2019s functions in extreme detail. It takes an additional year and a half to translate the spec into a kind of software code composed of basic logic instructions such as AND, OR, and NOT, and then translate that into a schematic showing the individual circuits. The final and most labor-intensive part of this process, mask design, involves figuring out how to cram the circuits into a physical layout. The layout is eventually transferred onto masks, the stencils used to burn tiny patterns on the silicon wafer and ultimately make a chip. For the E5, mask designers based in Bangalore, India, and Fort Collins, Colo., used a computer-aided design program to draw polygons to represent each transistor, or copied in previously drawn circuit designs from a sort of digital library. \u201cYou have to have the ability to visualize what you\u2019re working on in 3D,\u201d says Corrina Mellinger, a veteran Intel mask designer.", "Unlike most of the technical jobs at Intel, mask design doesn\u2019t require an advanced degree in engineering. The work is learned as a trade; Mellinger took a single class in chip layout at a community college after joining Intel in 1989 as an administrative assistant. The final few weeks of a mask design are always the most intense, as designers continually update their work to accommodate last-minute additions to the layout. \u201cIt never fits at first,\u201d says Patricia Kummrow, an Intel VP and manager of the Fort Collins design team. The best mask designers can look at the polygons and instantaneously see how to shrink the design by rerouting circuits onto different layers. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve finished a puzzle, and now you come and tell me I need to add 10 more pieces,\u201d says Mellinger. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018OK, let me see what kind of magic I can work.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", " literally what they do, every day.

Maria Lines, an Intel product manager, becomes emotional when she reflects on the past few years of her career. \u201cThe product that I was on several generations ago was about 2 billion transistors, and now the product I\u2019m on today has 10 billion transistors,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s like, astounding. It\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s almost as magical as having a baby.\u201d", "The moment of birth of a chip is known as first silicon. For the E5, first silicon happened in 2014. A team in Bangalore sent a 7.5-gigabyte file containing the full design to Intel\u2019s mask shop in Santa Clara. The masks, 6-by-6-inch quartz plates that feature slightly blown-up versions of the transistors to be printed on each chip, were shipped the following week to an Intel fab near Phoenix that is an exact copy of the Oregon facility, and the machines began their slow, exacting work.", "After all of the round-the-clock scrambling, designers spent most of 2015 waiting for new prototypes to test. Each \u201crev,\u201d or revision, takes three months or so to make. \u201cIt\u2019s tedious,\u201d says Stephen Smith, an Intel vice president and general manager of the data center engineering group. This, for all the intricacy of the circuits, is what makes microchip development among the highest-stakes bets in all of business. If you have more than a few excursions by the time you get to first silicon, there will be long delays and lost revenue. And with every generation of ever smaller transistor, the stakes get higher. Krzanich notes that it takes twice as long to fab a chip today as it did 10 years ago. \u201cMaking something smaller is a problem of physics, and there are always ways to solve that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe trick is, can you deliver that part at half the cost?\u201d", "The last step in the manufacturing process happens at assembly plants in Malaysia, China, and Vietnam. There, diamond saws cut the finished wafers into squares, which are then packaged and tested. In fall 2015, Intel shipped more than 100,000 chips, gratis, to the Super 7 and other big customers. Last-minute tweaks were made to the software that ships with each chip, and Intel spent six weeks or so doing final tests. Full manufacturing of the new E5 didn\u2019t begin until earlier this year, in Arizona and at another identical fab in Leixlip, Ireland. Over the next 12 months, Intel will sell millions of them.", "If customers are lucky, they\u2019ll probably never see those chips, much less consider how they were made. But if you opened up a new server, you\u2019d eventually find a healthy chip, hot to the touch and sealed in ceramic packaging that bears a blue Intel logo. If you looked inside the housing, you\u2019d find the 13 layers of interconnects, which to the naked eye look like nothing more than a dull metal plate. Many layers below would be the silicon, shimmering in blues and oranges and purples\u2014a tiny, teeming maze of circuits that somehow makes our whole world work. It\u2019s beautiful, you might think.", "Bohr, Intel\u2019s lead manufacturing researcher, sometimes thinks the same thing. But as a scientist, he understands that what he sees aren\u2019t really colors\u2014they\u2019re just light, reflected and refracted by the designs he and his colleagues have imprinted on the silicon. The individual transistors themselves are smaller than any wave of light. \u201cWhen you get dimensions that small, color has no meaning,\u201d he says, and then excuses himself.", "He\u2019s late for a meeting to discuss Intel\u2019s 5-nanometer chips, two generations from the current E5. Five nanometers is regarded by many in the chip business as the point after which it won\u2019t be possible to scale down further, when Moore\u2019s Law will finally fail. Intel hopes to use something called extreme ultraviolet light, a new technology that the industry has yet to harness effectively, to help get there.

When the CAPE is high, Shiller has found annual returns will tend to be lower over a long period. A low CAPE augurs above-average returns.", "The average CAPE ratio for U.S. stocks over the past 100 years was about 17. It stands at 29.6 now\u2014the only times it was higher were in 1929 and around the dot-com bubble, Shiller says.

And yet the #ExxonKnew backlash comes at a financially perilous time for Big Oil. A glut-driven collapse in crude prices has rocked the entire industry. On July\u00a029, Exxon announced second-quarter profit of $1.7\u00a0billion, its worst result in 17\u00a0years. That followed a rocky spring when ferocious wildfires reduced production in the oil-sands region of western Canada. (The frequency and intensity of such fires may be related to climate change, Exxon\u2019s Jeffers acknowledges, adding, \u201cBut we just don\u2019t know.\u201d)", "Most important, though, #ExxonKnew comes as climate change, after being on a legislative back burner, has gotten hot again. Signs of this include President Obama\u2019s rejection last November of the Keystone pipeline from western Canada, the Paris summit in December that produced an international agreement to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and the U.S.-China plan, finalized on Sept.\u00a03, committing the world\u2019s two largest economies to implement the Paris accords. It\u2019s too soon to say how much of a danger Schneiderman\u2019s investigation poses to Exxon or if the corporation will ever be charged billions of dollars for carbon pollution.

ExxonMobil doesn\u2019t want to become the Philip Morris of climate liability.", "\u00a0", " Frumhoff traces its roots to January\u00a02007. That\u2019s when the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit, published a 64-page report alleging that Exxon used the cigarette industry\u2019s tactics to \u201cmanufacture uncertainty on climate change.\u201d Founded in 1969 by physicists worried about nuclear issues, the UCS has branched out over the years. Frumhoff, a 59-year-old Ph.D. ecologist, serves as its director for science and policy. He dresses in grad-school casual and seems highly amused by Exxon\u2019s notion that he\u2019s a central player in a conspiracy against the company. For starters, Frumhoff is a snap to track down and operates quite openly\u2014violations of the conspirator\u2019s imperative to plot in secret.", "The 2007 report, which Frumhoff oversaw, compared Exxon to cigarette manufacturers that only five months earlier had been found liable by a U.S. district judge for violating the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). \u201cExxonMobil has underwritten the most sophisticated and successful disinformation campaign since Big Tobacco misled the public about the incontrovertible scientific evidence linking smoking to lung cancer and heart disease,\u201d the report asserted.", "With a relatively modest expenditure of $16\u00a0million from 1998 to 2005, Exxon helped fund a network of some 40\u00a0advocacy organizations that raised doubts about the growing scientific consensus that global warming is caused by carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping emissions, the UCS found. Exxon, Frumhoff says, is \u201csort of the poster child for combining a very large contribution to the [climate] problem with an arrogant organizational culture and a significant investment in disinformation to avoid regulation.\u201d", "The idea of \u201cmaking oil the next tobacco\u201d percolated quietly for several years and reemerged in June\u00a02012 in sunny La\u00a0Jolla, Calif., Frumhoff says. It was there that he co-convened a meeting of scientists and lawyers who discussed not only the parallels between fossil fuels and cigarettes, but also the method used to wound tobacco: the amassing via litigation of internal corporate documents showing that cigarette companies concealed the hazards of smoking. \u201cSimilar documents may well exist in the vaults of the fossil fuel industry and their trade associations and front groups,\u201d an online report summarizing the La\u00a0Jolla meeting stated. Even \u201ca single sympathetic state attorney general might have substantial success in bringing key internal documents to light.\u201d", "Several more years passed before a passel of climate documents surfaced, not courtesy of a prosecutor\u2019s subpoena, but as a result of journalistic digging: those reports in ", " (21,000\u00a0words in length) and the ", ". The two organizations reported that after accumulating climate knowledge for a decade or so, Exxon changed course beginning in the late 1980s, just as public debate over greenhouse gas emissions heated up.", "By the 1990s, top Exxon executives were publicly raising doubts about the sorts of findings the company\u2019s own scientists had made. In October\u00a01997, Lee Raymond, then Exxon\u2019s CEO, said in a speech in Beijing, \u201cLet\u2019s agree there\u2019s a lot we really don\u2019t know about how climate will change in the 21st century and beyond.\u201d Arguing against the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an early attempt to forge an international agreement on emission reductions, he added, \u201cIt is highly unlikely that the temperature in the middle of the next century will be significantly affected whether policies are enacted now or 20\u00a0years from now.\u201d", "Working separately from ", ", the ", " showed how Exxon incorporated climate change projections into its Arctic exploration plans in the 1990s while publicly undermining such projections.", "The overlapping investigative journalism efforts appeared as delegations from countries around the world were getting ready for the December climate talks in Paris. On the sidelines of the Paris summit, McKibben, the author-activist, co-hosted a mock trial of Exxon in which he served as a prosecutor. \u201cThis is not just some run-of-the-mill, usual corporate malfeasance,\u201d McKibben said at the trial. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a set of corporate practices that could have done more damage.\u201d Exxon, needless to say, was found guilty.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", " fall and winter in a largely reactive mode, scrambling to respond to each new revelation or congressional request for an investigation\u2014and never succeeding in offering an alternative narrative. \u201cIt was like playing whack-a-mole,\u201d spokesman Jeffers says.", "Seeking to illustrate how ", " \u201ccherry-picked\u201d evidence, the company\u2019s communications team pointed ", " to a half-dozen alleged examples. One focused on the site\u2019s account of the late James Black, the Exxon scientist who told management in 1977 of the \u201cgeneral scientific agreement\u201d about man-made global warming. Exxon accused the publication of failing to include qualifications feathered into Black\u2019s work, such as his noting that \u201ca number of assumptions and uncertainties are involved in the predictions of the greenhouse effect.\u201d But ", " did prominently note that Black\u2019s \u201cpresentations reflected uncertainty running through scientific circles about the details of climate change.\u201d Exxon also accused the organization of erroneously asserting that the company had \u201cstopped\u201d doing carbon research in the late 1980s. But ", " had written, correctly, that the company \u201ccurtailed\u201d its in-house research program during that period.

Rockefeller created Standard Oil, the corporate forerunner of Exxon\u2014the Rockefeller charities in recent years have taken strong stands against the fossil fuel industry.

Lieu, the California Democrat seeking federal investigations, is still shaking his head over a November visit from four Exxon emissaries. The lobbyists handed out a 10-page presentation titled ", ", which sought to underscore the company\u2019s carbon-reduction bona fides. \u201cIt was a really surreal meeting,\u201d Lieu says. The lobbyists \u201ccame in and said, \u2018We believe in climate change and that it\u2019s being caused by humans, and we support a carbon tax.\u2019 I thought to myself, Where is this coming from?

In 2007, Exxon began cutting off funding for some nonprofits that deny widely accepted science on global warming. The company in 2009 for the first time endorsed a tax on carbon emissions, a stance vehemently opposed by Republicans in Congress and therefore dead on arrival on Capitol Hill. At the Exxon annual meeting in Dallas in May, the silver-haired Tillerson went out of his way to tell shareholders that \u201cthe risks of climate change are serious and they do warrant thoughtful action.\u201d", "Strictly speaking, though, #ExxonKnew isn\u2019t a campaign aimed at what the company is saying or doing today. #ExxonKnew focuses on discrepancies between past actions and past statements.

Schneiderman, the host, says he organized the event simply to educate fellow state officials about his Exxon investigation. At the news conference, he sounded like he\u2019d already decided to take the company to court: With \u201cmorally vacant forces\u201d blocking climate action in Washington, he said, states were obliged to devise \u201ccreative ways to enforce laws being flouted by the fossil fuel industry.\u201d", "Schneiderman also arranged for private briefings for the visiting AGs. These closed-door sessions featured a talk on climate science by Frumhoff and a legal backgrounder by Matt Pawa, a private plaintiffs\u2019 attorney who in 2013 won a $236\u00a0million groundwater-pollution verdict against Exxon. The company\u2019s public-affairs representatives see great significance in Pawa\u2019s also having attended Frumhoff\u2019s 2012 gathering in La Jolla. \u201cYou see the same people showing up at planning meetings over the years,\u201d Jeffers says. Schneiderman says he doesn\u2019t know anything about the La Jolla session and that his office routinely consults with outside experts.", "A more consequential aspect of the prosecutors\u2019 conclave was the announcement by the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Claude Walker, that his tiny Caribbean territory had launched a parallel investigation of Exxon. In theory, the Virgin Islands has ample reason to be anxious about climate change: Warming, rising ocean waters could swamp its homes and resorts in coming decades. But in practice, the territory proved itself inadequate to the task of confronting Exxon.", "In March the Virgin Islands issued a sprawling, loosely worded subpoena that demanded the company\u2019s correspondence with scores of conservative and free-market organizations, including FreedomWorks, the Heartland Institute, and the Heritage Foundation. In a separate subpoena, it sought documents directly from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning group that\u2019s cast doubt on mainstream climate science and formerly received financial support from Exxon. This focus on communication opened the door for Exxon\u2019s New York law firm, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, to seek to kill the islands\u2019 subpoenas on First Amendment grounds. Paul Weiss filed court papers in Texas on April\u00a013 condemning the Virgin Islands\u2019 attempt \u201cto deter ExxonMobil from participating in ongoing public deliberations about climate change.\u201d (The more precisely tailored New York subpoena didn\u2019t explicitly name nonprofits with which Exxon may have communicated.)", "Finally, Exxon had its counterpunch: that hostile outsiders had attacked the company\u2019s free-speech rights. There\u2019s a reason Theodore Wells, the Paul Weiss partner who\u2019s led Exxon\u2019s legal defense (and has represented such clients as Philip Morris), is known as one of the craftiest people in his profession. However unlikely the image of Exxon as victim, that\u2019s how Wells decided to characterize his client\u2014and it worked. On April\u00a022, the ", " carried two opinion pieces on the topic: a column by George Will headlined \u201cScientific Silencers on the Left Are Trying to Shut Down Climate Skepticism\u201d and one by Sam Kazman and Kent Lassman, respectively general counsel and president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, condemning \u201cthe environmental campaign that punishes free speech.\u201d In the following days, dozens of similar broadsides were issued from the ", " editorial page, Fox News, the Heritage Foundation, and many others.", "Once again, politicians followed. In mid-May, the House Committee on Science, Space, & Technology began investigating what it called \u201ca coordinated attempt to deprive companies, nonprofit organizations, and scientists of their First Amendment rights.\u201d The only company the panel mentioned by name was Exxon. Committee staff members and Exxon\u2019s McCarron say that despite the company\u2019s widespread lobbying of Congress, it didn\u2019t ask the panel or its chairman, Lamar Smith (R-Texas), to begin the probe. First elected in 1986, Smith has received almost $685,000 in career campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. By early July, the Virgin Islands had turned tail and withdrawn its subpoenas of Exxon and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Trying to put the best spin on his humiliating retreat, Virgin Islands AG Walker said via e-mail that extricating itself from the subpoena imbroglio will allow his office to \u201cuse our limited resources to address the many other issues that face the Virgin Islands and its residents.\u201d Wells didn\u2019t respond to requests for\u00a0comment.", "Schneiderman now finds himself under investigation, too. When the New York AG\u2019s office refused to cooperate with the science committee, Smith issued subpoenas to Schneiderman; Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who\u2019d launched her own investigation of Exxon; and eight nongovernmental organizations, including the Rockefeller funds, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and 350.org. \u201cUnfortunately, the attorneys general have refused to give the committee the information to which it is entitled,\u201d Smith told reporters on July\u00a013. \u201cWhat are they hiding and why?\u201d", "\u00a0", " inquiries evoke 1950s-era communist hunting by the House Un-American Activities Committee: \u201cThey have no evidence of any cabal, no evidence of any misconduct.\u201d As for the science panel\u2019s concern about Exxon\u2019s First Amendment rights, Schneiderman says the federal government\u2019s successful RICO case against the tobacco companies made \u201cvery clear that the First Amendment doesn\u2019t give you the right to commit fraud.\u201d", "If Schneiderman continues to resist the House committee\u2019s document demands, the confrontation could end up in court\u2014a\u00a0fight the New York official sounds eager to have. He\u2019d have an excellent chance of winning, too. It\u2019s unusual for a congressional panel to interfere with a pending state investigation, says Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a former federal prosecutor who advocates putting Exxon under a microscope. Smith \u201cis trying to subvert the power of state government [and] do something he is not entitled to do under any kind of discovery rules,\u201d Whitehouse says. More succinctly, Peter Shane, a law professor at Ohio State University, says, \u201cCongress has no authority over the conduct of state law enforcement.\u201d", "Exxon, for its part, has been cooperating with Schneiderman\u2019s subpoena because the company\u2019s lawyers at Paul Weiss advised their client that it had no choice, according to a person familiar with the situation. Schneiderman is investigating under the broad provisions of a 1921 state law called the Martin Act, arguably the most potent securities-fraud statute in the country. Named for sponsor Louis Martin, an otherwise-forgotten state assemblyman, the law forbids \u201cany fraud, deception, concealment, suppression, [or] false pretense.\u201d Crucially, it doesn\u2019t require a prosecutor to demonstrate that a defendant consciously intended to defraud investors or regulators. New York\u2019s top court has interpreted it to cover \u201call deceitful practices contrary to the plain rules of common honesty.\u201d", "Schneiderman doesn\u2019t have a slam-dunk case. \u201cThe New York attorney general has a plausible theory, but he\u2019ll need more than the results of the journalistic investigations,\u201d says Michael Gerrard, a law professor at Columbia who directs the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to show that Exxon had internal knowledge of climate change when external knowledge was widespread. The government would have to show that there were things that only Exxon knew and that were material to investors and that Exxon kept from investors. Such evidence might be there, but we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d", "One potential defense that Exxon is floating: Since the 1970s its scientists have published climate findings in more than 50\u00a0peer-reviewed articles. What Exxon knew, the argument would go, the wider scientific world also knew. The company didn\u2019t keep secrets the way the tobacco industry did.", "Few complicated securities-fraud cases go to trial; the risk of losing and the costs of extended litigation impel settlement. With those risks in mind, Exxon and New York may eventually look to a separate case resolved by Schneiderman\u2019s office in November. The attorney general found after a two-year investigation that coal producer Peabody Energy provided incomplete information to investors by saying in public reports that it couldn\u2019t \u201creasonably predict\u201d the risks it faced from climate-related regulations. St. Louis-based Peabody, which in April declared bankruptcy amid a collapsing coal market, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing and didn\u2019t face pecuniary punishment. The company did agree to provide more forthcoming disclosures to investors.", "\u201cIt\u2019s really too soon to tell\u201d whether the Peabody settlement provides a model for the Exxon case, Schneiderman says. He expects to amass evidence in the Exxon investigation of \u201ca much more sophisticated ongoing policy of deception\u201d than what his office found inside Peabody\u2014wrongdoing that could warrant seeking substantial money damages. Exxon has kept that alleged policy in place through recent years, Schneiderman says, pointing to a 2014 company report claiming that international efforts to reduce climate change wouldn\u2019t oblige fossil fuel producers to leave enormous amounts of oil in the ground untouched.", "Exxon denies any deception took place and isn\u2019t ready to talk settlement, McCarron says. She calls Schneiderman\u2019s comments \u201can attack on the integrity of the company\u201d and says Exxon \u201cwill pursue all available legal options to defend ourselves.\u201d", "\u00a0"]},

That step is further out for its counterparts in Europe and Japan, though central banks in both places are seen scaling back their bond buying next year. After the three central banks cumulatively bulked up their balance sheets to more than $14 trillion, the unwind has the potential to influence a slew of markets, from stocks and bonds to currencies and even real estate.", "As with all balance sheets, there are assets and liabilities. Where a regular bank counts its loans as its main assets, the Fed, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have government bonds, among other securities. On the liabilities side, instead of deposits from individuals and companies like at commercial banks, central banks have the cash deposits of commercial banks themselves. Also on the liabilities side: banknotes, which are effectively promissory notes from the central bank. The Fed\u2019s and BOJ\u2019s liabilities include their respective governments\u2019 cash deposits (which come, for example, from tax revenue).", "Through quantitative easing, or QE, programs, central banks bought government bonds and other securities, inflating the asset side of the balance sheet. They created money to pay regular banks for those securities, and those funds then were deposited at the central banks -- inflating the liability side by equal amounts.", "Say that one of the government bonds the Fed had bought matures. The Treasury \"pays\" for it through a reduction in its deposits at the Fed. The asset side of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet shrinks by the amount of the Treasury note, and the liability side declines by the same amount. Unless the federal government raises additional revenue or cuts spending, the U.S. Treasury will need to replace the note that just matured by\u00a0selling another one to the commercial banks that act as intermediaries for investors. When that happens, commercial-bank reserves at the Fed decline and the Treasury\u2019s cash balance rises. In other words, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has now contracted, as have the funds commercial banks can use to lend to businesses and home buyers.", "This has come up in Japan, which has the world\u2019s biggest government debt burden. Say the government swapped some of the bonds the central bank has for a new note that never expires -- so never needs to be paid off -- and has no interest payments. The government would now be free of the burden. But that hasn\u2019t changed anything on the liability side for the central bank. Remember, it created reserves at commercial banks to pay for the government bonds at the beginning. That money is still there. And, as the economy reflates and interest rates go up, it will have to pay more interest on that money. So there\u2019s no free lunch -- if the government doesn\u2019t pay, the central bank will have to.", "They are classified as a liability, though they have no maturity or ongoing cost to the central bank once they\u2019re printed. Theoretically, if consumer demand for banknotes climbed, then commercial banks would exchange their reserves at the central bank for banknotes. And if that happened, the public sector -- the government plus central banks -- could escape paying interest on the liabilities previously created. However, banknotes already make up a higher share of money than has historically been the case, so the demand for them would be unlikely to surge. And if inflation picks up as central banks anticipate, the real value of banknotes will decline. Again, no free lunch: Either the government or central bank pays interest, or citizens pay with less valuable banknotes.", "This is the big debate. It all depends on the condition of the economy, the effectiveness of policy makers\u2019 communication and the deftness of their execution. In May 2013, then-Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke surprised investors when he said the central bank could start phasing out its QE later that year -- a warning that sent U.S. Treasuries, emerging-market stocks and currencies tumbling in the so-called taper tantrum. By contrast, Fed officials have given the markets plenty of advance notice about its plans to contract the balance sheet, which economists expect to begin ", ", and it\u2019s hard to detect any effects so far. But this is uncharted territory, so it\u2019s tough to predict how markets will react as central banks exit.", "Emerging markets have been big beneficiaries of the central banks\u2019 bond-buying sprees in recent years. Deutsche Bank AG analysts calculated that for every $100 increase in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, some $15 ended up in Asian equity and debt markets. So with potentially trillions of dollars of contraction to come, emerging markets could get roiled again, as they did in 2013, when Indonesia\u2019s rupiah tumbled more than 20 percent and within several weeks premiums on emerging-nation bonds soared by over a percentage point and their equities slid more than 15 percent. In the U.S., a jump in borrowing costs could cause a retrenchment in everything from home sales to car purchases. And perhaps the biggest danger: Without regular and massive central bank bond purchases, there\u2019s less of a shock absorber if something happens that sparks turmoil."]},

As one of its most respected figures, Stewart\u00a0spent the week jetting around the U.K. to promote it. He\u00a0made a rare podium speech during the DCS Compendium\u2019s splashy launch party at the Wallace Collection in central London before taking a private jet back to the distillery to glad-hand a series of VIPs, including\u00a0Atlanta-based collector Mahesh Patel, who were invited to learn the story behind Stewart\u2019s five-figure farewell.", "Which brings us back to Dufftown, where Stewart continues his preview. Steering the tasting with a few gentle, nudging words and a small jug passing around to cut the spirit (Stewart is a firm believer in opening up flavor with a drop or two of tepid water), he has moved on from that citrus-y whisky from \"Chapter Five\" and is eying another glass. It forms part of \"Expect the Unexpected\"(The only thing inauthentic about these groupings is the surfeit of marketing-speak that muddles their titles.)", "\u201cChapter Four, now that was the most difficult,\u201d he says, explaining how he built the collection by exploring the forgotten recesses of the Balvenie\u2019s vaults. Poring over records, he would look for an experimental barrel or two from years past, perhaps one in which he finished some liquid in a different way. Such is the case with the whisky he is eyeballing now in that new snifter. \u201cWe\u2019d done an end treatment\u2014something we rarely do\u2014but it gave us a coconut style of Balvenie. But that was just one cask.\u201d He pauses. \u201cTo pull together five casks, we probably sample hundreds.\u201d", "\u00a0", "Picture, then, the painstaking process of building that 25-strong assortment, as Stewart\u00a0sifted through the vast archive of barrels that the Balvenie holds in its vaults. He tasted and tested hundreds, even thousands, to whittle down the selection to barely two dozen, each a single-cask single malt. In other words, each bottle contains whisky that is unblended and taken from a unique barrel.\u00a0", "Few distilleries or malt masters could credibly produce such a selection. The Balvenie is one of few distilleries to maintain its processes largely unchanged since it first eked out some distillate in spring 1893. The Balvenie still grows its own barley\u2014even in October, a field has yet to be harvested\u2014and it\u2019s one of barely half a dozen in the industry that employs the floor-malting process (a hands-on drying process to ready barley for fermentation), rather than simply buying ready, prepped barley from commercial malters.", "The Balvenie is an outlier in other ways, too: It has a full-time coppersmith to mend and tend the stills (Dennis McBain, who started here as an apprentice in 1959) and an onsite, wholly owned cooperage, at which pallets of barrels await inspection by the workshop\u2019s head. (Stewart says head cooper Ian McDonald has been working onsite for less than 46 years, making McDonald\u00a0a comparative whippersnapper.)", "The most compelling ingredient in the DCS, though, is Stewart himself, at least according to Becky Paskin, who edits ", ", an\u00a0industry site.", "\u201c[Stewart] has dedicated his life to making whisky with this one company,\u201d she raves, citing him as one of the industry\u2019s landmark innovators. It was Stewart, Paskin explains, who first marketed a cask-finished single malt in the early 1990s, the Double Wood brand; it has become an industry-wide expression and one of the Balvenie\u2019s own top-sellers. (When pressed, Stewart\u00a0admits to some pride over the idea: \u201cNow, that\u2019s what I\u2019m proudest of at Balvenie, the idea I had of transferring whisky from American to European oak to see what would happen.\u201d)", "Other companies have tried super-premium launches, too.

But Becky Paskin doesn\u2019t discount Stewart\u2019s $50,000 Compendium. She calls it a smart buy. The Balvenie is \u201cthe most-liked geek in the school,\u201d the easily overlooked over-performer among the major whisky brands, she says. \u201cAnd the liquid itself is spectacular\u2014every single individual bottle has merits of its own, and the set really conveys the distillery characteristics: That fruity, green Speyside character even comes through in the 46-year-old, where the barrel would normally have taken over the flavor.\u201d", "Paskin points out that a rare bottle of whisky from the 1960s can easily fetch around \u00a319,000 ($30,000). Since the first Compendium chapter includes a 1968 cask packaged as a collectible, with four other handpicked barrels (1978, 1985, 1997, and 2005), it\u2019s a relative\u00a0bargain.", "The DCS quintet is also a smart investment, given how rapidly speculation on the water of life ", " since the first stand-alone auctions were held in Glasgow 15 years ago. A newly launched online platform, ", ", even allows collectors to trade. Thanks to its rarity and romantic provenance as Stewart\u2019s final collection, the DCS Compendium is likely to quickly skyrocket in value among whisky traders.", "Much of that value derives from the self-effacing Stewart. He says that working for five decades on whisky has taught him a major lesson: \u201cPatience. I can\u2019t honestly say I\u2019m a very patient person in other things, but you can\u2019t rush a whisky experiment.\u201d"]},

Its position on a bend of the Thames provides unparalleled views of London in all directions, and its amenities, including a 35th-story lounge with an infinity pool, an entire floor devoted to recreation rooms, and even an outdoor covered track, would\u00a0place it at the (literal) top of London\u2019s booming luxury real estate.", "And then, just as the building broke ground, the U.K. voted to leave the European Union\u00a0and London\u2019s real estate market, which had already been showing signs of weakness, ", ".", "The Greenland Group vowed to forge ahead with the building. \u201cThe UK\u2019s vote to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) cannot be said to have had no effect on the property market in London, and we are aware that there could be some turbulence in the future,\" wrote\u00a0Wenhao Qian, managing director of Greenland Investment Ltd., in an e-mail. \"Developments of note, as well as iconic buildings, are continuing to do well. \u00a0We feel that the advantages of London\u2014its global cachet, cosmopolitanism and being a centre of world trade\u2014bode well for a positive future for both the property market and the wider economy.\u201d", "The question, in turn, is whether Greenland's\u00a0commitment represents canny long-term planning or something closer to stoicism in the face of adversity.", "\u00a0", "First, said ", ", head of research at the broker,\u00a0", ", it\u2019s important to consider the overall London housing market, Brexit or no: \u201cWe\u2019re probably building less than half the supply of housing that the city needs on an annual basis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re constructing about 40,000 to 50,000 new units a year, when we really need about 120,000.\u201d In a vacuum, then, Spire London is adding a much needed supply of apartments (861\u00a0in total) in the face of cacophonous demand.", "But that demand comes with a caveat. \u201cMost domestic [U.K.] demand tends to seek out what we call \u2018period property,\u2019 or anything that isn\u2019t new construction,\u201d Durrani said. \u201cSo despite a building being brand-new and modern and packed with all sorts of amenities, it\u2019s not a kind of place domestic buyers will aspire to live in.\u201d", "Happily for Greenland though, roughly half of all central London buyers are currently international, and many of those buyers \u201care coming from new-build cities,\u201d Durrani said. \u201cSo new buildings appeal to them\u2014 they\u2019re used to it.\u201d More good news for the Greenland Group: A recent\u00a0Cluttons survey of 127 UAE-based high-net-worth individuals listed Canary Wharf as the top neighborhood for residential investment, which Durrani said could be the result of a\u00a0massive influx of investment into the neighborhood from sovereign wealth funds. Investors \u201chave seen their government has identified a safe space, and they\u2019re going along with it,\u201d he explained.", "Still, the recent volatility in the U.K.\u00a0housing market has caused some international investors to sell (at least, attempt to sell) their\u00a0London properties. \"What's happened, with values softening over most of the city, is that we've seen some international buyers trying to offload their stock,\" Durrani said. \"There's very little domestic interest in purchasing it because it's perceived to be overpriced.\" And, Durrani added, \"it often is overpriced.\" If economic volatility\u2014not to mention Britain's exit from the E.U.\u2014continues, that could eventually further dampen international interest.", "The final factor that could affect the Spire's success? Time. As the U.K.\u2019s domestic buying base grows (and ages), there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019ll come around to this new, glassy construction. \u201cThe cookie-cutter mentality hasn\u2019t arrived yet for domestic buyers, but over time I think that\u2019s likely to change,\u201d Durrani said. \u201cPurely because there aren\u2019t enough homes to go around. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d", "In the short term, Spire London can hope to attract\u00a0international buyers confident in London's future as a financial center, or at least in its position as a city more stable than those in their home country. In a\u00a0mid- to long-range outlook, demographic indicators imply that its buyers could come from within the U.K.", "Malcic, the architect at HOK, said the building was designed with just this sort of change in mind. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to appeal to a whole range of people,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will be equally appealing to people in the home counties whose children have grown up, who don\u2019t want to spend time cutting the grass anymore.\u201d", "Malcic said that HOK\u00a0accounted for this uncertain future with\u00a0malleable tech configurations (\u201cWhat people need is not built-in tech anymore,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat they need is the flexibility to put in whatever technology is coming\"), extra-high ceilings (\u201cwhich gives a graciousness, but also a degree of flexibility,\u201d) and\u00a0such amenities as refrigerated storage lockers to stash\u00a0grocery deliveries. \u201cIn the old days, you measured success by how much square feet you had,\" he said. \"Now it\u2019s how much convenience you have.\"", "Construction is set to begin in early 2017, with a completion date of 2020. And while the Brexit uncertainty and U.S. elections roiling world markets make it impossible to make even a reasonably cautious prediction about the future, Durrani, the analyst, said that smart investors shouldn't try.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s harder than ever to time a building launch with property market cycles,\" he said. \"Most investors in this market are in it for the long term, and the long-term picture is a lot rosier than the next three to six months.\""]},
