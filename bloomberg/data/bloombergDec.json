In the horizontal kind, a company buys one of its competitors. Imagine if Toyota Motor Corp. bought General Motors Co., or Apple Inc. acquired Samsung Electronics Co. These are the types of deals that have raised antitrust worries in the past. Vertical deals, on the other hand, unite companies that operate at different levels of production or distribution, as is the case with AT&T and Time Warner.

These deals don\u2019t increase concentration in an industry because they don\u2019t combine head-to-head rivals.", "They potentially give an acquirer market power, depending on the shape of the industry. By taking out a competitor, the buyer may be able to raise prices on its own or in coordination with the remaining players. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have successfully challenged many of these types of deals. For example, the Justice Department in early 2017 stopped two health-insurance mergers -- Anthem Inc.\u2019s proposed takeover of Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc.\u2019s deal with Humana Inc.", "In theory, they can make a company more efficient by giving it cost advantages over rivals.

When Comcast Corp. bought NBCUniversal in 2011 -- a vertical deal that united Comcast\u2019s distribution with NBCUniversal\u2019s content -- Comcast agreed to dozens of conditions. Many had to do with content-licensing to address the government\u2019s ", " that Comcast would be able to harm online-video rivals like Netflix Inc. or Amazon.com Inc. by raising the cost of NBCUniversal content or withholding it altogether.

It has the potential to reshape how Americans receive health care by uniting CVS\u2019s pharmacies and drop-in clinics with an insurer.

(While the legislation would take effect in the new year, it won\u2019t be reflected in your tax forms until the 2019 tax season).", "So, here are suggestions from accountants, financial planners, and other tax experts on how to make the most\u00a0of this opportunity. Keep in mind that the best advice depends specifically on how you\u2019re going to be affected by the tax bill.\u00a0While most Americans would get a tax cut in the short term, some taxpayers could\u00a0see higher tax bills in 2018.\u00a0\u201cNo individual is average,\u201d\u00a0Suzanne Shier, a tax strategist at Northern Trust Corp., reminds us. \u201cAn average is a composite of multiple individuals.\u201d", "If your taxes are set to spike in 2018, many of these strategies won\u2019t work as well.

Deductions claimed for things you did this year will\u00a0lower tax bills due the following April. Wait until January,\u00a0and you\u2019ll need to cool your heels for more than a year to get the benefit of deductions claimed.", "This year, beefing up your charitable giving could be even\u00a0more effective. If your tax rate is falling in 2018, your deductions are more valuable if claimed against this year\u2019s\u00a0income. Giving to charity, a tax deduction that\u2019s preserved under the tax bill,\u00a0is an effective way to boost your 2017 deductions on short notice.", "And even if your tax rate is going up next year under the new bill, you may still want to make a bunch of charitable donations in 2017. Most deductions, including the charitable one, can only be claimed if you itemize your tax return. The bill would sharply limit the number of taxpayers who would benefit from itemizing: First it\u00a0raises\u00a0the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for single people, and $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. Second, it limits other deductions\u2014most famously for state and local taxes\u2014so it\u2019s harder for taxpayers to reach the threshold where itemizing makes sense.", "So,\u00a0you might want to think about making\u00a0several years of charitable donations this month if you can afford it, said Philip \u201cRusty\u201d Ross, a financial adviser at Exencial Wealth Advisors based in Oklahoma City. If you\u2019re not sure where to donate, you can open a donor-advised fund and decide later where your money will go. But move fast\u2014there are only two weeks left in December.", "Another traditional recommendation for this time of year\u00a0is to defer income. While salaried workers generally can\u2019t choose when they get paid, business owners can often delay registering\u00a0income until the following year, lowering their April tax bill\u00a0in the process. Investors can also control their taxable income\u2014and thus lower capital\u00a0gains tax bills\u2014by selling losing stocks\u00a0or\u00a0waiting to sell winning stocks until 2018.\u00a0In most years, deferring income merely delays the taxes you will have to pay eventually. But, if you expect your tax rate to fall next year, deferring income into 2018 could actually save you money. (There\u2019s also some good news for equity investors ", ".)", "As we noted, the tax bill would limit how much state and local taxes (or SALT) individuals can deduct, to no more than $10,000 of a combination\u00a0of property taxes and either income or sales taxes. The move by the Republican-controlled Congress was criticized by Democrats as an effort to\u00a0make citizens of high-tax blue states pay for benefits to\u00a0corporations and\u00a0citizens of low-tax red states.\u00a0As a result, advisers had been planning to instruct\u00a0clients targeted by this provision to find ways to maximize their SALT deduction in 2017, by pre-paying\u00a0next year\u2019s taxes as much as allowed and deducting them\u00a0under the old rules. But the final compromise bill, unveiled Friday by Republicans in the Senate and House,\u00a0explicitly closes this loophole with respect to income taxes. Any\u00a02018 state and local income taxes paid ahead of time would nevertheless need to be\u00a0counted on next year\u2019s taxes, according to the bill. However, taxpayers\u00a0could still pre-pay property taxes due in 2018, and deduct them under the old rules. Additionally, any taxes due for 2017\u2014or any late\u00a0taxes from previous years\u2014could still be deducted on a tax return due this April.", "Current tax law allows employees to deduct unreimbursed\u00a0expenses related to their jobs\u00a0as long as they\u2019re more than 2 percent of income. The tax bill ends these itemized deductions after the end of this\u00a0year. So, workers should think about whether they can pay \u2014and get the receipts\u2014for as many\u00a0of these expenses as possible this month, said Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block in Kansas City, Missouri. Examples of unreimbursed expenses for employees might include tools and supplies, occupational taxes, work uniforms, union dues, and expenses for work-related travel. Self-employed people and business owners would still be able to deduct expenses under the new tax bill.\u00a0", "Under the proposed law, you\u2019ll no longer be allowed to deduct work-related moving expenses after the new year (unless you\u2019re in the military). Of course it might be difficult to schedule a cross-country move on such short notice, but, \u201cif you did move, make sure you clear up any moving-related expenses by Dec. 31,\u201d said Fordham University accounting and taxation professor Stanley Veliotis.
