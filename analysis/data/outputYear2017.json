They support increasing the number of bitcoin transactions in each block. Second are the so-called Core developers who have been instrumental in constructing bitcoin\u2019s bug-proof system. Their proposal:\u00a0Allow some data to be moved outside the main network, in effect creating multiple ledgers called sidechains.

Then, in November, bitcoin will face its next big challenge when some of the world\u2019s biggest miners move to adopt phase two, the doubling of the size of the block.

One attraction is that, in contrast to limitless printed currencies, there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins.

ICOs may seem to fall into a legal gray area, but she says the vast majority of tokens count as securities, and if they are sold to investors in the U.S., they fall under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. A legal standard called the Howey Test defines an investment contract as a security if you are putting money into a common enterprise with an expectation of profit, primarily from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. The SEC has yet to wade in, but the hotter the ICO market, the greater the potential for abuse or investor losses that could spur the agency to act. Channing suspects the regulators are waiting for the right case. Meeting requirements for a securities sale will mean selling ICOs to accredited investors with a certain level of sophistication and assets.", "The eye-popping gains on coins are drawing more attention to them, a classic precondition of a bubble.

In my remarks today I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy.", "Current Economic Situation and Outlook", "Since my appearance before this Committee last June, the economy has continued to make progress toward our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In the labor market, job gains averaged 190,000 per month over the second half of 2016, and the number of jobs rose an additional 227,000 in January. Those gains bring the total increase in employment since its trough in early 2010 to nearly 16 million. In addition, the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.8 percent in January, is more than 5 percentage points lower than where it stood at its peak in 2010 and is now in line with the median of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants\u2019 estimates of its longer-run normal level. A broader measure of labor underutilization, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force and people who are working part time but would like a full-time job, has also continued to improve over the past year. In addition, the pace of wage growth has picked up relative to its pace of a few years ago, a further indication that the job market is tightening. Importantly, improvements in the labor market in recent years have been widespread, with large declines in the unemployment rates for all major demographic groups, including African Americans and Hispanics. Even so, it is discouraging that jobless rates for those minorities remain significantly higher than the rate for the nation overall.", "Ongoing gains in the labor market have been accompanied by a further moderate expansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have risen 1.9 percent last year, the same as in 2015. Consumer spending has continued to rise at a healthy pace, supported by steady income gains, increases in the value of households\u2019 financial assets and homes, favorable levels of consumer sentiment, and low interest rates. Last year\u2019s sales of automobiles and light trucks were the highest annual total on record. In contrast, business investment was relatively soft for much of last year, though it posted some larger gains toward the end of the year in part reflecting an apparent end to the sharp declines in spending on drilling and mining structures; moreover, business sentiment has noticeably improved in the past few months. In addition, weak foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have restrained manufacturing output. Meanwhile, housing construction has continued to trend up at only a modest pace in recent quarters. And, while the lean stock of homes for sale and ongoing labor market gains should provide some support to housing construction going forward, the recent increases in mortgage rates may impart some restraint.", "Inflation moved up over the past year, mainly because of the diminishing effects of the earlier declines in energy prices and import prices. Total consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ending in December, still below the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective but up 1 percentage point from its pace in 2015. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food prices, moved up to about 1-3/4 percent.", "My colleagues on the FOMC and I expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate pace, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation gradually rising to 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that U.S. monetary policy remains accommodative, and that the pace of global economic activity should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. Of course, our inflation outlook also depends importantly on our assessment that longer-run inflation expectations will remain reasonably well anchored. It is reassuring that while market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low, they have risen from the very low levels they reached during the latter part of 2015 and first half of 2016. Meanwhile, most survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have changed little, on balance, in recent months.", "As always, considerable uncertainty attends the economic outlook. Among the sources of uncertainty are possible changes in U.S. fiscal and other policies, the future path of productivity growth, and developments abroad.", "Monetary Policy", "Turning to monetary policy, the FOMC is committed to promoting maximum employment and price stability, as mandated by the Congress. Against the backdrop of headwinds weighing on the economy over the past year, including financial market stresses that emanated from developments abroad, the Committee maintained an unchanged target range for the federal funds rate for most of the year in order to support improvement in the labor market and an increase in inflation toward 2 percent. At its December meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. In doing so, the Committee recognized the considerable progress the economy had made toward the FOMC\u2019s dual objectives. The Committee judged that even after this increase in the federal funds rate target, monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.", "At its meeting that concluded early this month, the Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged but reiterated that it expects the evolution of the economy to warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain its employment and inflation objectives. As I noted on previous occasions, waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee\u2019s expectations. At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.", "The Committee\u2019s view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate reflects the expectation that the neutral federal funds rate--that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and that keeps the economy operating on an even keel--will rise somewhat over time. Current estimates of the neutral rate are well below pre-crisis levels--a phenomenon that may reflect slow productivity growth, subdued economic growth abroad, strong demand for safe longer-term assets, and other factors. The Committee anticipates that the depressing effect of these factors will diminish somewhat over time, raising the neutral funds rate, albeit to levels that are still low by historical standards.", "That said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by incoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S. fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC\u2019s monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.", "Finally, the Committee has continued its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. This policy, by keeping the Committee\u2019s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, has helped maintain accommodative financial conditions.", "Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions."]},

I strongly believe that my colleagues and I should explain, as clearly as we can, both the reasons for our decisions and the fundamental principles that underlie our strategy.", "Today I will review the conduct of monetary policy during the nearly 10 years since the onset of the financial crisis. Although the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy strategy for systematically pursuing its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability has not changed during this period, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made significant tactical adjustments along the way. I will spend most of my time today discussing the rationale for the adjustments the Committee has made since 2014, a year that I see as a turning point, when the FOMC began to transition from providing increasing amounts of accommodation to gradually scaling it back.", "The process of scaling back accommodation has so far proceeded at a slower pace than most FOMC participants anticipated in", "2014. Both unexpected economic developments and deeper reevaluations of structural trends affecting the U.S. and global economies prompted us to reassess our views on the outlook and associated risks and, consequently, the appropriate stance of monetary policy, both in the near term and the longer run. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the evolution of the economy to warrant further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate. However, given how close we are to meeting our statutory goals, and in the absence of new developments that might materially worsen the economic outlook, the process of scaling back accommodation likely will not be as slow as it was in 2015 and 2016.", "I should note that I will discuss the process of scaling back accommodation mostly from the perspective of our interest rate decisions, which my FOMC colleagues and I see as our primary tool for actively adjusting the stance of monetary policy when our actions are not constrained by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates.1", "1) When the federal funds rate was near zero and we felt the economy still needed more support, the FOMC acted, beginning in 2008, to purchase longer-term securities. Although we stopped increasing the size of our securities portfolio in 2014, we have been reinvesting principal payments from our securities holdings ever since. We have said that we expect to maintain this policy until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. We have also said that, when it becomes appropriate to reduce the size of our balance sheet, we will do so primarily by letting maturing assets run off our balance sheet.", "Assessing the Degree of Monetary Policy Accommodation", "In our monetary policy deliberations, the FOMC always faces two fundamental questions: First, how do we assess the current stance of monetary policy? Second, what are the strategic and tactical considerations that underpin our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy going forward? These questions are difficult because the interactions between monetary policy and the economy are complex. Policy affects the economy through many different channels, and, in turn, many factors influence the appropriate course of policy.", "Gauging the current stance of monetary policy requires arriving at a judgment of what would constitute a neutral policy stance at a given time. A useful concept in this regard is the neutral \"real\" federal funds rate, defined as the level of the federal funds rate that, when adjusted for inflation, is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its potential. In effect, a \"neutral\" policy stance is one where monetary policy neither has its foot on the brake nor is pressing down on the accelerator. Although the concept of the neutral real federal funds rate is exceptionally useful in assessing policy, it is difficult in practical terms to know with precision where that rate stands. As a result, and as I described in a recent speech, my colleagues and I consider a wide range of information when assessing that rate.2", "2) See Yellen (2017).", "As I will discuss, our assessments of the neutral rate have significantly shifted down over the past few years.", "In the Committee\u2019s most recent projections last December, most FOMC participants assessed the longer-run value of the neutral real federal funds rate to be in the vicinity of 1 percent.3", "3) This estimate of the neutral real federal funds rate is based on the difference between the medians of the longer-run projections for the federal funds rate and inflation submitted by individual FOMC participants for the December 2016 FOMC meeting. The most recent Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of that meeting, is available on the Board\u2019s website at ", " ep.htm.", "This level is quite low by historical standards, reflecting, in part, slow productivity growth and an aging population not only in the United States, but also in many advanced economies. Moreover, the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate appears to be even lower than this longer-run value because of several additional headwinds to the U.S. economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, such as subdued economic growth abroad and perhaps a lingering sense of caution on the part of households and businesses in the wake of the trauma of the Great Recession.", "It is difficult to say just how low the current neutral rate is because assessments of the effect of post-recession headwinds on the current level of the neutral real rate are subject to a great deal of uncertainty. Some recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero percent.4", "4) See, for instance, Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016).", "With the actual value of the real federal funds rate currently near minus 1 percent, a near-zero estimate of the neutral real rate means that the stance of monetary policy remains moderately accommodative, an assessment that is consistent with the fact that employment has been growing at a pace--around 180,000 net new jobs per month--that is notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth-- between 75,000 and 125,000 per month. 5", "5 As I will explain, this policy stance seems appropriate given that the underlying trend in inflation appears to be still running somewhat below 2 percent. But as that gap closes, with labor market conditions now in the vicinity of our maximum employment objective, the Committee considers it appropriate to move toward a neutral policy stance.", "My colleagues and I generally anticipate that the neutral real federal funds rate will rise to its longer-run level over the next few years. This expectation partly underlies our view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in the months and years ahead: Those increases would keep the economy from significantly overheating, thereby sustaining the expansion and maintaining price stability.", "Post-Crisis Period: Same Strategy, New Tactics", "I will now examine the strategic and tactical considerations that go into FOMC deliberations by discussing past monetary policy decisions in the context of our mandate from the Congress to pursue maximum employment and price stability.", "The FOMC\u2019s monetary policy strategy is based on three basic principles. First, our monetary policy must be goal driven. We must take care to ensure that our decisions over time are consistent with our commitment to achieve the Federal Reserve\u2019s congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, and that the public understands and has confidence in that commitment. Second, our monetary policy must be forward looking because our decisions tend to influence economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag. Among other things, this implies looking through short-term and transitory developments and focusing on the medium-term outlook--roughly two or three years out--when making policy decisions. Third, our monetary policy must be risk sensitive. Because the outlook is uncertain, we must assess appropriate policy with an eye toward the risk that our expectations about the economy turn out to be significantly wrong.", "We have followed this basic strategy for decades and, in 2012, the FOMC formalized it in our \"Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.\"6", "6) The Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board\u2019s website at ", " nGoals.pdf.", "The Committee has reaffirmed this commitment annually. But the challenges brought about by the financial crisis, and the very deep recession and painfully slow recovery that followed, compelled us to adjust our tactics for carrying out our policy strategy. In particular, once the Committee had cut the federal funds rate to near zero in late 2008, it became necessary to deploy new tools to supply the considerable monetary accommodation required by the extremely weak state of the job market and persistently low inflation.7", "7)See Yellen (2016).", "Those tools--especially our large-scale securities purchases and increasingly explicit forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of the federal funds rate--enabled the Federal Reserve to provide necessary additional support to the U.S. economy by pushing down longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally.", "Much has been written and said already about the provision of additional accommodation between 2008 and 2014, when the FOMC completed its latest round of large-scale securities purchases, so I will turn now to our policy stance since 2014, when the FOMC\u2019s main focus started to shift from providing additional accommodation to scaling it back. 8", "8) For a discussion of our monetary policy during the 2008-14 period, see, for instance, Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).", "2014: A Turning Point for Monetary Policy", "By late 2013, the FOMC concluded that the economy had made sufficient progress, and the outlook was sufficiently favorable, that it should reduce the pace of its large-scale securities purchases. But we reiterated that these purchases would continue until the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially. The U.S. economy made notable progress toward the FOMC\u2019s statutory goals during 2014, with the unemployment rate dropping to close to 6 percent by mid-year--well below its Great-Recession peak of 10 percent--and other measures of labor market conditions also showing improvement: Payroll gains were solid; job openings had risen significantly; and the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs--a sign of confidence in the labor market--was rising back toward pre-crisis levels. We were also seeing progress on achieving our price stability goal: Total inflation as measured by changes in the headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index reached about 1-3/4 percent by mid-2014 after hovering around 1 percent in the fall of 2013. Inflation seemed to be moving toward the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective, a level that the FOMC judges to be consistent with price stability because it is low enough that it does not need to figure prominently into people\u2019s and businesses\u2019 economic decisions but high enough to serve as a buffer against deflation and provide greater scope for monetary policy to address economic weakness.", "The progress seen during 2014 indicated to the FOMC that it was no longer necessary to provide increasing amounts of support to the U.S. economy by continuing to add to the Federal Reserve\u2019s holdings of longer-term securities. Accordingly, the Committee continued to reduce the pace of asset purchases over the course of the year, ending its purchases in October. That step, however, did not mark an immediate shift toward tighter monetary policy because we also indicated then that we did not expect to raise interest rates for a considerable time after the end of our securities purchases. Moreover, as the Committee explained in a set of \"normalization principles\" issued that September, the intention was to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet at an elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise its target for the federal funds rate.9", "9) The FOMC\u2019s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans are available on the Board\u2019s website at ", " c.htm. Several studies support the notion that maintaining the size of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet at an elevated level is consistent with keeping a highly accommodative policy stance, particularly when short-term interest rates are close to zero, as it was the case in 2014--see, for instance, D\u2019Amico and others (2012) and many of the references in Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015). Large Federal Reserve holdings of longer-term securities reduce the total amount of such securities available for purchase by the public, exerting upward pressure on their prices and, thus,", "We decided that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate because, while the U.S. economy was stronger and closer to meeting our statutory goals, we saw significant room for improvement. In particular, the unemployment rate still stood above our assessment of its longer-run normal level--that is, the unemployment rate that we expect to prevail when the economy is operating at maximum employment--and inflation remained below the 2 percent objective.", "Because my colleagues and I expected that labor market conditions would continue to improve and that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium term, we anticipated that the time was approaching when the economy would be strong enough that we should start to scale back our support. Indeed, the FOMC\u2019s June 2014 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) reported that nearly all FOMC participants saw a higher federal funds rate as appropriate in the next calendar year. In contrast, only two participants in December 2013 thought that it would be appropriate to start raising that rate in the next calendar year.", "Uneven Progress in 2015 and into 2016", "In 2015, the unemployment rate fell significantly faster than we generally had anticipated in 2014. However, a series of unanticipated global developments beginning in the second half of 2014--including a prolonged decline in oil prices, a sizable appreciation of the dollar, and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad--ended up having adverse implications for the outlook for inflation and economic activity in the United States, prompting the FOMC to remove monetary policy accommodation at a slower pace than we had anticipated in mid-2014.", "U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth generally surprised to the downside in 2015, reflecting, in part, weak economic activity abroad, the earlier appreciation of the dollar, and the effect of falling oil prices on business fixed investment. This unanticipated slowing in the pace of the economic recovery caused us to worry about the sustainability of ongoing improvements in employment and, thus, of likely progress toward our maximum employment goal. Our worry was reinforced by our assessment that, with the federal funds rate still near zero, there would likely be only limited scope for us to respond by lowering short-term rates if the weakening in economic activity turned out to be persistent. In contrast, if the weakening proved transitory and the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.", "Inflation also was lower than expected, with headline PCE prices rising less than 1 percent over the course of 2015, instead of around 1-3/4 percent as we had anticipated in June 2014. Much of this shortfall reflected the effects of falling oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar. My colleagues and I typically look through the effects on inflation of fluctuations in oil prices and the dollar because these effects tend to be transitory. However, we became concerned in 2015 about the risk that part of the decline in inflation could prove to be longer lasting, especially given that inflation had already been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time.10", "10) These concerns were reinforced somewhat by a decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation.", "These various considerations, along with our reassessment of longer-run economic conditions--which I will discuss shortly-- explain why the Committee ended up raising the target range for the federal funds rate only 1/4 percentage point in 2015, substantially less than the full percentage point increase suggested by the median projection of FOMC participants reported in June 2014.", "2016 also brought some unexpected economic developments that led us to proceed cautiously. During the first half of the year, mixed readings on the job market, along with additional disappointing data on real GDP growth, suggested again that progress toward the achievement of our maximum employment goal could be slowing markedly. Meanwhile, inflation hovered just below 1 percent as dollar appreciation continued to exert downward pressure on import prices, and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad--associated with concerns about the Chinese economy and the Brexit referendum--posed new risks to U.S. economic activity and inflation. Moreover, even as payroll gains turned solid again in the second half of 2016, the unemployment rate remained relatively flat, suggesting that perhaps there was more room for improvement in the job market than we had previously thought. Those unanticipated developments were part of the reason why the Committee again opted to proceed more slowly in removing accommodation than had been anticipated at the start of the year. We ended up increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by only 1/4 percentage point over the course of 2016, rather than the full percentage point suggested by our December 2015 projections.", "Reassessing Longer-Run Conditions", "The slower-than-anticipated increase in our federal funds rate target in 2015 and 2016 reflected more than just the inflation, job market, and foreign developments I mentioned. During that period, the FOMC and most private forecasters generally lowered their assessments of the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate. Indeed, at our October 2015 meeting, the FOMC had a comprehensive discussion of neutral real interest rates and was impressed by the breadth of evidence suggesting that those rates had declined both here and abroad, and that the decline had been going on for some time. In response to this growing evidence, the median assessment by FOMC participants of the longer-run level of the real federal funds rate fell from 1-3/4 percent in June 2014 to 1-1/2 percent in December 2015 and then to 1 percent in December 2016. These reassessments reflected, in part, the persistence of surprisingly sluggish productivity growth--both in the United States and abroad--and suggested that fewer federal funds rate increases would be necessary than previously thought to scale back accommodation.", "Partly in response to persistently slow wage growth, FOMC participants and private forecasters have in recent years lowered their estimates of the normal longer-run rate of unemployment. The median projection of FOMC participants of the longer-run level of the unemployment rate fell from about 5-1/4 percent in June 2014 to approximately 4-3/4 percent in December", "2016. Other things being equal, a lower longer-run level of the unemployment rate suggests that the economy has greater scope to create jobs without generating too much inflation.11", "11) The assessment that there was perhaps more room for improvement in the labor market than previously thought was reinforced by data showing that the labor force participation rate remained relatively stable in 2016, rather than declining as many had expected", "Thus, the downward revisions to FOMC participants\u2019 views on the unemployment rate over the longer run contributed to our assessment that monetary policy could stay accommodative longer than we had anticipated in 2014.", "Further Progress since Mid-2016", "The U.S. economy has exhibited remarkable resilience in the face of adverse shocks in recent years, and economic developments since mid-2016 have reinforced the Committee\u2019s confidence that the economy is on track to achieve our statutory goals. Job gains have remained quite solid, and the unemployment rate, at", "4.8 percent in January, is now in line with the median of FOMC participants\u2019 estimates of its longer-run normal level. On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat. The Committee currently assesses that the risks to the outlook are roughly balanced.", "Moreover, after remaining disappointingly low through mid-2016, inflation moved up during the second half of 2016, mainly because of the diminishing effects of the earlier declines in energy prices and import prices. More recently, higher energy prices appear to have temporarily boosted inflation, with the total PCE price index rising nearly 2 percent in the 12 months ending in January. Core PCE inflation--which excludes volatile energy and food prices and, therefore, tends to be a better indicator of future inflation--has been running near 1-3/4 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up, on net, in recent months, although they remain low.", "With the job market strengthening and inflation rising toward our target, the median assessment of FOMC participants as of last December was that a cumulative 3/4 percentage point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate over the course of this year. In light of current economic conditions, such an increase would be consistent with the Committee\u2019s expectation that it will raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a gradual pace and would bring the real federal funds rate close to some estimates of its current neutral level. However, partly because my colleagues and I expect the neutral real federal funds rate to rise somewhat over the longer run, we projected additional gradual rate hikes in 2018 and 2019.", "Our individual projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate reflect economic forecasts that generally envision that economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will be at or near 2 percent over the medium term. In short, we currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if the economic data continue to come in about as we expect. Indeed, at our meeting later this month, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.", "Nonetheless, as we have said many times--and as my discussion today demonstrates--monetary policy cannot be and is not on a preset course. As in 2015 and 2016, the Committee stands ready to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path for monetary policy if unanticipated developments materially change the economic outlook.", "Monetary Policy Is Not a Panacea", "The U.S. economy has shown great improvement and is close to meeting our congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, but we of course recognize that important challenges remain. For instance, as we noted in our latest Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, the ongoing expansion has been the slowest since World War II, with real GDP growth averaging only about 2 percent per year.12 This subdued pace reflects, in part, slower growth in the labor force in recent years--compared with much of the post-World War II period--and disappointing productivity growth both in the United States and abroad.", "Our report also noted that, despite a notable pickup in 2015, real incomes for the median family were still a bit lower than they were prior to the Great Recession, and the gains during this economic recovery have been skewed toward the top of the income distribution, as has been the case for quite some time. Families at the 10th percentile of the income distribution earned about 4 percent less in 2015 than they did in 2007, whereas families at the 90th percentile earned about 4 percent more. In addition, the economic circumstances of blacks and Hispanics, while improved since the depths of the recession, remain worse, on average, that those of whites or Asians.", "These unwelcome developments unfortunately reflect structural challenges that lie substantially beyond the reach of monetary policy. Monetary policy cannot, for instance, generate technological breakthroughs or affect demographic factors that would boost real GDP growth over the longer run or address the root causes of income inequality. And monetary policy cannot improve the productivity of American workers. Fiscal and regulatory policies--which are of course the responsibility of the Administration and the Congress--are best suited to address such adverse structural trends.", "Conclusion", "To conclude, we at the Federal Reserve must remain squarely focused on our congressionally mandated goals. The economy has essentially met the employment portion of our mandate and inflation is moving closer to our 2 percent objective. This outcome suggests that our goal-focused, outlook-dependent approach to scaling back accommodation over the past couple of years has served the U.S. economy well.", "This same approach will continue to drive our policy decisions in the months and years ahead. With that in mind, our policy aims to support continued growth of the American economy in pursuit of our congressionally mandated objectives. We do that, as I have noted, with an eye always on the risks. To that end, we realize that waiting too long to scale back some of our support could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly sometime down the road, which in turn could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Having said that, I currently see no evidence that the Federal Reserve has fallen behind the curve, and I therefore continue to have confidence in our judgment that a gradual removal of accommodation is likely to be appropriate. However, as I have noted, unless unanticipated developments adversely affect the economic outlook, the process of scaling back accommodation likely will not be as slow as it was during the past couple of years.", "SOURCE: Federal Reserve Board"]},

What, after all, remains of Mao\u2019s radical politics today? One might even wonder how familiar today\u2019s China would be for Deng, even though he\u2019s remembered as the man who opened his country to capitalist reforms.", "There\u2019s one ambitious scheme of Xi\u2019s about whose importance we may already be certain, one that will leave a big mark one way or another. It\u2019s fundamentally geopolitical in nature, though it may ultimately maintain China\u2019s historical sense of empire. The project is the ", ", which aims to be nothing less than the biggest infrastructure program the world has ever seen.", "Sometimes known as One Belt One Road, or OBOR, it will attempt to integrate China\u2019s markets with those on three continents, Asia, Europe, and Africa. The idea is to build an integrated rail network crisscrossing Central and Southeast Asia and reaching far into Europe, while constructing large, modern deep-water ports to link shipping from China and the surrounding western Pacific to South Asia, Kenya, Tanzania, and beyond.", "So far, more than 60 countries have signed on or appear inclined to participate. Together they account for about 70 percent of the Earth\u2019s population and 75 percent of its known energy supplies. Finding reasonably accurate statistics about Chinese geopolitical initiatives has long been a challenge, but under Xi, OBOR appears to have amassed well over $100 billion in commitments from various Chinese or Chinese-derived institutions, including the recently formed ", ", which some already see as a rival to the World Bank.", "Backed by Xi\u2019s personal prestige, heft on this scale has turned OBOR into a kind of organizing motif for China\u2019s politics and economy. The clear hope is that it will cement the country\u2019s place as a leading, and, perhaps someday soon, the preeminent center of gravity in the world. Distinct echoes of this kind of ambition are becoming common in the speeches of Chinese officialdom. In September, for example, Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi promoted Xi\u2019s \u201cdiplomatic thought,\u201d saying it \u201cinnovates upon and transcends the past 300 years of traditional Western international relations theory.\u201d", "Neither Chinese money nor Xi\u2019s grand ambitions are guarantees of success. It\u2019s certain OBOR will vastly improve transportation across China\u2019s Central Asian hinterland\u2014no small legacy in itself\u2014but it may not result in a major reordering of the world economy, or, for that matter, even pay off.", "Before considering why this is, it\u2019s worth noting that for all the plaudits showered on OBOR in the Chinese media, it\u2019s largely a derivative idea. Europeans proposed similar schemes in the early 1990s just after the Cold War ended. In 2011, Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, promoted a plan for something she called the \u201cNew Silk Road Initiative.\u201d Not to be left out, Japan and South Korea have also long kicked around such ideas.", "China\u2019s insight lay in repackaging these concepts as an opportunistic, nonconfrontational response to the Obama administration\u2019s proposed, but never wholeheartedly pursued, \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia, now seemingly dropped by the Trump administration. The pivot proposed recentering America\u2019s military, economic, and diplomatic energies on an increasingly prosperous East Asia to the relative detriment of the slow-growth North Atlantic and the strife-torn Middle East. Sensing U.S. inconsistency and distraction, Xi took the pre-existing ideas and doubled down on them. The question now is: What will it all yield?", "Nothing could be less certain than an immense economic payoff. This, for starters, is because of the fine details of geography. The distance between the big cities of western China and the economic heartland of Western Europe is twice as great as the distance from the East to West Coast of the U.S. In contrast to the American Midwest, the geopolitical jigsaw of Central Asia is true flyover country: Its countries are thinly populated, relatively poor, and badly governed, and have low productivity. OBOR has often been compared to the U.S. Marshall Plan, launched to redevelop Western Europe after World War II. But Chinese social scientists have themselves observed that even in the wake of that devastation, Europe had far more going for it by way of population density, industrial expertise, government know-how, cultural unity, and human capital than the Kazakhstans and Tajikistans of the world.", "Although downplayed in boosterish Chinese discussions, Beijing\u2019s desire for markets to help soak up some of its overcapacity in steel and cement is an important motive behind OBOR\u2019s focus on infrastructure\u2014especially railroad lines. In 2015, China\u2019s steel surplus was equivalent to the total output of the next four producers, Japan, India, the U.S., and Russia. Much the same is true for other key industrial materials.", "This push to develop outlets for China\u2019s badly unbalanced economy has led many to skip over basic questions about the economic rationale for a vast rail network in the first place. If the ultimate idea is to link East and West with rapid, modern freight trains, as is often suggested, what\u2019s the category of products that will benefit enough from these connections to make them profitable? Perishable and highly time-sensitive goods will almost always be transported by air. Meanwhile, no train, no matter how modern, will beat ocean freight for capacity or price per mile.", "Xi\u2019s pharaonic scheme faces geopolitical difficulties, as well. China has 17 land neighbors, many of which are privately wary of becoming more dependent on the country. This includes Russia, a situational ally that\u2019s worried about being completely eclipsed by China, and India, which sees itself as a potential peer and already a rival. Beijing hasn\u2019t figured out how to achieve the enthusiastic buy-in of these powers or even of smaller, regional actors such as Myanmar. So while an enduring legacy will be created for Xi in the form of endless miles of new railroad tracks, and seaborne commerce will increase apace, there are reasons to doubt that the OBOR initiative will live up to the hype. But even if it doesn\u2019t, one often-overlooked payoff may make it all seem worth it in the long run.", "On maps, the boundaries of China are mostly those of the huge empire stitched together by the Qing Dynasty, which ended in 1912. Its most restive regions lie in the far west, relatively poor territories such as Tibet and Xinjiang that are home to ethnic and religious minorities\u2014Buddhists and Muslims\u2014who\u2019ve resisted assimilation. Here, too, there are no guarantees. But long after Xi is gone from power, whatever the ledger books say about OBOR\u2019s profitability or return on investment, if these regions can be rendered prosperous and quiescent through transportation and trade links with the rest of the world, Chinese historians may say it was all worth it.", "\u00a0", "Everything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China\u2019s Push for Global Power"]},

Total factor productivity is the extra output that the economy produces without additional labor or capital\u2014it\u2019s what creates prosperity. While productivity in the manufacturing industry grew an average of 2.6 percent a year from 1998 to 2007, growth has been almost zero since, according to Loren Brandt, a China specialist at the University of Toronto. In the U.S., by contrast, productivity growth fell from 1 percent to about 0.5 percent over the same period, he says.", "It isn\u2019t unusual for productivity to slow once the easy gains that come from industrialization, the development of supply chains, and the embrace of technologies such as computers are used up. \u201cYou would expect productivity to come down, but not as sharply as we\u2019re seeing\u201d in China, Brandt says.", "So what explains the dramatic drop? There\u2019s a pretty obvious culprit. To combat the effects of the global financial crisis, China unleashed a 4 \u00adtrillion-yuan ($586 billion) stimulus program in 2008, much of it directed at state-owned enterprises (SOEs), to prop up growth and avoid mass layoffs. While the spending helped China avoid a deep slump, the focus on SOEs hurt the private sector. Today, state companies get almost 30 percent of all loans but contribute less than a tenth of GDP, according to Gavekal Dragonomics, a Beijing-based economic consulting firm. \u201cThe government\u2019s repeated use of state-owned enterprises to stimulate short-term activity has weakened the private sector and lowered productivity growth,\u201d Andrew Batson, research director at Dragonomics, wrote in a May report. As a result, China is \u201cincreasingly locked into a slower-growth future.\u201d", "In most economies, market competition helps drive productivity gains. But China\u2019s long love affair with industrial policy has only intensified under President Xi Jinping, as demonstrated by the launch two years ago of Made in China 2025, a blueprint for a comprehensive industrial upgrade that complements the 13th Five-Year Plan. The goal is to foster national champions in fields such as aerospace, robotics, and new energy vehicles through a combination of easy credit, subsidies, tax breaks, and other perks. In the process, Beijing and local governments are extending the life of some corporate zombies, which prevents healthier businesses from taking their place. \u201cIn dynamic economies, we expect that the really good firms are going to be more productive, be more profitable, and so they will capture more and more market share,\u201d Brandt says. \u201cWhen bad firms are forced to exit, that is an important driver of productivity. In China, that is almost not happening at all.\u201d", "China offers tax breaks to companies that invest in research and development, while some local governments, including Guangdong\u2019s, also provide subsidies for each robot a company purchases. SOEs are better positioned to take advantage of such largesse because of their ties to Communist Party cadres: So while 75 percent of SOEs spend money on R&D and 14 percent have robots, the comparable figures for private companies are 42 percent and 6 percent, according to a survey of 1,200 businesses by Wuhan University, Stanford, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.", "That private-sector businesses skimp on such productivity enhancements is a particular concern given the country\u2019s rising wages. Over the past decade, the average monthly manufacturing wage has more than doubled, to 4,126 yuan ($607), higher than in Mexico and Malaysia, according to the joint study, which was published last month. Productivity is failing to keep pace with rising wages, which is \u201cputting great pressure on the profits of countless Chinese firms,\u201d says the report.", "So what\u2019s to be done? Brandt says the impressive productivity gains China realized before 2008 resulted from a series of market-opening reforms, including the shuttering of tens of thousands of state enterprises starting in the late 1990s and the lowering of import tariffs and other barriers to \u00adcompetition\u2014a condition for the country\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. The problem is that the \u00admarket-liberalization push has pretty much stalled, he says. Xi should open protected sectors of the economy, such as telecommunications and freight hauling, to competition and allow more zombie companies to die. \u201cThere is a lot of misallocation of resources and inefficiency in the Chinese economy,\u201d Brandt says. \u201cIf they eliminate that, there\u2019s still the potential for huge productivity gains.\u201d"]},

Yet when it comes to the debt mess, he\u2019s been much less aggressive.", "Outlines are emerging of a ", " that might occur should Xi consolidate enough power in this autumn\u2019s expected Politburo leadership reshuffle. He\u2019s already been pushing financial regulators to address excessive \u00adborrowing at state-owned enterprises. China should view curbing SOE \u00adindebtedness as \u201cthe priority of priorities,\u201d Xi said at a \u00adfinancial policy gathering on July 14-15, and hold regional officials accountable \u201cfor a lifetime\u201d if they fail to prevent reckless borrowing on their watch.", "\u201cWe need that kind of political consolidation to push things forward,\u201d says Tao Dong, a Hong Kong-based senior adviser for private banking with Credit Suisse Group AG. He thinks the autumn Party Congress could be as consequential as the launch of Deng\u2019s reforms that opened China to the world in the late 1970s. \u201cAlmost every 15 years, China has a big turn. It is now at the doorstep of the next big turn,\u201d he says.", "Tapping on the brakes just enough to postpone a debt reckoning is one option. China has tremendous financial resources at its disposal, including $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, should its banks or heavily indebted companies run into trouble. Then there\u2019s the $24 trillion in domestic savings that keeps the banks awash with cash, which means they don\u2019t have to borrow from overseas. Yet thoroughly vanquishing China\u2019s debt dependency would require a willingness to allow companies to fail, a fundamental shift in the way capital is raised and allocated, and an end to the fixation on annual growth targets. \u201cGenuine deleveraging would not just mean ditching the growth target, it would mean realigning incentives through the entire economy and political apparatus,\u201d says Andrew Polk, co-founder of research firm Trivium China in Beijing.", "Too much economic growth in recent years has depended on torrents of borrowed money\u2014with debt actually growing faster than the overall economy over the past five years. And in a country where party cadres regularly rotate between top government and state enterprise jobs, there\u2019s a powerful constituency that supports borrowing and spending on big infrastructure projects. Credit is power in China. \u201cBanks behave like old Stalinist banks: the bigger the balance sheet, the better,\u201d says Michael Spencer, chief economist and head of research for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank AG in Hong Kong. \u201cUntil you change the way banks function, all you are doing is solving one problem until another one is created.\u201d", "The willingness to pump credit into uncompetitive enterprises has created a blight of zombie companies\u2014which the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development defines as \u201cold firms that have persistent problems meeting their interest payments.\u201d Despite overcapacity in such industries as steel, coal, and cement, the government is more apt to bail out or sell a faltering company than let it vanish.", "Before 2015, China\u2019s bond market experienced almost no defaults, and last year in the corporate bond market there were only 31, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The default rate is 0.1 percent, vs. about 2 percent in the U.S. Last year, Premier Li Keqiang said China must \u201cruthlessly bring down the knife\u201d on zombie enterprises in sectors with over\u00adcapacity. With the economy holding up and exports improving, Xi can afford to talk tough this year, but skeptics are waiting for results. \u201cWe need to see bankruptcies, lots of them,\u201d says Michael Every, head of financial market\u00a0research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong.", "Then there\u2019s China\u2019s overheated property sector, which is now valued more highly, relative to GDP, than the U.S. housing market was at its frothy peak in 2006. With property prices rising at double-digit rates in major cities last year, speculators are flipping properties without bothering to move in. Nationwide, there are 50 million housing units that have been sold but remain unoccupied, according to research by Gan Li, an economist at Chengdu\u2019s Southwestern University of Finance and Economics. That\u2019s enough to house every man, woman, and child in Germany and France combined.", "China has increased requirements for down payments and ordered banks to be more discerning about mortgage lending\u2014to little avail. The country has for years considered imposing a property tax to curb speculation but the idea has never gained traction amid opposition from politically well-\u00adconnected interests.", "China needs to continue modernizing its financial system. The government must also crack down on the $9.6 trillion shadow banking sector of unregulated financial institutions. One unintended side effect of Xi\u2019s early campaign against debt is that borrowers, especially real estate developers, have flocked to alternative forms of financing, according to Xu Gao, chief economist at China Everbright Securities Co. Off-balance-sheet lending surged by 754 billion yuan ($109 billion) in March from the previous month, according to the People\u2019s Bank of China.", "Just how aggressive Xi will be in defusing the corporate debt bomb is hard to say. There\u2019s no reason China can\u2019t pull together a comprehensive set of reforms that will allow it to gradually get its debt down to manageable levels while it continues to prosper and raise living standards at home. Since the debt is financed by domestic savings\u2014not foreign lenders\u2014Beijing has ample wiggle room for reform. But it has to happen. The alternative is studied inaction followed by a disorderly \u00addeleveraging that inflicts a lot of economic pain. The Chinese stock crash in 2015 was triggered in part by regulators\u2019 belated crackdown on excessive margin borrowing.", "Continuing to shovel more credit into the economy has become less effective over time and has created vast waste. Even in newer industries, where the government is spending big on subsidies and tax breaks, there is overcapacity. Does China really need more than 200 electric-vehicle makers and 800 robotics companies?", "Xi has amassed enormous power in his first five years of control, even taking the unusual step of placing himself in charge of economic policy. When it comes to managing China\u2019s debt workout, much will be riding on how wisely he uses it."]},

The extension was deemed necessary because a rally in the price of oil revived investment in the U.S. shale industry, and production has boomed.

Observers are seeking to divine what recent developments, such as Xi\u2019s rise as the party\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d leader and his ", " of one would-be successor, mean for China\u2019s biggest political event.", "It\u2019s an assembly of some 2,300 delegates from China\u2019s ruling elite, including state leaders, top executives and military generals. In theory, the events serve as China\u2019s answer to national elections, a forum to vote on policies, revise the party\u2019s charter and replace top leaders. In practice, the big decisions are hashed out by party elders and sitting leaders over months of secret meetings and handshake deals.\u00a0", "Under the personality-driven rule of Mao Zedong, congresses were infrequent and served largely to support his tumultuous political campaigns. Deng Xiaoping sought to rationalize the process, and one has been held every five years since 1977. They\u2019ve evolved into the chief engine of an orderly succession system that elevates a new general secretary every 10 years, with mid-term reshuffles in-between.\u00a0This year\u2019s event, the 19th Party Congress, will mark the halfway point of Xi\u2019s expected tenure.", "The 25-member Politburo has selected Oct. 18 as the event\u2019s opening day, right in the middle of a range of anticipated dates. While the schedule is technically a recommendation that requires approval from the broader Central Committee at a plenary session this week, that\u2019s usually a formality.", "There are no major political events scheduled before the big pageant begins. Details may already be trickling out from an August conclave at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, where party elders weigh in on the leadership\u2019s plans. In July, Sun Zhengcai -- one of two Politburo members born after 1960 -- was unexpectedly removed from his post leading the southwestern city of Chongqing. He has since been ", " for disciplinary violations. The one-time presidential contender was replaced with a Xi associate, Chen Miner.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Xi is trying to lay the groundwork to get his people in place,\u201d said Trey McArver, co-founder of research firm Trivium China. \u201cIf that means getting rid of people he doesn\u2019t trust beforehand, then so be it.\u201d", "The almost week-long event begins with a speech by Xi laying out the party\u2019s priorities -- the most authoritative policy statement in the world\u2019s second-largest economy every five years. The extent of Xi\u2019s grip on power may be seen in revisions to the party charter, in particular if he gets one of his signature slogans -- or perhaps even his name -- written into the text. Most importantly, the congress will replace about half of the 200-member Central Committee, including as many as five of the seven members on the Politburo\u2019s all-powerful Standing Committee -- if current retirement rules hold. On the last day, the top panel\u2019s new line-up will be revealed in a theatrical curtain call after the closing session. Xi\u2019s ascension to the Standing Committee a decade ago, at the ripe age of 54, telegraphed his rise to the top job in 2012.", "This is Xi\u2019s moment. Getting his ideas enshrined in the party charter and installing enough allies in top posts will determine his ability to implement policies such as overhauling the world\u2019s largest military or reducing China\u2019s $33 trillion debt pile. Moreover, Xi could amass enough power to choose his own successor, or break from recent convention and stay on for a third term. That would mark a serious departure from the consensus-driven leadership model that has reassured foreign investors for decades. \u201cIt already looks like Xi is going to have a degree of consolidation over the Politburo and the Standing Committee that we have not seen in the post-Mao era,\u201d McArver said. \u201cHe has a legitimate shot at having a majority who are close to him on both bodies.\u201d", "The event is carefully orchestrated to minimize foul-ups. That said, expectations are so high that even a minor setback could fan doubts about Xi\u2019s effectiveness going forward.\u00a0And party congress years have a way of bringing the unexpected. Before the last meeting in 2012, anti-Japanese protests broke out over a territorial dispute, Xi disappeared from public view for two weeks and Politburo member Bo Xilai was purged amid a murder scandal. The congress was widely seen as a factor in all those events. But no outsider really knows how. \u201cIt\u2019s 2017, this is the second-largest economy in the world, the way it chooses its leadership is almost a complete black box,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, engagement director at the Conference Board\u2019s China Center. \u201cAnd so all we have to go by is rumors.\u201d"]},
